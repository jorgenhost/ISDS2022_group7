Scott Walker says debt projected to double under Obama
","Possible presidential aspirant Scott Walker opens his new book with a dismal depiction of conditions in the nation’s capital. ""If you are like me, the view from Washington, D.C., these days is pretty grim,"" the Republican governor writes in ""Unintimidated: A Governor's Story and a Nation's Challenge,"" which is due out Nov. 19, 2013. ""Barack Obama has been elected to a second term. Obamacare will not be repealed anytime soon. Congress has approved massive tax increases."" Then Walker makes this claim: ""The national debt is on track to double during Obama’s presidency."" Let’s see how much the debt has grown and to what extent Obama is responsible. What is the debt? We hear plenty about the federal debt and annual federal budget deficits. So, let’s make sure we’re on the same page before we dig in. Total federal debt, also known as gross debt, is the amount of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury and other federal agencies. It has two components: Debt held by the government is money the government owes itself. Mainly, the government borrows from trust funds such as Social Security and Medicare -- payments owed to beneficiaries in the future -- to fund current government operations. Debt held by the public is owed to investors outside the federal government, including individual and corporate investors in the United States and overseas, foreign governments, the Federal Reserve and other entities. It's money the government borrows when it runs annual budget deficits -- in other words, the money the government needs to bridge the gap between what it spends and what it takes in. How much is the debt? Jacquelynn Burke, a publicist for Sentinel, Walker’s publisher, responded to our request to Walker for information to back his claim. She told us Walker was referring to total debt and to the portion held by the public and cited two documents from Obama’s own administration, a 2013 report from the Council of Economic Advisers and Obama’s 2014 budget. It’s helpful here to note that debt is tallied at the end of the fiscal year and that the federal fiscal year runs from October through September. So, fiscal 2008 started in October 2007 and ended in September 2008. The documents Walker relies on show total debt on pace to double -- from $9.99 trillion in fiscal 2008 to an estimated $20 trillion in fiscal 2016; and debt held by the public to more than double, from $5.8 trillion to $14.7 trillion. (FactCheck.org also reports that debt held by the public is on pace to double during Obama’s presidency.) Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, cited the same documents Walker did when we asked him about Walker’s claim. Edwards said that, even though fiscal 2008 ended more than three months before Obama was first inaugurated, it is a good starting point because most of the debt accumulated in fiscal 2009 was from Obama’s stimulus plan. Joshua Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition, which advocates for fiscal responsibility, argued that a better starting point is the end of fiscal 2009 -- a year later than what Walker uses -- since Obama would have been in office for nearly nine months at that point. He also argued against examining total debt, saying that since it includes borrowing from Social Security, it ""doesn't really have any economic significance."" Gordon cited figures from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for debt held by the public. They show that that portion of the total debt was $7.54 trillion at the end of fiscal 2009, but isn’t projected to double until fiscal 2019, after Obama leaves office. Gordon and Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, also made another point on comparing debt levels over time. They told us measuring debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is better for comparison purposes than simply using raw dollars. According to Congressional Budget Office figures, debt held by the public as a percentage of gross domestic product won’t double during Obama’s presidency. They show debt held by the public at the end of 2009 was equal to 52.3% of gross domestic product. That’s expected to reach 76.2% at the end of fiscal 2014, but then drop during the rest of Obama’s presidency. At the same time, the federal debt is commonly reported in raw dollars, not as a percentage of GDP. So, at least in terms of raw dollars, there is evidence that debt is projected to double during Obama’s time in office. Who's to blame Walker implied that Obama plays a role in how much the debt has grown, but he didn’t say the president caused the increase. That squares with how we’ve evaluated similar claims in the past. For one thing, each president inherits the previous president’s budget, as well as the interest payments needed to pay off debts accumulated under previous presidents. Moreover, about two-thirds of the annual deficit during Obama’s presidency term has been from entitlements and interest. Entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare, are less susceptible to a president’s policy preferences than discretionary spending that Congress must approve on an annual basis. Entitlements are also more heavily driven by demographic factors, such as the aging of the population, which is also out of any president’s control. For its part, The White House didn't challenge Walker's claim, but cited documents indicating that annual deficits are becoming smaller. A couple of other points on responsibility for the debt before we close. An analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities acknowledged that deficits and debt ""have been sharply higher under Obama."" But the analysis says the Great Recession, tax cuts adopted under President George W. Bush, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ""explain most of the deficits that have occurred on Obama’s watch."" The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, meanwhile, traces the the debt problem back even further, to around 1970, ""when the government decided to significantly increase spending without a corresponding increase in revenue."" The problem can’t be fixed, according to that analysis, ""without creating a mechanism to prevent the government from running persistent deficits in the future."" Our rating Walker said: ""The national debt is on track to double during Obama’s presidency."" Documents from Obama’s own administration indicate the debt is on pace to double in raw dollars, the way the debt is commonly reported, though not as a percentage of gross domestic product. Walker aptly indicated that Obama bears part of the blame. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.

"['Georgia', 'Economy', 'Medicaid', ""Michael Mule'""]","
More work needed on Georgia economy, Deal rival says
","Gov. Nathan Deal’s re-election chances will largely rest on how voters view his economic stewardship of the state. As political strategist James Carville once famously said about the biggest issue of the 1992 presidential race: ""It’s the economy, stupid."" So it was no surprise that Deal held a campaign rally-type event to announce that Site Selection magazine rated Georgia as the best state to do business. A top adviser to one of Deal’s opponent, though, said Georgians should not be too impressed. ""Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 a year and added 15 percent to its Medicaid rolls during the recovery,"" said Michael Mule’, an adviser to the gubernatorial campaign of Dalton Mayor David Pennington. We decided to do some fact checking to see whether Mule’ is correct. Mule’ sent us a report to back up the first part of his claim and an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article to support the latter half of his statement. First, let’s examine the latter part of his claim. In September, the AJC reported that a record 1.8 million Georgians are enrolled in Medicaid and PeachCare, the state’s child health insurance program. The AJC also reported that Georgia’s Medicaid and PeachCare rolls had increased 15 percent since June 2009, or about 240,000 additional people, according to a review of state Department of Community Health data. Since Mule’ mentioned Medicaid, and not PeachCare, we asked the DCH for specific data about Medicaid enrollment. In June 2009, there were approximately 1.36 million Medicaid recipients in the state. As of June 2013, the number of Medicaid recipients increased to nearly 1.59 million Georgians. That’s a 16.7 percent increase, according to DCH figures. On that part of the claim, Mule’ is correct. Now back to the job-loss portion of his claim. Georgia State University’s Fiscal Research Center released a report in December that examined the job climate in all of Georgia’s counties between 2000 and 2009. The report classified premium jobs as those that paid more than $50,000 a year. ""The state of Georgia experienced a decline in both premium (-13.59 percent) and low-paying (-2.74 percent) jobs over the last decade,"" the report said. The study defined low-paying jobs as those with an annual salary of less than $35,000. Mule’ was correct about the 14 percent decrease, but there was something that confused us. As we noted, the report studied 2000 through 2009. Federal economists say the recovery began in June 2009. State and federal labor officials say they do not have data detailing the percentage of Georgians making $50,000 or less since 2009. We followed up with Mule’ since his statement suggested he was referring to the number of Georgians earning more than $50,000 since the recovery.    ""The Medicaid link I sent you explicitly shows that figure was ‘during the recovery.’ Perhaps inserting a comma separating the two statistics would have dismissed any confusion on your end,"" he said via email. To sum up, Mule’, in an attempt to curb the credit Deal is claiming over the report, claimed ""Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 a year and added 15 percent to its Medicaid rolls during the recovery."" His claim is partially based on accurate numbers. He is correct about the Medicaid numbers. But his statement also leaves the impression Mule’ was saying Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 since the recovery began. PolitiFact Georgia could not find anything to back up this part of his statement. And we think it would take more than a comma to clear that up. Overall, his statement is partially accurate. But it takes things out of context when read as a whole. That’s our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2013/nov/13/michael-mule/more-work-needed-georgia-economy-deal-rival-says/

Website claims Obama administration hands out pamphlet to help counter veterans shooting up classrooms
","On Nov. 12, 2013, a blog called Mr. Conservative posted an alarming headline -- especially so given that it was just one day after the Veterans’ Day holiday. The story, which was forwarded to us by a reader, was headlined: ""Obama Admin. Hands Out Pamphlet: 'What To Do When The Veteran In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting.'"" The story went on to say that ""veterans all across the country are upset"" with the Education Department-issued pamphlet. Veterans, the site said, ""are taking the stance that this makes it look like ‘all veterans are PTSD-crazed cauldrons of rage.’ "" The Education Department’s defense, according to the post, was that there were already other pamphlets ""like ‘What To Do When The Hispanic In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting,’ ‘What To Do When The Gay Student In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting,’ and ‘What To Do When The Special-Needs Child In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting.’"" The article quoted an unnamed representative of the Veterans of Foreign Wars calling the pamphlets ""incredibly frustrating"" and saying they offered ""several asinine recommendations."" Was the story true? A lot of people seemed to think so. A number of blogs and other social media sites referenced or reposted it, and commenters on Mr. Conservative appeared to take it seriously. ""I am ashamed that we are demeaning my fellow veterans in this manner. It seems to be part of Obama's grand scheme to diminish the military,"" said one. Said another, ""What is it going to take to get this guy impeached??? If he doesn't get impeached, nobody will."" Other commenters called Obama a ""disgusting pig"" or worse. But a few Mr. Conservative commenters wondered whether it was a spoof, and it turns out that they were on to something. It was actually a piece of satire -- one that Mr. Conservative posted without labeling it as such. Though Mr. Conservative didn’t cite the original source or link to it, some quick Googling enabled us to find the source easily -- a website called the Duffel Blog, which is a satire site aimed at members of the military. Here’s the disclaimer posted on the Duffel Blog’s ""About"" page: ""We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet. Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization. No composition should be regarded as truthful, and no reference of an individual, company, or military unit seeks to inflict malice or emotional harm. All characters, groups, and military units appearing in these works are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, or actual military units and companies is purely coincidental."" Indeed, a cursory glance at the Duffel Blog front page on Nov. 12 suggests that a visitor probably would have been able to figure that out on their own. The headlines included, ""Pentagon Proposes New Antarctica Command,"" ""Applebee’s Declares Bankruptcy After Offering Free Alcohol For Veterans Day,"" and ""Paperwork Error Sends Marines To Guard Streets Of Hell"" (the last one was datelined, ""The Pearly Gates of Heaven""). Just to be sure, we also asked the Education Department, and a spokesman said the pamphlet ""is obviously not ours."" An inquiry sent through Mr. Conservative’s website was not answered, and as of publication time, the site had neither taken down the story nor labeled it as satire.  The Duffel Blog’s founder, former Marine Sgt. Paul Szoldra, did not respond to a request, but in 2012, he told Columbia Journalism Review, ""I think you have to have a dark sense of humor just to survive. ""It’s a way of coping with things beyond your control. Telling jokes or laughing about things you wouldn’t normally laugh at, especially in a combat situation, helps you cope with that kind of stress."" Our ruling The website Mr. Conservative posted an article that claimed the Obama administration was handing out a pamphlet titled, ""What To Do When The Veteran In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting."" The story originated on a satire site and was in no way real -- a truth that could have been easily discovered through a few clicks on the Internet. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. Editor's note: A few hours after our initial publication, Mr. Conservative appended an update to its post: ""Since the original posting of this article, we learned that the original news source that posted this story was not an actual news site but a satirical site. However, the fact that this story is believable, on its face, says something about our government and the society in which we now live.""",/factchecks/2013/nov/12/mr-conservative/obama-admin-pamphlet-veteran-mass-shooting/

Leno says Social Security took 7 years to issue its first check
","Editor’s note: We originally published this fact-check at 12:30 p.m. Nov. 12, 2013, with a rating of Half True. Afterward, we received additional information from the Social Security Administration, which told us that Congress amended the original Social Security Act to begin dispensing monthly checks in 1940. As such, we are republishing this item with a rating of Mostly False. NBC’s Tonight Show is usually a pundit-free zone. But on Nov. 8, 2013, host Jay Leno entered the pundit world during a newsmaker interview with Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. As Cruz made his case against the Affordable Care Act, Leno pushed back a bit. Leno said it was too early to declare the entire program a failure. ""Social Security took seven years before anybody got the first check,"" Leno said. ""It was seven years before anyone got anything."" That claim sent us to the history books to see if it was true, and even more important, to learn what explained the delay. Social Security broke new legal ground Just as with today’s Affordable Care Act, a big constitutional cloud hung over the Social Security Act. It became law on Aug. 14, 1935, but its future was murky until the U.S. Supreme Court declared it valid. ""When the federal government seeks to expand its influence in new areas, it must find some basis in the Constitution to justify its action,"" wrote historian Larry DeWitt with the Social Security Administration. The rationale for doing what the government had never done before was rooted in the constitutional authority to collect taxes to ""promote the general welfare."" Congress bought that argument but whether the court would agree was very much in doubt. The court did not rule for nearly two years. In the interim, the newly appointed Social Security managers were tackling an operational challenge that DeWitt calls unprecedented. ""The record keeping involved was on a scale never before attempted,"" DeWitt wrote. ""By the time of the court's ruling in May 1937, more than 26 million Social Security numbers had been issued; around $150 million in taxes had been collected; a dozen or so benefit claims had already been paid, and there were about 150 local field offices in operation around the country."" We’ll say more about those early benefit claims in just a bit. Savvy planning Unlike the Affordable Care Act, Social Security was set up as a standalone insurance program. (Today’s debate over whether it truly lives up to that is a separate question.)  As an insurance program, it needed to build up reserves before it could start paying out benefits. Plus, because it tied benefits to earnings, there had to be time for workers to log enough pay to qualify for those monthly checks. The original Social Security Act, in Section 202, said people would have to wait until Jan. 1, 1942, before they could start receiving monthly checks. That would be seven years after passage. But Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to move up the issuance of monthly checks, the Social Security Administration told PunditFact. The first monthly check was issued in 1940, the Social Security Administration told us. That’s roughly five years, not seven. The law had another wrinkle. The administration and Congress added a feature to do a little something for people who retired before then. For the years 1937 to 1939, one-time lump sum checks went out to retirees, or if they died, to their estates. DeWitt says the very first beneficiary was an Ohio streetcar motorman named Ernest Ackerman. ""Ackerman worked one day under Social Security — Jan. 1, 1937. His wage for that day was $5. He dutifully paid his payroll tax of one nickel and he received a one-time check from Social Security for 17 cents."" In the few years of this temporary program, about 441,000 people got checks and the total payments were more than $25 million. Our ruling Leno said after Social Security passed, it was seven years before ""anybody got the first check."" That’s what was intended, but Congress amended the law in 1939 to move up the issuance of monthly checks, the Social Security Administration told us. Moreover, people received lump sum checks in from 1937 to 1939. That interim effort involved a lot of people and a fair chunk of change. There’s an element of truth to Leno’s claim, but not much more. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/nov/12/jay-leno/leno-says-social-security-took-7-years-issue-its-f/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Scott Brown']","
Scott Brown says opponents delayed his swearing-in to pass health care law
","Former Massachusetts Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown took a stroll down memory lane Monday while talking about the health care law with Fox News’ Gretchen Carlson. Brown, who is now a Fox News contributor, claimed the architects of Obamacare delayed Brown’s swearing-in in 2010 to help ""ram"" the law through Congress. ""They rammed it through before I got there, knowing I would be there in a week or two,"" Brown said on The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson. ""They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram it through and did not pass one amendment to make it better for the American people, and they should be held accountable."" As Brown finished his point about his swearing-in, people watching could hear Carlson say, ""I remember."" But did she remember right? Brown was elected in a 2010 special election to finish the term of the late-Sen. Edward Kennedy. When Kennedy died on Aug. 25, 2009, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick appointed a Democrat, Paul Kirk, to hold his seat. State law requires a special election for federal seats to be held between 145 and 160 days of when the vacancy occurred -- or in the case of Kennedy’s seat somewhere between Jan. 17, 2010, and Feb. 1, 2010. Massachusetts’ election was Jan. 19, 2010, the first Tuesday in that window. Brown, who had campaigned on being the 41st vote against the health care legislation, defeated Democrat Martha Coakley by a vote of 52 percent to 47 percent. Brown’s victory did not mean he could just move to Capitol Hill and start casting votes the next day. Brown was sworn in Feb. 4, 2010, 16 days after his election. Was his swearing-in ceremony delayed? No. Cities and towns in Massachusetts have 15 days to send final results to the Massachusetts Secretary of State, including a 10-day window for counting absentee and overseas ballots. ""It wasn’t delayed,"" said Brian McNiff, a spokesman for Secretary of State William Galvin. ""This process had to be done."" In fact, Brown was sworn in a week earlier than he had planned, according to media reports. After receiving criticism of his ""three-week victory lap"" from a newspaper columnist, he wrote state officials asking for his election results to be certified immediately. The results were certified by the governor’s council and sent to the U.S. Senate ""as soon as the ink was dry,"" McNiff said. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill So if anything, Brown’s swearing-in actually came a week earlier than originally planned. But what about the Democrats in Washington? Did they scramble to pass health care reform before Brown took his seat? Again, no. Weeks before Brown’s election, the Senate had already passed its version of health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, on Dec. 24, 2009, on a 60-39 vote. (Kirk voted yes.) But the legislation needed to pass the House, and House Democratic leaders wanted to make changes that echoed their priorities. Problem was, any big changes to the Senate bill would send it back to the upper chamber for final approval, where the 39 Republicans and the newly elected Brown could now filibuster the bill. Top Democrats wondered what to do. One option widely reported before Brown’s election was to pass the health care law before Brown took his seat. But on Jan. 20, 2010, the day after Brown’s election, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nv., took that plan off the table. ""We’re going to wait until the new senator arrives until we do anything more on health care,"" Reid said. In the end, the House passed the Senate bill on March 21, 2010. On that same day, the House passed a slew of their own measures in a separate bill, which the Senate passed March 25, 2010, through a filibuster-proof process known as reconciliation. One last point: Brown’s 16-day wait from election to swearing-in is in line with other recent Senate special elections. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was elected after the death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg on Oct. 16, 2013, and sworn in 15 days later on Oct. 31, 2013. And Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey won the special election to replace John Kerry on June 25, 2013, and did not take the oath of office until July 16, 2013 -- 21 days later. Our ruling Brown said, ""They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram (the health care law) through."" We never heard back from Brown, but the record is pretty clear on this. His swearing-in wasn’t delayed, and the Senate did not ""ram"" the health care law through in the time between his election and his taking the oath of office. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2013/nov/12/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-opponents-delayed-his-swearing-pa/
"['Gambling', 'Florida', 'Frank  Fahrenkopf']","
Gaming advocate says most people go to high-end casinos for amenities, not gambling
","Celine Dion concerts. Michelin-star restaurants. Luxurious spas. Could such amenities, instead of gambling, now be the biggest draw in high-end casinos? That’s the claim Frank J. Fahrenkopf, the recently retired CEO of the American Gaming Association, made in an opinion piece on South Florida resort casinos and regulations that he wrote for the Miami Herald. ""The majority of people travelling to these destination resorts are not going for the primary purpose of gambling,"" he wrote. ""They are visiting to dine at five-star restaurants, watch incredible live shows or participate in business meetings or conventions. Every year, thousands of people flock to these resorts to watch golf tournaments or tennis matches and never set foot in a casino.""  Fahrenkopf wrote that these types of resorts flourish in Las Vegas, Singapore, and Macau, adding, ""There’s no doubt they will succeed in South Florida, too."" His vision of an amenities-packed resort refers to the type of luxury casino model initially suggested by The Genting Group when it purchased the Miami Herald’s former bayfront property for $236 million, or the kind of large-scale destination the Las Vegas Sands Corp. is pursuing in Florida.  The state Legislature is in the midst of high-stakes hearings taking place around Florida as lawmakers consider regulations and possible expansion of gambling, with meetings scheduled Nov. 14 and 15 in Pensacola and Jacksonville. The state already allows the Florida Lottery, the pari-mutuel industry (offering slot machines and card rooms) and Indian casinos.  We wondered about Fahrenkopf’s factual claim that a majority of people traveling to destination resorts are not going primarily to gamble.  Different resorts, different results Fahrenkopf said his evidence was an annual study done by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which reported in 2012 that 47 percent of all visitors said their primary reason for visiting Las Vegas was vacation or pleasure. Eight percent said they came primarily to gamble.  When we reviewed the methodology of the study, we noticed that the survey asked an open-ended question: ""What was the primary purpose of THIS trip to Las Vegas?"" People could then give any answer they wished, and 47 percent answered ""vacation/pleasure."" Only 8 percent volunteered the answer ""to gamble."" We wondered if some people who answered ""vacation/pleasure"" chose the city as their vacation spot because it had gambling. But because of the survey's structure, though, we can't know if that's the case or not. Also, the question only applies to the city of Las Vegas. It might not apply to other cities that have casinos.  David G. Schwartz,  director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told PolitiFact Florida that Fahrenkopf’s numbers ""seem accurate"" for Las Vegas, but he noted other markets face tougher odds.   Consider Atlantic City.  The $2.4 billion Revel casino in Atlantic City, for example, is a casino resort that focused on amenities and entertainment instead of slots or blackjack, and it faces financial failure. Revel opened in April 2012 and lasted less than a year before filing for bankruptcy. Company officials have changed the name to Revel Casino-Hotel, and said they are paying more attention to the gambling side of the business now.  Not that being casino-centric has helped other Atlantic City casinos -- half of Atlantic City’s 12 casinos have filed for bankruptcy protection in the past six years, according to the Associated Press. The Atlantic Club, which filed Nov. 7, is the latest.  John Sowinski, president of nocasinos.org, said that while amenities might draw nongamblers, Vegas is famous primarily as a gambling destination. ""If people are going to these resorts for the amenities and not the gambling, then why do we need casinos?"" Sowinski said. ""Why climb Mount Everest politically to make this happen? … Other places can’t afford to have Celine Dion or Elton John perform."" Indeed, even the American Gaming Association’s 2013 State of the State report shows that most people -- 53 percent -- who frequent casinos across the country always, or almost always, gamble.  We should note the report also showed that people who go to resorts definitely take advantage of amenities. It found that 69 percent of all casinogoers ate at a fine dining restaurant while at a casino and 62 percent saw a show.  But Fahrenkopf’s assertion side steps a central issue with Florida’s current gambling industry: Residents, not tourists, account for 93 percent of the $2.4 billion in estimated revenue collected by existing casinos, according to a recent report commissioned by the state Legislature. Spectrum Gaming Group of Atlantic City assessed the economic impact of existing and expanded gambling on local communities before lawmakers draft legislation to revise gaming regulations. The Spectrum report also found that 38.2 percent of adults in Florida live within an hour of a casino and gamble there at least once a year.  In contrast, ""Las Vegas does not rely on its residents"" for the city’s gambling industry, said Joseph Weinert, senior vice president of the Spectrum Gaming Group, noting that top-notch attractions set Las Vegas apart from other casinos across the country. ""The 24 largest resorts in Vegas are getting two-thirds of their revenue from nongaming sources,"" he said.  The Spectrum report notes that by the late 1980s, gaming revenue in Las Vegas was down as other areas in the country started to legalize gambling. The city has been revitalized by becoming more of a party destination, according to the Spectrum report. ""Attracting 21- (to) 34-years-olds from all over the world, Las Vegas now ranks No. 1 in categories such as, top destination for bachelor and bachelorette celebrations.""  Our ruling Fahrenkopf said that ""the majority of people"" traveling to destination resorts are not going primarily to gamble. He said he based this on a study done by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which showed that most visitors said they came to Las Vegas for vacation or pleasure. But we see two problems with this evidence. First, the survey applied only to Las Vegas. To say that its findings apply to all resorts, regardless of location, seems like a stretch. Second, people may have chosen to visit Las Vegas for vacation or pleasure primarily because it had gambling. The survey didn't press people for more details on their answers, so we can't know for sure. Meanwhile, a 2013 report from the American Gaming Association showed that most people -- 53 percent -- who frequent casinos across the country always, or almost always, gamble. Also, Florida casinos tend to draw from the local population. Whether Florida could draw visitors in the same way Las Vegas does remains to be seen.  Fahrenkopf has a point that people who travel to destination resorts may have other things in mind besides gambling. But the evidence shows gambling is still an important part of the equation. We rate his statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2013/nov/12/frank-fahrenkopf/gaming-advocate-says-most-people-go-high-end-casin/
"['Oregon', 'Debt', 'Dennis Linthicum']","
Has the national debt tripled since Rep. Greg Walden was elected to Congress?
","U.S. Rep. Greg Walden may be a member of the House GOP leadership, but that hasn’t protected him from allegations that he’s too liberal for his conservative base -- or from drawing a primary challenger. Late last month, Klamath County Chairman Dennis Linthicum announced he would try to oust Walden in the 2014 Republican primary. Part of Linthicum’s motivation, he told The Oregonian, is that he sees Walden as a career politician who doesn’t stand up for conservative values. On his campaign website, Linthicum offers the nation's ever-increasing public debt as one piece of evidence: ""During Walden’s time as a representative (nearly 16 years) the National Debt has tripled."" We constantly hear about the nation’s trillions of dollars worth of debt, but has it really tripled in the time that Walden has been in office? We wanted to find out. Looking up the public debt -- past and present -- is a fairly simple exercise. The U.S. Department of the Treasury Bureau of the Public Debt has a handy website that lets you look up the debt on just about any date. Before we shower you with numbers, though, a quick note: As with almost anything we dig into, debt is a complex subject. When you talk about the total debt held by the U.S., there are two oft-cited measures. The first is the total outstanding public debt. That’s everything we owe to all of our debt-holders, no distinction made. Then there’s the debt held by the public. That’s our total debt minus intragovernmental debt or money owed by one part of the government to another part of the government. One economist we spoke to said the second one was generally ""a little better measure."" To be safe, we checked the growth of both. Walden began his service as a U.S. congressman in January 1999. The closest date we could find for which the Treasury had estimates of both sorts of debt was Sept. 30, 1999, so we went ahead and used that date and compared it with the most recent figures available, from Nov. 7. Here’s what we found: Back in 1999, the total outstanding public debt was $5.6 trillion. These days, it’s a little north of $17 trillion. In other words, it’s tripled. The U.S. debt minus the intragovernmental loans was $3.6 trillion back in 1999 and is about $12.1 trillion these days. So, that’s more than tripled. Of course, we’re not economists so our next step was to call some experts. We spoke with Tom Potiowsky, the chair of the Economics Department at Portland State University and the former chief economist for the state of Oregon, and Mark Thoma, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. They both had little doubt that Linthicum’s claim is accurate, but they did provide us with some caveats. Thoma noted that comparing our debt now, on the heels of a recession, to debt from 1999 when the economy was in better shape, might be somewhat deceiving. We’ve had to spend far more on social programs, for instance. ""To me, it’s misleading to use a recession as your end point,"" he said. Potiowsky questioned whether it’s fair to hang the debt growth on Walden -- something we’ll get to later. And both Thoma and Potiowsky suggested we look at the U.S. debt relative to the nation’s gross domestic product. If the economy were expanding as quickly as the debt, that would be important to note. We dug back into the numbers. In 1999 the debt-to-GDP ratio (if you use the entire debt) was 57 percent. These days, it’s 101 percent. So it’s just about doubled. Meanwhile, if you skim off the intragovernmental debt, the ratio in 1999 was 36 percent and is 72 percent today. Again, it’s doubled. The takeaway, then, is that debt is growing and it’s growing faster than our GDP. We called Linthicum to ask whether it’s fair to pin this all on Walden. ""I realize that Greg Walden is one member of the House, and there’s the Senate and there’s the president and his policies,"" he said. ""I was just making what I saw as a statement of fact."" That may be so, but given that Linthicum uses the claim on a campaign website specifically to draw contrasts between him as a fiscal conservative and Walden as somebody who has let the debt skyrocket, it’s hard not to read it as an attack. The blame, though, is largely misplaced. You’d also have to account for entitlement program growth and the impact of the recession. His statement is accurate but he can’t pin the bulk of the growth on Walden, who is one of hundreds of lawmakers and three presidents to serve since 1999. We rate the statement Half True.

Charlie Crist says Rick Scott cut K-12 by $1.3 billion in his first year and higher ed by $300 million in his second
","Former Gov. Charlie Crist has portrayed Gov. Rick Scott as taking a chainsaw to the state’s education budget. Crist, now a Democrat, spoke about education funding in an interview with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Nov. 5, 2013, the day after he announced that he would challenge the Republican governor. (Crist was a Republican governor in 2007 but left the party while running for his failed U.S. Senate bid in 2010.) ""First thing he does when he comes in, Chuck, is cut education by $1.3 billion,"" Crist said. ""That’s an incredible decrease. Then in his second year he decreases funding by $300 million to our state universities."" Scott and his backers have touted teacher pay raises that Scott pushed this year, while the Democrats have attacked him for cuts. In this fact-check we will explain if Scott cut education by $1.3 billion in his first year in office in 2011 and then in the second year cut $300 million from state universities. K-12 budget  As Scott approached his first legislative session in 2011, he unveiled a budget proposal at a tea party rally that included steep spending cuts, including to education. Ultimately, the Republican-led Legislature backed some of those cuts. Multiple news articles described the cuts to K-12 education at more than $1 billion -- and many articles used that $1.3 billion figure cited by Crist. A Senate budget subcommittee conference report during the 2011 session shows a cut of about $1.35 billion. But not all of that cut was as a result of reduced state funding -- the largest chunk of the decline was due to the fact that the two years of federal stimulus funds had expired. In 2009-10 and 2010-11, the state received federal stimulus dollars. (Crist was the governor when the state accepted the stimulus.) When the state got the stimulus, it reduced the state’s contribution by the same amount. When the stimulus funds expired, Scott and the Legislature chose not to fully reinstate the state dollars. The Florida Education Finance Program, the main source of dollars for K-12 education, is by law a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars called the ""required local effort"" -- and the state dictates the amount. Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, the state cut its own contribution to education funding by about $200 million, but it also reduced the local contribution by $572 million. Add in the lost federal stimulus money of $870 million, and we get $1.6 billion in funding reductions. Finally, there were other things happening that reduced funding for schools, said Ruth Melton, legislative director for the Florida School Boards Association. During this same time period most school districts lost the authority to levy local discretionary millage (a loss of about $200 million) and had to serve an additional 25,000 students (an additional cost of about $155 million). On the plus side of the ledger, the state did get more federal aid apart from the stimulus, of about $555 million through a program known as Education Jobs Fund Program. ""In short, I can make a very strong case that the cut between 2010-11 and 2011-12 was more than $2 billion, but I can also find my way to agreeing that the cut was about $1.4 billion,"" Melton said. ""Whatever the case, it seems that the bottom line is that the state could have increased state and local funding levels to cover, at a minimum, the loss of the (stimulus) funds, but chose not to do so."" The education cuts aren’t on Scott’s plate alone, but he was one of the main driver’s behind them. Scott proposed even steeper cuts to education, and in the end he signed off on the budget crafted by the Legislature. By December 2011, Scott did a major about-face and called for a $1 billion boost to education, though that did not fully cover the previous cut. ""I will not sign a budget that does not significantly increase state funding for education,"" Scott said at a news conference in the Capitol, the Tampa Bay Times reported. ""We've got to really focus on education."" With an eye toward his 2014 re-election campaign, Scott has touted education funding increases. The Department of Education’s powerpoint shows funding hit a recent low of $16.6 billion in 2010-11. But then, over the next two years, it rose to $18.3 billion in 2013-14. But that’s still lower than the pre-recession level -- in 2007-08 the total was $18.7 billion. One of Scott’s victories in the most recent session was persuading the Legislature to agree to his plan for $480 million in teacher raises. Scott’s spokesman also cited a 2013 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that said Florida had the second-largest per pupil increase in education spending for the 2013-14 budget year, only behind Oregon. But despite that increase, the report also showed that Florida was among the majority of the states where funding per student remained lower than 2008. Higher education Crist specified cuts to the state’s universities, not state colleges and community colleges, so we will focus this part of our fact-check on state funding for universities. State appropriations for universities dropped by $303.7 million between 2011 and 2012, according to the Florida Board of Governors. Lawmakers assumed that universities would dip into reserves and increase tuition up to 15 percent to cover the shortfall. In 2013, lawmakers approved restoring the $300 million, and schools received additional money for particular projects. That means the total state appropriations (general revenue plus education enhancements) grew by about $519 million between 2012-13 and 2013-14. ""For the first time in seven years, our universities did not see their budgets cut,"" wrote Frank Brogan, chancellor of the State University System, in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times. ""This is a welcome change that we hope signals the state's long-term re-investment in higher education, particularly following years in which students have shouldered more and more of the costs."" Why would the Legislature slash $300 million only to restore it -- and then some -- the next year? The Legislature looked at universities’ reserves and found they had more than $1 billion, well above the legal requirement of about $250 million, said Tim Jones, chief financial officer for the Board of Governors. So the Legislature essentially told universities that the state was going to cut $300 million to balance the budget, and universities could use reserves to cover the loss. The plan was that it would be a one-year cut and they’d get their money back the following year if the state budget outlook was brighter. ""Universities know that every year kind of stands alone,"" Jones said. ""If the (state’s) budget had been bad, they could have said, ‘Sorry, we can’t restore it this year."" Our ruling Crist said that Gov. Rick Scott ""cut education by $1.3 billion"" in his first year and then ""in his second year he decreases funding by $300 million to our state universities."" There are various ways to add up the total cuts in K-12. Crist uses the $1.3 billion figure that includes the cut in state and state-required local dollars, but the largest chunk was due to the expiration of the stimulus funds. The state also cut $300 million from universities during Scott’s second legislative session. We should note that much of K-12 education funding was restored, though it’s still below pre-recession levels. And the Legislature restored the cut to universities the next year. The bottom line, though, is that Crist chose his words carefully, and those cuts did happen during the years he mentioned. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/nov/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-cut-k-12-13-billion-/

Gwinnett chairwoman's SPLOST savings claim makes sense
","The election results are in, but we still had a question concerning a particular item on the ballot in Georgia’s second-largest county that seemed worthy for a fact check. Gwinnett County officials had an interesting sales pitch to voters about the merits of continuing a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax to pay for various projects. It would cost the county more money if they had to borrow the cash instead of collecting it in sales taxes. How much more? One billion dollars. Here’s a passage about it from an interview with Gwinnett Commission Chairwoman Charlotte Nash in the Gwinnett Daily Post: ""SPLOST is the best tool that the Legislature has ever given local government,"" Nash said, adding that finance experts estimate that paying in cash for the $2.5 billion in projects funded by the sales tax saved the county more than $1 billion in interest payments that would have been owed if debt had been issued. ""It allowed us to work on those quality of life things, and we were able to do it without debt."" PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Gwinnett would have spent $1 billion in interest payments had the county borrowed the money for the projects as opposed to collecting revenue from the sales tax. Gwinnett voters passed the county’s first SPLOST program in June 1985. They’ve approved SPLOST referendums in 1987, 1991, 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008. Since 1985, Gwinnett officials say they’ve collected about $2.5 billion in SPLOST revenue. On Nov. 5, Gwinnett voters approved the latest SPLOST referendum by a 58-42 percent margin. The sales tax would raise $498 million over the next three years. More than two-thirds of the money will be spent on roads, bridges, drainage, sidewalks, intersection improvements and other transportation projects. The county’s 16 cities will collect about $100 million. The rest will be spent on public safety equipment; parks; library and senior citizen facilities; water and sewer improvements; and parking. Gwinnett officials told PolitiFact Georgia they calculated the potential interest rates by using a municipal index scale for counties with AAA bond ratings. Gwinnett gave us the average interest rates for a 20-year deal originated at the beginning of the year for each time period. The interest rates ranged from 8.9 percent in 1985 and gradually declined to 3.85 percent for the SPLOST passed in 2004. The interest rate for the SPLOST referendum passed in 2008 was not included in the county’s calculations. Several experts we spoke with said the county’s methodology appeared sound. ""In order for the county to have accomplished the capital outlay projects funded by the SPLOSTs, it would have either had to impose massive property tax increases to fund the projects or borrow money to finance the projects. Borrowing money to finance the projects would have been less painful for the property taxpayers than imposing millage rate increases to fund the projects, because debt can be paid off over 20-30 years,"" said Earle Taylor III, who has spent about three decades working on public financing projects and is a partner at the law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge. Ray Hill, who teaches managerial economics and finance at Emory University, said the county’s claim is based on the assumption that Gwinnett would have borrowed that much money. Hill and Taylor didn’t see any glaring holes in the county’s calculations. ""If the assumption was that, in any event, the county was going to spend an amount of money equal to the SPLOST revenues, it would be easy to get to an interest ‘saving’ figure of $1 billion,"" said Hill, who is an expert in financing large projects. ""The potential interest rates look reasonable. If you assumed they issued a 20-year bond at the amounts listed, you could easily get interest payments that total $1 billion."" To sum up, Nash said Gwinnett County would have spent $1 billion in interest payments had the county borrowed the money for the projects as opposed to collecting revenue from the sales tax. Experts we interviewed agreed with the county’s methodology and math. We did our own calculations, and it appeared to us that they would have paid more than $1 billion in interest had they borrowed $2.5 billion.

Chris Christie vetoed Planned Parenthood funding 5 times, Hilary Rosen claims
","Democratic pundit Hilary Rosen isn’t buying all the talk about newly re-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie being a moderate Republican. In a roundtable discussion on CNN’s State of the Union, Rosen painted Christie as out of touch when it comes to women’s reproductive issues. ""Women consistently bring Democrats over the top in these purple states,"" Rosen said during the Nov. 10 show. ""When you look at Chris Christie and you try and take that forward, you’ve got an anti-choice candidate who has vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times over the course of his governorship."" With four budgets under his belt, did Christie really veto money for Planned Parenthood five times? Rosen tweeted us a story from LifeNews.com, which opposes abortions, and a (Newark) Star-Ledger newspaper editorial that referenced five vetoes. We looked into it ourselves and found Christie has used his executive power several times to deny funding for family planning clinics, including but not exclusively limited to Planned Parenthood. As a result of the cuts at least six clinics have closed, including two affiliated with Planned Parenthood, our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey found. The vetoes have been a real sore spot between the governor and the Democrat-led Legislature since Christie took office. So how many were there exactly? It depends on how you count them. We compiled a timeline using clips from the Star-Ledger and interviews with Planned Parenthood representatives. We could not reach a Christie spokesperson by our deadline. In March 2010, Christie proposed his first budget recommendations amid a $10 billion shortfall with across-the-board cuts, including an $820 million cut for schools. This budget, which outlined Christie’s priorities but still needed approval from the Democratic legislators, also included the elimination of $7.5 million for ""family planning services."" Legislators then responded by passing a bill to add that funding back in the budget. But Christie struck back. On June 23, 2010, Christie vetoed SB 2139, which aimed to restore $7.5 million in grants for the state’s 58 women’s health and family planning centers, including Planned Parenthood. In his veto letter, Christie cited the state’s budget bind and the existence of other clinics that could perform these services. ""Reproductive health services will continue to be available in each of New Jersey’s 21 counties, including Planned Parenthood clinics, local health department clinics, free standing clinics and hospital-based clinics,"" he wrote. ""Nearly 95,000 women will still receive care through these family planning sites."" The Legislature tried again the next year. Again Christie said no. Christie vetoed $7.5 million for the family planning centers in the 2011-12 state budget. Same story in 2012. The Legislature passed a supplemental bill, AB 788, to restore the money for family planning centers, but Christie vetoed it. Lastly, on June 29, 2013, Christie vetoed a measure, SB 2825, from Democrats that again tried to restore the $7.5 million for family planning services. That's four clear vetoes, plus the original cut. Additionally, in 2011 and again in 2013, Christie vetoed proposals to expand the state's Medicaid program to cover family planning services for people who earn up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Services would have included things such as birth control and cervical exams but not abortion, according to the Star-Ledger. The Medicaid expansion would not have directly provided money for Planned Parenthood, but it ""would have provided a new revenue stream to allow Planned Parenthood health centers to see additional patients and offer additional services, said Ed Remsen, executive director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey. So that could be two additional vetoes, depending on how you count it. Marie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life, pointed out that Christie has maintained funding for other health services and that he defeated a female candidate who made this an issue, suggesting that Rosen’s theory about women not liking Christie rings hollow. Our ruling Rosen said Christie ""vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times over the course of his governorship."" Rosen is largely correct, though different people might come to a different figure.

18 states have voted Democratic in six consecutive elections with 242 electoral votes, George Will says
","The lopsided re-election of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has ignited talk about Christie’s 2016 presidential prospects. In his victory speech, Christie, eyes straight at the camera, invited the rest of the country to see what a Republican could achieve in New Jersey. Conservative pundit George Will said the prospect of flipping a blue state could be Christie’s trump card if he does decide to run for president. ""He will turn to the Republicans now and say, ‘Your problem is the 18 states and the District of Columbia that have voted democratic in six consecutive presidential elections,’"" Will said on Fox News Sunday. ""Those 18 states, which include New Jersey by the way, have 242 electoral votes. If the Democratic presidential nominee can assume those states, he or she will spend the autumn of 2016 looking for 28 electoral votes, and he or she will find them."" It’s a simple matter of going to the electoral college record to see if Will has his numbers right, and he does. While about one third of the states have moved from one party to the other over the past 24 years, Democrats have been able to hold on to a larger number than Republicans. More importantly, the Democratic states have bigger populations and thus deliver more electoral votes. Democrats can count on the two big prizes of California and New York, while Republicans can counter with just one super-sized state, Texas. The average state in the blue column delivers 13 electoral votes; the average on the red side is 8.

Chris Christie tells teacher school funding is highest it's ever been
","Chris Christie’s heard the complaints often. He cut education funding. He supports charter schools. He’s hard on teachers, and his quest for tenure and other reforms is over the top. But the governor continues responding to those complaints with various versions of this refrain: New Jersey has the most funding put toward education in state history. And Christie said it again Nov. 2 during a gubernatorial campaign stop in Somers Point, when he and a public school teacher got into an argument. Christie was re-elected Tuesday. ""In fact, there’s more state funding for education today than any other time,"" Christie said when the teacher cited the governor’s education funding cuts for why he has referred to New Jersey schools as ""failure factories."" Technically Christie is right about the level of education funding in New Jersey, but as we’ve pointed out in the past, there’s a bit more to this story that he doesn’t address. First, let’s get back to that remark about ‘failure factories.’ Christie used it during a speech he gave Oct. 6 to the Orthodox Union in Teaneck, where he promoted his education policies. ""I would be happy to take as many dollars as possible away from failure factories that send children on a no-stop route to prison and to failed dreams, if we could take that money and put it into a place where those families have hope,"" Christie said. Now, to the governor’s point about education funding. Christie’s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget called for nearly $9 billion in education funding, about $1 billion more than the previous year. Under that spending plan, state aid to schools increased $97 million. While no district saw a state aid decrease, many either received an increase of $1 or their funding stayed the same as the previous year. At the time, Christie released a statement through the state Department of Education in which he touted the funding level while also emphasizing fiscal restraint. ""However, even as we continue to fund education at the highest levels in state history, we must remain willing to reflect on how we are spending our money and work towards solutions that make every dollar we invest count,"" he said in the statement. We’ve previously run Christie’s claim past Steve Wollmer, a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union. Wollmer agreed that in terms of dollars, it’s correct that the state has its highest-ever level of education funding. But that doesn’t mean there hasn't a been long-lasting downside to cuts that Christie made during his first year as governor. He took office in January 2010. ""But what he doesn’t mention is that he cut $1.3 billion from state aid in his first year – Withholding $475 million in aid in January, which was the amount that the state’s nearly 600 districts had in total surpluses for unanticipated expenses (a new roof, a bus that needed replacing, an unanticipated special ed placement), and another $820 million in the FY11 budget (which began for schools in September of 2010),"" Wollmer said previously in a statement to PolitiFact New Jersey. ""Districts cut back dramatically, and 10,000 teachers and staff were laid off, programs were cut, and class sizes increased."" Those cuts continue to sting, Wollmer said. In addition to the cuts, the New Jersey Supreme Court in 2011 ordered Christie to increase aid to the now-former Abbott districts by about $500 million. Our ruling Christie last week said during an argument with a teacher, ""In fact, there’s more state funding for education today than any other time."" Critics frequently call the governor out for the massive funding cuts he’s made to education since taking office, and for either increasing state aid by a minimal amount or not at all. But the fact of the matter is that despite the cuts, New Jersey’s education funding level is the highest it’s ever been. For that reason, we rate Christie’s statement True.

Gubernatorial candidate Mayor Allan Fung says his administration created over 1,000 jobs in Cranston
","Announcing his candidacy for governor on Nov. 4, Republican Allan Fung promised he would create 20,000 jobs in Rhode Island during his four-year term in office. As evidence that he can do it, he pointed to his own record as the mayor of Cranston. ""Hospitality, manufacturing, retail. In each of these industries we have created new jobs here in Cranston -- more than 1,000,"" Fung said in a speech at Taco Inc., in Cranston. ""And this is what I intend to do as governor in every community in the state of Rhode Island."" Such claims, common in political campaigns, are not always easy to check. The cause-and-effect relationship between the office of mayor, governor or president and how many jobs are won and lost in a community is complicated. So there is some hyperbole here. Unless a municipality directly hires workers, it doesn't literally ""create"" new jobs, any more than Barack Obama ""created"" about 3.6 million jobs during his first term as president. Finally, Fung took office on Jan. 5, 2009, when the economy was still in a nose-dive and the stock market was just two months away from its lowest point since May 1997. Nonetheless, we decided to check Fung’s claim. We called Fung's chief of staff and the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. DLT cautioned us that because local employment statistics vary on a seasonal basis from month to month, the only reliable way to compare time periods for a city is to select comparable months or full years. According to its data, from January 2009 to January 2013, the net gain of private-sector jobs in Cranston increased by 1,121, going from 26,631 to 27,752. (In that same time period, the number of employed Rhode Islanders declined by 1,099.) (If you add in government jobs -- federal, state and local -- the increase was 1,294, but Fung's speech focused on the private sector. The increase is even higher if you look at annual numbers -- 1,684 in additional private sector jobs from 2008, the year before Fung took office, to 2012.) So there's reason to believe that Fung's ""more than 1,000"" number is correct, even when you include jobs lost in the city during that period. But how many of those jobs were the direct result of efforts of the Fung administration? We posed that question to Fung's chief of staff, Carlos Lopez. The city, it turns out, keeps its own count of added jobs. Cranston's spreadsheet lists 37 companies that, Lopez said, were actively helped by the city. By its count, those businesses added 1,209 jobs. ""Our criteria for this included a range of assistance, from a simple initial meeting with all of the required departments for easy, one-stop shopping, to actually guiding them along the permitting process all the way, to more complex things like having them take part of the revolving loan plan or providing them with tax incentive plans,"" said Lopez. ""These businesses all received actual assistance, not just ribbon cuttings or PR-related things."" We called some of those firms to double check the numbers. We got through to four top officials. All confirmed that the city provided assistance, even if precise estimates of the numbers of jobs created were off by a bit. Ernest G. Pullano, president of the restoration company Clean Care of New England, which went from Cranston to Warwick before returning to Cranston in 2011, said the Fung administration offered a ""tremendous amount"" of design, engineering and public works help. ""As far as being conducive to business, they were fantastic."" The city told PolitiFact that Cranston gained 25 jobs by the move. Pullano said about 10 workers were actually involved, but his work force has since grown to 40 or so. ""They may have asked me at the time what I thought the employee base would be. That sounds like a number I would have given them for the new facility,"" he said. David Levesque, founder of the local Brewed Awakenings CoffeeHouse chain, said the city's economic development office offered financing assistance (which Levesque didn't need) and helped by working to let the coffee shop use the huge sign on Pontiac Avenue near the junction of routes 95 and 37, a sign that once advertised a Sunoco station. The city says the project produced 25 jobs. Levesque said the actual count was about 35. And Carl Palermo, executive vice president for the Virginia-based surgical device company Cadence Inc., said city officials were hugely helpful when the company acquired a Smithfield firm with 80 employees and, needing more space, decided to renovate an existing building on Plainfield Pike. The guidance offered by the city ""saved us a lot of time and effort in terms of stumbling through the maze,"" said Palermo. ""That may sound insignificant, but when you're completely unfamiliar with a state, that's huge."" The city says 125 new jobs were created for Cranston there in 2009. Palermo said that wasn't correct then but it is now; 130 people work there. The fourth company official verified that jobs were created but didn’t want to be identified. It's also important to note two other things. In some of the cases, the businesses on the list were not necessarily new. Walmart expanded with 100 new jobs and Stop & Shop built a new store with an estimated 157 additional jobs. Those chains usually go and grow where the people are. In other cases, Cranston gained jobs because the city brought in companies originally located in other Rhode Island communities, which lost jobs as a result. Our ruling Allan Fung said his administration created more than 1,000 new jobs in the city. The city quickly produced a list of companies and an estimate of new jobs. When we spot-checked the list, business owners confirmed that they had received help from the city and the number of jobs was close to the city's tally. Although the evidence shows that Fung's administration deserves credit for helping them along, it was the businesses themselves that actually created the jobs. And all of this occurred as part of the recovery from a major recession. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Rep. Jim Renacci says raising the capital gains tax has lowered revenue, while cutting it has increased revenue
","
U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci says that any problem of government debt is ""not caused by a lack of revenue, it is our out of control federal spending.""

In a commentary he wrote for newspapers including the Wooster Daily Record, the 16th District Republican wrote:

""If you want further proof that raising taxes does not always produce the desired effect, look no further than the capital gains tax. ... history shows that raising taxes on investment income has actually lowered the revenue received from the tax, while cutting capital gains tax rates has increased revenue.""

He continued: ""Prior to the fiscal cliff deal, the last time capital gains taxes were raised was in 1987, and in the three years that followed, revenues from the tax declined an average of 12 percent. In contrast, when the rates were cut in 1981, 1997 and 2003, revenues on investment income increased from 15 percent to 25 percent in the three years period following the cuts.""

Renacci cited three sources in support of his statement that raising the tax rate on capital gains lowers tax receipts while cutting taxes raises money.

One, a commentary in Investor's Business Daily, cited the same years and figures he used, in more detail. The second, a commentary in the Wall Street Journal, asserts that, since 1978, ""the same pattern has repeated itself: raising the capital-gains rate reduces revenues, and lowering it leads to revenue increases.""

The third, a commentary from the Cato Institute in Investor's Business Daily, argues for ""moving toward a zero-tax regime for capital gains,"" and says the revenue loss from a tax cut or the gain from an increase would be small.

PolitiFact Ohio looked at capital gains rates and receipts, as tracked by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, and thought the history of increases and decreases was less clear-cut. We also could see that factors beyond tax rates influence tax receipts.

First, we should note that a capital gain is an increase in the value of assets such as stock or real estate. It becomes a form of income when it is realized -- when, in other words, the asset is sold at a profit.

Not all gains are subject to the tax. Most assets owned by households are not subject to the tax, and a gain from the sale of an owner-occupied home is typically not taxed.

About 90 percent of capital gains accruals go to households in the richest 20 percent of  households, according to the Congressional Research Service, and 70 percent go to the richest 5 percent.

Because capital gains are taxed only when an asset is sold, taxpayers have considerable control over when they pay their capital gains tax.

The tax rate did go up in 1987, as Renacci says, because of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But it is too simple and selective to say that revenues declined for the three years afterward.

The 1986 act was written so that the increase in the capital gains rate, from a maximum rate of 20 percent to a maximum of 28 percent, had an effective date of Jan. 1, 1987. That opened a window of opportunity for taxpayers to realize gains at the lower rate.

Those realizations, and the resulting tax revenues, were expected to increase in 1986, and they did. Tax revenues actually doubled the level of 1985, to an all-time high.

Realizations and revenues were expected to decline afterward, and they did. But tax receipts on capital gains in 1987, and the three years that followed, still were higher than they had been in 1985, before the rate increase.

The revenues were, in fact, the highest in history to that point except for the one-year window of 1986.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in a report on capital gains taxes and federal revenues, found the relationship between rates and revenues ""can be hard to detect and easy to confuse with other phenomena"" because of other influences on realizations.

""For example,"" the CBO said, ""a number of observers have attributed the rapid rise in realizations in the late 1990s to the 1997 cut in capital gains tax rates. But the 45 percent increase in realizations in 1996 -- before the cut -- exceeded the 40 percent and 25 percent increases in 1997 and 1998 that followed it. Careful studies have failed to agree on how responsive gains realizations are to changes in tax rates, with estimates of that responsiveness varying widely.""

Analysis from the business-oriented Committee for Economic Development noted that tax revenues increased after the 1997 tax cut -- coinciding with the high-tech stock market boom -- but fell precipitously with the 2001 recession.

""Revenues increased again after the 2003 tax cut, as the economy eventually recovered from the recession,"" it went on, ""but plunged again with the financial crisis of 2008.""

""From a political fact point of view,"" tax expert Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us, ""it's a matter of interpretation.""

The relationship between capital gains taxes and revenues has been studied extensively by economists, he said, and most studies find that higher rates reduce realizations of gains -- but that does not mean they cut revenues.

It’s a matter of simple math, Toder said: If revenue is going to go down when capital gains rates go up, the percentage drop in realizations must exceed the percentage increase in the tax rate.
There is little evidence that happens, he said, especially at today’s maximum 15 percent rate, which is lower than at any time since the Depression. (When he worked at CBO in 1988, Toder co-authored a paper that estimated that government revenues are maximized at a rate of between 25.6 percent and 32.3 percent.)

The CBO's 2002 study found that a cut in the capital gains rate will tend to spike tax revenues, but only temporarily. Rate cuts ""may not be enough to produce additional receipts over a long period,"" it concluded, but ""may do so over a few years.""

Similarly, the Congressional Research Service found in 2010 that ""changes in the tax rate or anticipated changes have coincided with large increases in capital gains realizations, but realizations quickly fell back to previous levels.

""While the effect of changes in the capital gains tax rate continue to be debated and researched,"" the CRS concluded, ""the bulk of the evidence suggests that reducing the capital gains tax rate reduces tax revenues.""

What can we conclude?

Renacci is correct that revenues do tend to increase following a cut in the rate -- but the spike is temporary, not a long-term phenomenon.

Higher rates generally reduce realizations of capital gains -- but that does not necessarily mean they cut revenues.

So the record is murkier on the other half of Renacci's statement, the corollary that raising rates decreases revenue. The one broad and widely applicable rate increase of the past 60 years, effective in 1987, led to a one-year spike in revenue followed by three years of revenues that were actually higher than those before the rate hike.

We rate his statement Half True.

"['Economy', 'Sports', 'Florida', 'Ron Book']","
Dolphins lobbyist says Super Bowl L is a '$500 million economic impact' to Florida
","The Miami Dolphins are seeking tax break subsidies to help pay for a $400 million stadium renovation.

Project supporters hope that such a massive investment will lead to more Super Bowls in the future. South Florida is competing with San Francisco to host the 50th anniversary Super Bowl in 2016. The NFL will announce the winner in May.

Stadium supporters told a state Senate committee March 6 that the public will reap benefits from the big bucks that come from a Super Bowl.

""A single Super Bowl generates over $300 million in economic benefits to South Florida and its businesses,"" said Sen. Oscar Braynon, a Democrat who represents Miami Gardens, where the Sun Life stadium is located.

Long-time Dolphins lobbyist Ron Book upped the ante:

""Super Bowl L by everybody's estimation is a $500 million economic impact to the state of Florida,"" Book said.

That’s a pretty strong claim that ""everybody"" estimates a half-billion impact from a single Super Bowl. Is there widespread agreement on that number?

The Dolphins are seeking about $200 million in public financing for about half the cost of a major stadium renovation. It would include state sales tax rebates and an increase in the Miami mainland hotel bed tax from 6 to 7 percent. County voters would have to approve the hotel bed tax increase.

The bill has received favorable votes in committees but faces an uphill public relations battle: A recent poll showed 73 percent of county voters are against the financing plan.

Legislators will make a decision based on the backdrop of another much criticized deal for a Miami team: In 2009, Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami partnered with the Marlins baseball team for a $634 million stadium/parking complex. Since opening in 2012, that stadium has had sluggish attendance and failed to revitalize the neighborhood. And it had political consequences: It helped lead to the recall of Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez.

Book points to study by host committee

Book pointed us to a study -- commissioned by the Super Bowl Host Committee -- about the 2007 Super Bowl in South Florida done by Sports Management Research Institute, whose clients include the NFL and other major sports entities. Total economic impact to South Florida: $463 million.

""I cannot share all of the information that we have as to the NFL’s plans for Super Bowl L,"" Book wrote in an email to PolitiFact Florida. ""You must just accept that everybody in the country that wanted the opportunity to bid for Super Bowl L believes it’s a $500 million-plus economic impact to host that game.""

The 2007 Super Bowl drew about 75,000 visitors to watch the Indianapolis Colts defeat the Chicago Bears 29-17. The study Book cited examined spending on hotels, restaurants, transportation, entertainment, retail and other services during the game day and associated events.

Researchers collected data from about 3,000 visitors at airports and a half-dozen hotels -- including some lavish spots such as The Breakers in Palm Beach County. Researchers also examined other economic impact studies, hotel occupancy, surveyed businesses and other information.

The study concluded that direct economic impact from spending was about $298 million. Then it added in the spending to prepare for the Super Bowl and the induced spending from new money flowing through the area, and the total came to $463 million. The biggest winner was Miami-Dade County, followed by Broward, and then neighboring Palm Beach and Monroe counties.

The study did not subtract out the normal tourist spending that would have happened during the period without a Super Bowl.

""We track whatever was spent by the Super Bowl fan. Period,"" Kathleen Davis, president of the firm that did the study, told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. Davis has also taught sports management at multiple universities -- and she has been to 11 Super Bowls.

While South Florida is already a tourist mecca in the winter even without a Super Bowl, these visitors were richer -- with an average household income of about $220,000 a year -- and spent more, the study concluded. Attendees spent more than four times the typical Broward County visitor and nearly three times that of a Miami-Dade visitor. They stayed an average of five nights and spent about $668 per day.

The same firm did a study of the 2010 Super Bowl in South Florida and concluded it was $333 million amid the economic downturn.

Experts say studies inflate benefits of Super Bowl

There is no dispute that a Super Bowl in South Florida draws some high-rollers who rent limos, wine and dine at our best restaurants and clubs, hit the shops at tony malls and book luxurious hotel suites in South Beach, Coral Gables, Fort Lauderdale and other cities. Businesses that cater to these tourists can rake in some hefty profits.

""The Super Bowl is a magic event,"" said Broward tourism chief Nicki Grossman, who says direct spending for the 2007 Super Bowl was about $65 million in Broward County. Super Bowl visitors ""buy things normally any other traveler wouldn’t. Some spend more to say they spend more.""

Studies by the National Football League or the host committee often peg the impact anywhere between $300 million and $600 million, depending on the analysis. A study about the 2008 Arizona Super Bowl -- coordinated in part by a business professor who served on the Host Committee -- concluded a $500 million impact. A study examining the 2009 Super Bowl in Tampa said it resulted in spending totaling $375 million.

We didn’t find a study predicting the economic impact of the 2016 Super Bowl in South Florida -- the 2007 study doesn’t actually predict the impact for 2016. (Economists often look at the impact after the event.) But many independent economists say the benefit is much lower than boosters’ totals.

These economists share a joke: take the boosters’ estimates and move the decimal place one point to the left. Economists say boosters dangle the enormous revenue figures as politicians are weighing whether to support public funding.

Holy Cross Economics Professor Victor Matheson, together with Professor Robert Baade, wrote in a 2004 paper that for Super Bowls held between 1970 and 2001, the host city experienced an average increase in personal income of about $92 million and that the game could not have contributed more than $300 million. In today’s numbers, the $92 million means $120 million and the $300 million would equal just under $400 million, Matheson told PolitiFact Florida.

""Not only is our best guess a fraction of the boosters' estimates, but we are also quite certain that any estimate over $300 million is flat-out wrong,"" he said.

We asked Matheson if Miami would warrant going with the higher figure rather than the average.

""Miami might be slightly better off than some other cities since it has more hotel rooms than most other Super Bowl host cities allowing for more visitors before capacity constraints are hit,"" Matheson wrote in an email. ""On the other hand, as a big warm weather destination, it has rather large numbers of tourists anyway during late January, early February that will be crowded out by Super Bowl fans. Overall, I would expect the economic impact in Miami to be typical of the average host city.""

Studies by boosters often take the number of attendees and multiply that by expenditures to arrive at a gross direct spending total. Then they use a multiplier to calculate an indirect effect of those initial expenditures circulating around the economy. Matheson told us, ""Economic consultants seem to be pretty good at adding and multiplying, but not so good at subtracting.""

Economists say boosters ignore some factors that affect the bottom line, which they call the substitution effect, the crowding out effect, and leakages.

Substitution is when someone spends money on the Super Bowl that they would have spent elsewhere in the economy. Since an event such as the Super Bowl draws so many out-of-town visitors, the substitution effect is far less than from a regular game.

Crowding refers to other visitors deciding to stay away from the area to avoid the congestion, resulting in the loss of spending from those folks. That means if hotels are largely full anyway, economists focus on the net effect from the increased bookings (and inflated costs) -- not the total revenues of hotels. (During the 2007 Super Bowl, attendance at Monkey Jungle, a south Miami-Dade tourist attraction, plummeted.)

And leakages occur when money spent on chain hotels and restaurants leak back to corporate headquarters -- not the local economy.

""The local employees changing sheets or running room service, they don’t get 10 times their wage that week,"" said Professor Craig Depken, an economist at the University of North Carolina.

Some economic models used to calculate economic benefits do account for leakage. But Matheson wrote that those models calculate leakage based ""on the normal inter-industry relationships that exist in local economies, and during a mega-event these relationships may be anything but normal.""

PricewaterhouseCoopers has estimated the economic impact of multiple Super Bowls. According to its analysis, direct visitor spending has ranged from a low of close to $120 million in Detroit in 2006, to high of about $200 million in Dallas/Fort Worth in 2011. The firm (which wasn’t paid by the Host Committee) projected $185 million in economic impact for the New Orleans Super Bowl held earlier this year.

Dolphins spokesman Eric Jotkoff said that Book took the $463 million in the 2007 study and cited a $500 million in 2016 as a result of inflation and increased spending because ""Super Bowl L promises to be the biggest Super Bowl in the game’s history.""

Our ruling

Lobbyist Ron Book said ""Super Bowl L by everybody's estimation is a $500 million economic impact to the state of Florida.""

First, Book uses numbers from a study commissioned by the Host Committee. The numbers take a broad measure of all spending that went on during a Super Bowl week in 2007, without accounting for usual economic activity. In fact, it’s among the highest estimates we reviewed for economic activity generated by a Super Bowl.

But the main problem with Book’s claim is that ""everybody"" agrees on that number.

Economics professors argue that studies by boosters routinely inflate costs and fail to take into account net costs or fully account for the fact that some spending locally is sent to corporate chains.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Virginia Foxx']","
Rep. Virginia Foxx warns of mismatch between skills, available jobs
","
Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., recently took to the House floor to tout a bill she’s sponsoring that would change the structure of job training programs. She warned that the economy faces a paradox -- despite historically high unemployment rates, many jobs are going vacant.

""There are 3.6 million jobs sitting vacant, in part because there aren’t enough qualified applicants to fill them,"" Foxx said in the March 12, 2013, speech.

To check Foxx’s claim, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s scorekeeper on employment data.

We easily found the source of her 3.6 million figure. It comes from a monthly survey called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. The most recent seasonally adjusted data at the time of Foxx’s speech covered January 2013. It showed that there were just under 3.7 million job openings in January, which was up slightly from 3.6 million in December 2012.

So Foxx essentially got the number right. However, her use of the term ""sitting vacant"" and her warning about a ""shortage of qualified applicants"" suggests that employers are having trouble filling these 3.6 million jobs. A close look at the survey reveals it doesn’t actually support that thesis.

The bureau’s official definition of a ""job opening"" is ""a specific position of employment to be filled at an establishment"" that satisfy these conditions: ""there is work available for that position, the job could start within 30 days, and the employer is actively recruiting for the position.""

But there are always job openings -- even in a healthy economy. In a phenomenon known as ""churn,"" people change jobs. Just because their old job is unoccupied when the BLS takes its monthly data snapshot doesn’t necessarily mean that the employer is having trouble filling the job. Rather, the employer could simply be going through the process of hiring, with the job filled a month later.

The data from this survey  ""has important limitations,"" said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, because it ""provides little information about the distribution of vacancy durations"" and ""no direct information about the reason why some job openings take a long time to fill.""

In some ways, vacancies are actually a hallmark of a healthy economy. Job openings often arise either because someone leaves one job for a better one, or because a company is hiring new workers. Both are positive signs. If you look at the monthly December job opening totals going back a decade, the years just prior to the recession had the most job openings, while the years during and immediately after the recession hit had the least job vacancies:

2012: 3.6 million
2011: 3.5 million
2010: 2.9 million
2009: 2.5 million
2008: 3.2 million
2007: 4.0 million
2006: 4.4 million
2005: 3.9 million
2004: 3.5 million
2003: 2.9 million

But while the number Foxx used doesn’t provide much support for her claim, other evidence, both anecdotal and statistical, suggests that she has a point that there’s a problem with unfilled jobs today.

The most solid evidence for a lengthening of job vacancies comes from a study by Davis,  R. Jason Faberman and John C. Haltiwanger. It found that the time before a vacancy is filled has expanded from 15 days in 2009 to 23 today. As a result, the job vacancy rate and the unemployment rate, which historically have moved in tandem, began to diverge during the most recent recession and have not yet returned to their historical pattern.

Why is this happening? Foxx’s office provided links to a variety of news reports that suggest a mismatch between applicants’ job skills and the ones employers are seeking. Economists agree that that is part of the issue, particularly with high-skill jobs. But it’s probably not the only reason.

For instance, there appears to be a ""hiring paralysis"" among employers who are acting with unusual caution because they are uncertain whether the economy will remain strong rather than stagnating, according to economists and hiring professionals quoted in the New York Times earlier this year. This has sometimes led to employers piling on extra tests and rounds of interviews as a way of stalling, experts told the Times.

Our ruling

Foxx said, ""There are 3.6 million jobs sitting vacant, in part because there aren’t enough qualified applicants to fill them."" She’s right that there are 3.6 million vacancies and she's right that there aren't enough qualified job applicants, but she wrong to link the two because that statistic doesn’t take into account how long a job has been open. Still, there is strong evidence that the duration of job vacancies has grown since the onset of the most recent recession, and the skills mismatch Foxx cites is likely part of the reason. We rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/14/virginia-foxx/rep-virginia-foxx-warns-mismatch-between-skills-av/

Ohio GOP Chairman Bob Bennett says the party enjoyed important victories under Chris McNulty
","
After the Republican National Committee hired Vermilion native Chris McNulty as its political director last week, Ohio GOP Chairman Bob Bennett toasted the rise of a native son. 
In an emailed statement, Bennett praised McNulty as ""an extraordinary political mind and a skilled strategist,"" then reflected on the longtime operative’s work at the state party. 
""Ohio Republicans made significant gains during his time at the ORP, including the extremely successful re-election of President Bush in Ohio,"" Bennett said. ""I know he’ll serve the same energy and enthusiasm that he’s put forth throughout his entire political career."" 
Bush’s Ohio victory in 2004 clinched his second term and has been well-documented. But what about the other gains Bennett referenced? PolitiFact Ohio always appreciates a chance to look back at recent history, so we decided to review McNulty’s entire tenure at the Ohio GOP. 
According to the RNC, McNulty joined the state party in 1995 as field representative covering Northeast and Southeast Ohio. He became political director in 1997 and executive director in 2001. He served in the latter post through 2006, then moved on to the national scene. 
Republicans swept Democrats out of statewide office in 1990, gaining control of the powerful Apportionment Board and setting up an era of dominance in Columbus. Their hold on the board allowed them to draw legislative districts for General Assembly, which approves congressional boundaries. The GOP had ruled the Ohio Senate since 1985 and captured the House in 1994. 
Recounting these events is important, as they all occurred prior to McNulty’s arrival. He joined the Ohio Republican Party at a time of great strength. We narrowed in specifically on the decade in which McNulty held the key positions of political director and executive director. 
The most significant accomplishments during that period are the party’s exclusive lock on nonjudicial statewide posts in the 1998 and 2002 elections and control of the General Assembly through 2008. This essentially kept the power of the redistricting pen with Republicans. 
In 2000, after Republican George W. Bush won Ohio’s electoral votes in his bid for the White House, McNulty was part of the team sent to Florida to oversee the recount there. 
Two years later, under new congressional lines, the party picked up a seat while Democrats lost two. (Because of population trends, Ohio’s delegation shrunk from 19 to 18 seats that year.) 
All of these achievements came during McNulty’s time at the Ohio GOP. It is fair to say that under his leadership, the party capitalized on previous gains and enjoyed new ones. 
But McNulty’s story doesn’t end in 2004. He served as executive director through 2006. That was the year Democrats won all but one of the statewide administrative offices and unseated Republican U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine. Coincidentally, McNulty briefly was a primary candidate for state auditor, serving as a placeholder until questions about Mary Taylor’s petitions were resolved. As it turned out, Taylor was the lone bright spot for the GOP that November. 
Republicans also lost a congressional seat that year. Democrat Zack Space won the battle to replace Republican Rep. Bob Ney, who stepped aside amid corruption charges. 
The Associated Press caught up with McNulty on Jan. 8, 2007, as Taylor was sworn into office and reported that the reality of the defeat had begun to sink in for the executive director. 
""On Election Night, you’re tired,"" McNulty told the AP. ""Today, I’m wide awake. It’s real."" 
Just as it’s unfair to credit one individual for all the party’s successes, it’s unfair to place all the blame for 2006 at McNulty’s feet. With Bush unpopular, the midterm elections represented a wave for Democrats nationally. And Ney’s legal troubles clearly hurt Republicans in that district. 
Bennett said the state party ""made significant gains"" while McNulty was there. There is no question that this was true between 1997 and 2004. However, Bennett’s statement does not take into account the significant Republican losses in 2006, McNulty’s last year in the Buckeye State. 
PolitiFact Ohio is not claiming the losses were McNulty’s fault. We’re not claiming the bad outweighs the good. But the fact that the party was in a weaker position when he left than it was when he arrived is an important clarification. 
So on the Truth-O-Meter, Bennett’s statement rates Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2013/mar/13/bob-bennett/ohio-gop-chairman-bob-bennett-says-party-enjoyed-i/

Nancy Pelosi says 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women
","
On news of the stock market hitting an all-time high, U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it’s time to raise the minimum wage.

In a news conference on March 7, 2013, Pelosi, D-Calif., announced her support for a bill raising the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour.

""If we are to honor our commitment to a middle class, which is the backbone of our democracy, we have to reflect ... that intention in our public policy,"" she said.

Then she added, ""It is important to note in this Women's History Month, that more than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women. So this has a big impact on the financial security of our women.""

A reader asked us on Facebook about the statistic -- that nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage earners are women. We thought it was an interesting fact to check, and it turns out Pelosi is right.

The best source for this information is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey.

BLS figures show there were slightly more than 3.5 million men and women earning minimum wage or less in 2012, and nearly 2.3 million women at those wage levels. So dividing the total by the women workers gets you to 64.4 percent.

It’s interesting to note, however, that people earning the minimum wage account for a very small percentage of people working --  in this case, 2.6 percent of working women.

Our ruling

Pelosi said 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women.

Government figures from 2012, which are based on census data, back up her assertion. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-64-percent-minimum-wage-earners-/

Ed Fallone says majority of his contributions in Supreme Court race have been from private people, not groups
","
In his bid to unseat Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Pat Roggensack, challenger Ed Fallone is embracing the underdog role.

That, he said, shows up in his campaign contributions.

""We don’t have deep pockets,"" Fallone told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors March 6, 2013. ""I am very proud of the fact that, through my first campaign finance report, the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals, not from PACs, not from groups.""

Fallone, a Marquette University law professor making his first bid for office,  said ""the average size of my contributions to date has been $125.""

Roggensack, considered part of the court’s conservative wing, did dominate the fundraising game before the Feb. 19, 2013, primary. She raised nearly three times Fallone’s total from Jan. 1 to Feb. 4 of 2013, though the amounts were modest for a statewide race, the Journal Sentinel reported.

The two face off in the April 2, 2013, election.

Let’s examine Fallone’s assertion that ""the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals"" giving $125 on average, ""not from PACs, not from groups.""

The money trail

Fallone reported raising about $75,000 for the period. His two largest campaign gifts came from political action committees (PACs) organized by unions representing Madison teachers (the maximum $8,625 donation) and other public employees ($8,500). The third biggest, an individual donation from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, was $5,000.

In all, Fallone’s four PAC contributions made up about 24 percent of his receipts, roughly $18,000. Donors who gave as individuals made up more than three-fourths of his cash gifts.

Looked at another way, by the number of donors, all but a handful of his 500 givers were individuals, not PACs.

So the guts of Fallone’s claim is on target.

To be sure, Roggensack can make the same claim; less than 5 percent of her pre-primary donations came from PACs that included two county-level Republican Party units, the Milwaukee Police union, bankers, builders and utilities. She raised about $202,000 in 2013 before the primary.

Case closed?

Not entirely.

In his claim, Fallone said ""PACs"" and ""groups."" And there is a nuance here that alters the picture a bit.

About one-sixth of Fallone’s money was given by individuals, but bundled up by special-interest groups and sent to the candidate in one check from the group. These are known as ""conduit"" donations. The approach allows corporations, unions and other groups to present larger checks to candidates than they could under the rules for PACs.

By state law, the donors are publicly disclosed and listed as individual donors on campaign finance reports. And in media accounts they are typically counted as individual donors. So Fallone has cause to count them that way.

But they are not just individual donors.

In Fallone’s case, Wisconsin trial lawyers banded together as the ""Justice Fund"" conduit, and education union employees in the United Staff Union, combined to make up 71 of his slightly more than 500 donors.

When those are combined with PAC contributions, they represent 41 percent of his total contributions. That’s a far bigger amount than PACs alone.

However, even if you count the conduit bucks as group gifts, individuals still make up almost 60 percent of Fallone’s donations. And his claim was simply they made up a majority.

For her part, Roggensack received a small number of conduit donations, most notably from the Fund for Parent Choice, whose backers support the school voucher program.

As for the average size of the donations from individuals, Fallone said it was $125. Our calculation came up with $114.

So he’s a bit high, but on the right side considering his point is the modest amounts of his typical gifts.

Of course, third-party interest groups are allowed to spend independently on behalf of the Supreme Court candidates. Those amounts are reported separately from the candidate’s campaign funds and they are not supposed to coordinate their campaign efforts with the candidates.

Before the primary, two union-funded groups spent modestly on campaign literature in support of Fallone. The Wisconsin Club for Growth spent on behalf of Roggensack’s campaign.

Our rating

Fallone said ""the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals"" giving $125 on average, ""not from PACs, not from groups.""

Not all private individuals are created equal, we found, but Fallone’s analysis is reasonable, his numbers are on target and his claim about average gift size is slightly off but in his favor.

His statement is accurate with those clarifications. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/13/ed-fallone/ed-fallone-says-majority-his-contributions-supreme/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Donzella James']","
Gun law claim goes awry
","
PolitiFact Georgia is usually interested when an elected official claims the Peach State is first or worst in a particular category.

State Sen. Donzella James, a Democrat who represents portions of Douglas and Fulton counties, had us listening closely when she made a specific statement about guns and Georgia.

The lawmakers were discussing Senate Bill 101, which would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they’ve completed basic military training, as long as the person has not been dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless required by federal law or regulation. 

Senate Bill 101 passed by a 41-10 margin and is now in the hands of the House of Representatives. 

James had serious concerns about the bill and went into the well to speak in front of her colleagues.

""We know that Georgia has the most lax laws (for) carrying guns,"" said James, a self-described gun owner, who prefaced her remarks by saying she hadn’t planned to speak.

James was referring to Georgia’s gun laws in general, not just permits to carry firearms.

We wondered: Does Georgia have the most lax gun laws in America?

Some gun control organizations regularly rank each state based on its gun laws. The most prominent group, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, gave Georgia an 8 on a scale of 100 in terms of the toughness of its gun laws in 2011. Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Senate Democrats, sent us a link to that report. 

To clarify, 8 is not considered a good score as far as gun control advocates are concerned. Georgia received points for not allowing guns on college campuses, requiring a license, record-keeping and retention and police inspections. 

For those who are distressed by Georgia’s score, take comfort. Twenty-seven states received lower scores than Georgia that year. Alaska, Arizona and Utah received not one point. In 2009, the Brady Campaign also gave Georgia a score of 8. There were nearly 20 states that received a lower score.

The National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action has been unimpressed with the Brady rankings. It notes only a handful of states receive passing marks from Brady and say states that score high have higher crime rates. The NRA complains the Brady Campaign gives points to states with gun laws that supplement federal gun laws.

Another group, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, gave Georgia a D for the toughness of its gun control laws. Again, many states did far worse. Twenty states received a grade of F from the group. The center gives best practices for policies such as laws prohibiting gun dealers from residential areas, laws requiring a license to purchase ammunition and those that require gun safety training.

UCLA Law School professor Eugene Volokh, who has been writing and teaching about U.S. gun laws for several years, says it is difficult to completely determine which states have the most lax gun laws because there are so many ways to examine the claim. For example, he said, it can be examined by the types of weapons permitted in each state. Some criteria he prefers are examining how easy it is to carry a concealed gun or at what age you can get a permit.

Four states -- Alaska, Arizona, Vermont and Wyoming -- allow law-abiding adults to carry a concealed firearm without a permit, The Washington Post noted. The Post also reported that Vermont allows people as young as 16 to buy a handgun. Georgia laws are not as permissive, Volokh observed.

""Georgia is not the most gun-friendly state in the nation, but probably not the most hostile, either,"" Volokh said. 

So where does this all leave us? The senator said, ""We know that Georgia has the most lax laws (for) carrying guns."" 

From our review, Georgia is considered to have some lax gun laws. It’s possible from some of the changes proposed, Georgia could score lower in the future. But, for now, there are other states that are far more permissive.

Rand Paul says CIA Director John Brennan claimed no geographic limit on drone strikes
","
When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., staged his historic filibuster over 13 hours on March 6, 2013, he said he just wanted answers.

He wanted President Barack Obama’s administration to definitively say whether the use of armed drones could ever be justified on American soil. During his epic stand on the Senate floor, which only ended with the inevitable call of nature, Paul cited several statements made by administration officials that concerned him -- including one by CIA Director nominee John Brennan. 
""When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly, 'Is there any limit to your killing? Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?' Brennan responded and said, 'no, there is no limitation,'"" Paul said during the first hour of filibustering. 
Paul's issue was about the possibility of drone strikes in the United States. After his filibuster, Attorney General Eric Holder addressed Paul's concerns in a letter. Holder wrote that the president does not have the authority ""to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil."" 
In looking over Paul's statements during the filibuster, we wondered: Did Paul accurately characterize Brennan’s answer about geographic limitations to drone use in the global terror fight? Did Brennan say there was ""no geographic limitation?"" 
We reached out to Paul’s office but did not hear back. Still, we found three instances of Brennan addressing that issue.

In a speech in April 2012 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Brennan -- acknowledging the administration’s drone program for the first time publicly -- said drone strikes could be necessary outside of the battlefield. At the time he was Obama’s point person on counterterrorism strategy.

""There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat,"" he said.

In February 2013, ahead of hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to confirm him as CIA director, Brennan reiterated that belief in response to written questions.

Question: ""Would you support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of ‘hot’ battlefields and codify the standards for the conduct of targeted strikes, including through the use of remotely piloted aircraft? Why or why not?""

Brennan replied: ""On your question about whether I would support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of ‘hot’ battlefields, I believe we currently have the authority to take action in such circumstances against al-Qaida and associated forces. As Jeh Johnson, the former General Counsel of the Department of Defense, indicated in a lecture at Yale Law School in February of last year, the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force does not contain a geographical limitation. Consequently I do not believe additional legislation along these lines is necessary.""

And in more written questions after his confirmation hearing, Brennan was again asked about ""geographical limits"" on the administration’s drone strikes.

He noted, in part, ""the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, ‘neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.’""
   
But he went on to say: ""This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nation’s sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States.""

We ran this issue by Paul Pillar, a former CIA official who now teaches at Georgetown University. He responded: ""Sen. Paul's comment is a generally correct characterization of Brennan's answer regarding the absence of any geographic limitation on the administration's authority to conduct strikes. Brennan's further remark about other considerations coming into play is a way of saying that the administration does not wantonly conduct strikes around the world, but those considerations do not constitute a ‘geographic limitation.’""

 Our ruling

Paul said during the filibuster, ""When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly, … ‘Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?’ Brennan responded and said, ‘no, there is no limitation.’""

We found three instances when Brennan cited legal opinion asserting no geographic limit on where the United States can use drones against terrorists. He did add that the absence of a geographic limit does not mean drones can be used ""whenever or wherever"" -- that international legal principles still apply. But we agree with Pillar that that addendum doesn’t amount to a geographic limitation.

Paul’s characterization of Brennan’s comments is accurate. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/12/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-cia-director-john-brennan-claimed-n/
"['New Hampshire', 'Taxes', 'New Hampshire Democratic Party']","
NH GOP chairman Horn under fire for unpaid taxes
","
Tax Day -- April 15 -- is still more than a month away, but taxes-- and who has been late to pay them--already have been a popular topic this political season.

Initially, reports surfaced that Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster, a New Hampshire Democrat, owed nearly $11,000 in late property taxes on her home in Hopkinton and a vacation house in the White Mountains. (Kuster paid the delinquent bills soon after). And now state Democratic leaders are taking aim at Jennifer Horn, chairwoman of the state Republican Party, for her own tax troubles.

""Jennifer Horn has embarrassed herself once again,"" Ray Buckley, chairman of the N.H. Democratic Party, said in a statement issued Tuesday, March 5, 2013.

""I would ask her to check her math,"" Buckley said, regarding Horn’s criticism of Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan’s budget proposal. ""But, with $92,000 due in back taxes, I can’t believe that would help.""

Since she took over as party chairwoman in January, Horn has been a vocal critic of Kuster and her late property taxes. ""The time has come for Congresswoman Kuster to stop hiding from her constituents and offer an open and straightforward explanation about her long history of delinquent taxes,"" Horn said in a February statement.

But to what extent does Horn have tax issues of her own? This sounds like a job for PolitiFact.

In his claim, Buckley doesn’t specify which taxes Horn allegedly has failed to pay. So, we started by checking on her property taxes. Local records show Horn and her husband William are up to date on their property taxes on their Nashua, N.H. home, valued at $590,500, according to city assessment records.

During her run to become the head of the state Republican Party, a copy of an IRS tax lien on Horn’s home surfaced amid questions about her ability to raise funds for the party. Horn acknowledged tax problems, but panned the criticism as personal attacks against her and her family.

An IRS tax lien is on file at the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds, which maintains property records for the state’s southern tier. When the IRS issues a lien, it generates a public document intended to alert creditors that the government has a legal right to the property in question.

The lien, filed July 20, 2011, shows unpaid balances of $30,541 in 2008 and $61,642 in 2009.

Together, the $92,184 total matches Buckley’s claim. But, IRS officials are quick to note that tally does not necessarily reflect the most recent numbers.

The federal tax documents don’t reflect any payments made since the lien was issued, according to Peggy Riley, an IRS spokeswoman, and the IRS does not release individual tax records beyond the lien, Riley said.

""We file the lien, then we don’t do anything with it until it is totally paid off,"" she said.

Reached for comment, Horn declined to say whether she has paid down the tax lien. But, she did address the difficulties her family has faced.

""I have been honest about the struggles that my family faced after my husband lost his job, and we stepped up on our own to pay our obligations,"" Horn wrote in an email to The Telegraph.

Our ruling:

Federal tax documents, kept by the county registry of deeds, support Buckley’s claim that Horn owes $92,000 in back taxes -- or at least she did 20 months ago.

The tax lien, issued by the IRS in July 2011, reflects the amount Horn and her husband owed at that time, but it does not consider any payments they may have made since then.

The lien is still active, which means Horn still owes some amount, but because the IRS does not disclose more recent tax information, it is impossible to tell how much Horn owes at this time.

With that in mind, we rate Buckley’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/12/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-gop-chairman-horn-under-fire-unpaid-taxes/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Cantor says job longevity has decreased during last 20 years
","
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, says Republicans must find ways to reduce economic insecurity in American families.

""Over the last 20 years, the world has changed,"" he said during a Feb. 5 speech to the American Enterprise Institute. ""It used to be that one could make a career out of working for one company. Today, the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years.""

It’s a common refrain that people don’t stay at jobs as long as they used to and we wondered whether it’s true. Checking Cantor’s statement required two determinations: 1) How long does the average worker of today keep a job and, 2) Has the duration become shorter in the last 20 years?

Cantor’s staff directed us to numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The agency collects tenure data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which asks a sample of workers how long they have been with their current employer. The figures reflect the median responses, meaning that half of the workers have been with their employers a shorter time and half longer.

Since 1996, the BLS has published tenure statistics every other year. Immediately before then, it was published every five years. So it’s impossible to find data that neatly compares the 20-year span Cantor referenced. But the figures do allow a 21-year comparison, from January 1991 to January 2012, the date of the last report.

The median tenure for U.S. workers in 2012 was 4.6 years, longer than the 3.6 years recorded in 1991. So contrary to Cantor’s contention, the length of time employees stayed with companies increased.   

The problem with this data is that it includes all workers, starting at age 16.

""Those people are in school, starting out doing part-time work and may have a first job in retail,"" said Craig Copeland, a senior research associate for the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. ""When we get to 25, we’re seeing people who are starting their career … that’s the age where people begin to have a strong workforce attachment.""

In an article he wrote for the institute’s newsletter, Copeland singled out the figure for all workers 25 or older. The median tenure was 4.8 years in 1991 and 5.4 years in 2012. By this measure, too, the length of time employees stayed with companies increased.

Copeland’s analysis of the data goes back to 1983, when workers 25 or older had a median tenure of 5.0 years with the same company. He noted that tenure figures sway with the economy, falling during boom years when companies are hiring and rising during tight years when workers have fewer job options.

The 5.4-year median tenure for workers 25 and older in January 2012 was the highest recorded in BLS reports dating back to 1983.

The increase over the last 21 years has been driven by women. In 1991, women 25 and older spent a median 4.3 years with the same company. That rose to 4.4 years in in 1992 and 5.4 years in 2012.

There hasn’t been a sustained change for similarly aged men. They spent a median 5.4 years working for the same company in 1991, 4.9 years in 2002 and 5.5 years in 2012.

Putting all the numbers together, Copeland wrote, ""Overall, employee tenure has been remarkably stable since 1983.""

He also noted that the number the number of workers staying in what could be considered career jobs has slowly increased. In 1983, 8.9 percent of workers had been with the same company 20 years or more. That rose to 9.5 percent in 1991, and 11 percent in 2012.

Robert Topel, a University of Chicago labor economist, told us in an email that the median tenure statistics Cantor referred to are an imperfect measure of workers’ longevity with employers. The problem, he said, is that it records workers during the middle of employment stints that could last much longer.  ""The average completed duration of jobs in progress is roughly double the mean,"" he wrote.

Topel said that in measuring worker longevity, ""career jobs are pretty important and not materially different from the past.""

The BLS figures show that in 1991, 32.2 percent of workers 25 or older worked for the same company for 10 years or more. That increased to 33.7 percent in 2012.

In 1991 and 2012, slightly more than half of full time workers 55 or older had been with the same company for 10 years or longer.

Our ruling

Cantor said job longevity has diminished over the last 20 years. ""It used to be that one could make a career out of working for one company,"" he said. ""Today, the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years.""

The majority leader was referring to 2012 BLS figures that show the median length of time U.S. workers 16 and older had spent with their employer was 4.6 years. The problem with this statistic is that young workers don’t stay at jobs very long and don’t view their labor as careers. The mean tenure of workers 25 and older was 5.4 years.

In either case, tenure has actually increased over the last two decades. It has actually risen by one year if we consider workers 16 and older, and by more than half a year if we consider workers 25 and older.

The bottom line: There’s some accuracy in Cantor’s estimate of how many years workers stay at their jobs. But he’s off target on his his major point -- that longevity at companies has decreased over the last 20 years. All told, we rate Cantor’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/12/eric-cantor/cantor-says-job-longevity-has-decreased-during-las/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Nan Orrock']","
Lawmaker uses polls to make case against Georgia gun bill
","
Some gun-control advocates use as part of their arsenal in the national debate on this issue that most Americans support their effort, including background checks.

Georgia state Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, made a specific claim about public support for such checks during a floor debate about Senate Bill 101, which she feared would expand access to guns.

""More than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks,"" Orrock said.

SB 101 would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they’ve completed basic military training, as long as they were not dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless a ban is required by federal law or regulation. It passed the Senate by a 41-10 vote and is being reviewed by the state House of Representatives.

PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some checking to see whether the senator is correct or is she exaggerating public support for such guidelines.

After the December shootings of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., President Barack Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of coming up with legislation to stem such violence. In January, Obama announced a series of proposals that includes background checks for all gun sales.

Federal law currently requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers to do such background checks. A handful of states (Georgia is not one of them) require private dealers to conduct background checks. Gun control advocates want to require private dealers to conduct such a check, which is commonly known as a ""universal background check.""

Several Democrats, including Obama, have said about 40 percent of all guns are sold without a background check. PolitiFact has reviewed this claim several times and noted it’s based on a 1997 study, rating it Half True.

Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the state Senate Democrats, sent us several polls she says support Orrock’s point.

Here’s a look at some of the polls Flowers sent us and some we found: 

There was a margin of error of about 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points in each poll.

Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington recently fact-checked a claim by Obama that ""overwhelming majorities of Americans"" support gun legislation ""like background checks."" PolitiFact noted some of the same polls we reviewed. PolitiFact concluded more than 80 percent of Americans support universal background checks. Obama’s claim, though, was rated Mostly True because his statement suggested strong support for other proposals by his administration, not just universal background checks.

To sum up, the senator said more than 80 percent of Americans support universal background checks on gun purchases. In each recent poll we reviewed, the public support for universal background checks was well above 80 percent.

Does Interstate 205 carry more traffic than Interstate 5?
","
Critics of a $3.4 billion plan to replace the current Interstate 5 bridge connecting Portland and Vancouver say that tolling the bridge will send drivers elsewhere -- spreading the rush hour gridlock around instead of solving it. Backers are relying on money from tolling to help pay for a new bridge.

That was the concern that Sen. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Portland, was channeling during a floor speech in opposition to House Bill 2800, which authorized the state to sell $450 million worth of bonds for the project, known as the Columbia River Crossing. The controversial bill has cleared both chambers and Gov. John Kitzhaber’s signature is expected Tuesday.

In her speech, Dingfelder said she worried that toll-wary travelers would seek out refuge on Interstate 205, using the Glenn Jackson Bridge to cross the Columbia.

""I-205, six miles of which runs through my district, already carries more traffic than I-5,"" Dingfelder said, so piling on more will hurt her neighborhood.

We snapped to attention at her assertion that I-205 carries more traffic. Has I-205, completed in 1983 as a bypass corridor for I-5 traffic, surpassed its older sibling with regards to traffic over the bridges?

We went to the Oregon Department of Transportation for the answer.

The agency tracks how many vehicles pass at certain points along all of its freeways. Those records show that in 2011, 123,900 ""average daily trips"" were recorded on I-5 at the Interstate Bridge. On I-205, 138,700 trips were recorded at the Glenn Jackson Bridge. The trips include both northbound and southbound.

So I-205 has 11 percent more traffic at the bridge. And we suppose that makes sense, since the Glenn Jackson Bridge is nearly twice as wide as the Interstate Bridge.

Ruling: 
We don’t know how many motorists would head over to I-205 to avoid a toll, but we do know that Dingfelder’s right. More cars already travel across the I-205 bridge than the I-5 bridge.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein says there's 'no regulation' of commercial drones
","So, the government can’t use a weaponized drone to strike down a U.S. citizen who’s ""not engaged in combat,"" says Attorney General Eric Holder.

But can paparazzi use camera-laden drones to violate Hollywood’s privacy?

U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein says so.

Feinstein, chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, chatted with Hardball host Chris Matthews the day after Sen. Rand Paul’s 13-hour filibuster over U.S. drone policy.

Paul was concerned about a March 4, 2013, letter from the attorney general that didn’t appear to rule out drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American soil. A new letter satisfied his curiosity.

But his March 6 ""drone rant,"" as the Wall Street Journal called it, raised criticism from lawmakers, including Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

On MSNBC, Matthews asked Feinstein: Was Rand ""playing to the paranoia in people""?

Feinstein replied that armed drones are a ""new technology"" and a ""very dangerous weapon,"" that she wants to keep out of the hands of other nations. Then she said:

""We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use. You can see drones some day hovering over the homes of Hollywood luminaries, violating privacy.

""This question has to be addressed. And we need rules of operation on the border, by police, by commercial use, and also by military and intelligence use.

""So this is now a work in progress. We are taking a look at it on the Intelligence Committee, trying to draft some legislation. The administration is looking at a rules playbook as to how these won't be used and how they will be used.""

About armed drones, we’ve heard plenty in recent days, thanks to Paul.

But Feinstein’s privacy claim caught our eye. Do ""we have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use""?

The FAA

We gave Feinstein’s office a day or two to explain her comments, but her staff didn’t offer an on-the-record response.

So we chatted with experts on drones, also known as ""unmanned aircraft systems,"" and read up on Federal Aviation Administration rules.

That’s right — there are FAA rules. Do they address ""commercial use"" of drones?

Yes.

The only way for folks who don’t work in government to get FAA approval to fly a drone in U.S. airspace is to get something called an ""experimental airworthiness certificate.""

And the FAA doesn’t give them out for commercial use.

""The FAA's rules — once you can find them — are pretty clear: You cannot use a drone for a commercial purpose without a permit,"" said Matt Waite, who founded the Drone Journalism Lab at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.

""And, the FAA has made it pretty clear that those permits are really only for research and development and in very limited circumstances,"" he added. ""So, it amounts to a total ban on commercial (use).""

Waite would know:  Students and faculty in his lab ""research the ethical, legal and regulatory issues involved in using pilotless aircraft to do journalism.""

And even he hasn’t yet been able to score an FAA certificate.

Full disclosure: Before Waite joined the University of Nebraska in 2011 to teach reporting and digital product development, he was an employee of the Tampa Bay Times who helped create PolitiFact.

The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a nonprofit group that represents members interested in promoting drone technology, also told us that Feinstein was mistaken.

""There are a number of regulations on commercial flights of unmanned systems,"" said Melanie Hinton, a spokeswoman for the group.

Not only that, Hinton said, but currently, that includes ""no commercial use.""

That looks to us like the opposite of what Feinstein said.

Still, Feinstein has a point about privacy, said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington and author of the article, ""The Drone as Privacy Catalyst.""

He notes federal privacy laws haven’t kept pace with drone technology, and that while the FAA currently bans commercial use of drones, Congress has asked for new regulations for civilian drones by 2015.

Lawmakers want to ""safely accelerate"" the use of such drones, according to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, a piece of legislation that Feinstein supported.

""In this respect, she is correct,"" Calo said.

Still, the agency has said it will address concerns about privacy as it develops a new regulatory framework. It’s just not yet clear whether the new rules will satisfy privacy advocates. That’s because it's still in the middle of rulemaking, and plans more public outreach.

The Electronic Privacy Information Center, for example, petitioned the FAA to take privacy into account as it drafts its rules. The FAA agreed, saying the month before Feinstein’s comment that it ""intends to address these issues through engagement and collaboration with the public."" But final privacy requirements are still under development.

Our ruling

Feinstein said, ""We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use."" Feinstein’s wrong: Not only does the FAA regulate the commercial use of drones, it actually bans it. Still, the landscape is changing. At Congress’ direction, the FAA is drafting new regulations. How those rules will address privacy concerns, it's too soon to tell. But it's inaccurate to say there’s ""no regulation."" We rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/11/dianne-feinstein/regulation-commercial-drones/

Dan Patrick says 100,000 are on waiting list to attend Texas charter schools
","
Texas needs more charter schools, according to state Sen. Dan Patrick, because there are ""100,000 families who are on the wait list.""

Actually, the Houston Republican gave the statistic a couple ways as he introduced legislation on that point Feb. 18, 2013, in a hearing of the Senate Education Committee, which he chairs. He first cited ""100,000 families,"" then a few minutes later said, ""155,000 students … are enrolled in charters; approximately, as I said, 101,000 are on the wait list."" His Feb. 18, 2013, press release about the bill said nearly 100,000 parents were on charter school waiting lists.

But 100,000 sounds like a lot of anybodies -- as Patrick indicated, that’s about two-thirds of charters’ actual enrollment. According to the state Sunset Commission, those 155,000 charter enrollees equal about 3 percent of Texas public school students.

Are the lists that long?

We didn’t field a response from Patrick spokesman Logan Spence, and Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us the state did not keep such numbers on charter schools, which receive public dollars but are privately managed and exempt from some education laws so they can try different approaches.

Culbertson referred us to the Texas Charter Schools Association, whose spokeswoman Tracy Young emailed us waiting-list counts and some background on Texas charter schools in general.

Young said that in August 2012, the association asked its members to report their waiting-list numbers, which totaled more than 101,000 students. Of about 175 charter licensees operating in Texas at the time, she said, 137 were members of the association; 67 of those responded to the survey.

Those 67 charter operators accounted for 87 percent of Texas charter school students in 2012 -- 134,532 out of the total 154,278 -- according to the association.

On a chart the group sent us, the 67 operators’ wait lists added up to 101,851 students.

Two operators accounted for more than half the wait-listed students: Harmony Public Schools reported 44,942 children on wait lists, and IDEA Public Schools/Idea Academy Inc. reported 12,920. 
15 largest waiting lists among TCSA members who responded to 2012 survey:

Operators were asked to remove duplications among their own campuses, Young said. For example, if a child were on wait lists for six campuses run by a single operator, that operator would count the child only once in its total. Young said her group confirmed that at least the operators with the largest lists had filtered out such duplicative entries.

But they did not, she said, have a way to ""de-duplicate"" children who might appear on more than one operator’s list. Under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the association could not collect students’ names and addresses, Young said, and school operators did not have a system to compare such individual data with each other.

Still, she said, ""We feel certain that it represents a good number of the students on waiting lists across the state.""

The association, which formed in 2008, last year sued the state to get public dollars for charter facilities and to allow more than 215 charter licenses in Texas. Charter school operators in 2012, according to an association fact sheet, ran 506 campuses educating 154,278 students.

Texas charter schools overall have grown steadily since their inception in 1995, as shown by two charts from an August 2012 study commissioned by the Texas Business and Education Coalition, which used education agency data:
  
Texas charter school enrollment, 1997-2011 
Number of Texas charter schools, 1997-2011 


Looking for other wait-list estimates, we found no current numbers. But we did spot two older reports from the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation that suggested waiting lists had grown along with enrollment in prior years.

The reports, from August 2008 and Dec. 9, 2009, used education agency data and the foundation’s own research on open-enrollment charter schools (the largest category) and university charter schools to estimate that in 2007-08 there were 16,810 children wait-listed (compared with 89,156 enrolled), and for 2008-09 there were 40,813 children wait-listed (compared with 102,903 enrolled).

Footnotes said that students could appear on more than one list, but also noted, ""Some charter schools do not keep a waiting list even though demand exceeds supply.""

A chart in the 2009 report broke down the wait-lists by region: 
 

  
Our ruling

Patrick said, variously, that 100,000 students, families or parents are waiting to get into Texas charter schools. The schools’ association says that’s a little lower than their estimate for students, and it’s plausible that families or parents could be trying to enroll more than one child apiece.

The association’s survey only got responses from 67 charter operators, but those operators represented 87 percent of all Texas charter students in 2012. Their reported waiting lists were 75 percent the size of their total enrollment (that is, for every four kids enrolled, another three were reportedly trying to get in). If that ratio held true for the charter operators teaching the other 13 percent of Texas’ charter students (19,746 children), there would have been 14,809 students on those wait lists, yielding a total for all charter operators of 116,659.

Then again, the association’s 101,851 wait-list head count could contain duplications, if students were trying to get into schools run by more than one charter operator.

"['Pensions', 'Florida', 'Will Weatherford']","
Will Weatherford says Florida's pension fund needs $500 million for next 29 years to stay 'afloat'
","
Florida’s retirement system is not sustainable or modern, House Speaker Will Weatherford warned on the opening day of the annual legislative session.

""This session, we will spend $500 million of general revenue just to shore up our pension fund,"" he said on March 5, 2013. ""That’s above and beyond what we contribute to state employees’ retirement. And it’s just the down payment. We’re going to have to keep writing that check of a half a billion dollars for the next 28 years to keep our so called ‘great pension system’ afloat.""

Weatherford is proposing an overhaul of the state’s retirement system during the 2013 legislative session. He wants the only option for new public employees to be the 401(k)-like investment plan, which is less popular than the pension plan. Doing so will keep the fund, recently valued at $132 billion, in good health for the long-term without burdening taxpayers, he says.

We thought it prudent to check out his claim about how much the Legislature needs to spend to ""shore up"" the pension fund. Is it really about to capsize?

The pension fund ain’t what it used to be

Fast facts about the pension plan: It’s the fifth largest in the country, with about 1 million current and retired participants. State government workers comprise only about 20 percent of active members, trailing school district employees (48 percent) and county employees (22 percent). About 1,000 different public agencies and groups participate.

The pension fund was in the black from 1998 to 2008, earning billions more in investment returns than what was needed to pay out retirement benefits to workers. Then the stock market went thud, and the fund’s surplus disappeared.

For the past four years, the pension fund assets have not been enough to cover what it would owe current and future beneficiaries if all retired at once. The gap between assets and liabilities has grown to $19.3 billion as of July 2012. (Nerd alert: the $19.3 billion shortfall is called the unfunded actuarial liability, or UAL.) The pension fund is 86.9 percent funded. 
Advocates of public workers, such as Democrats and labor unions, have honed in on that point to counter Weatherford’s argument that the fund is in financial jeopardy. They say it’s not realistic to think all current and future beneficiaries will somehow require retirement benefits at once.

They say Florida’s underfunded status is still above the national average of 75 percent and above the funding level widely considered healthy at 80 percent. Only Wisconsin’s retirement system is 100 percent funded, our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin found.

Still, the Legislature’s fiscal conservatives are focused on pension reform. In 2011, they passed a sweeping law requiring employees to contribute 3 percent of their pay for retirement benefits.

Fill the gap?

State lawmakers expect a small budget surplus this year, but it’s not going to be nearly enough to close the pension fund’s liability gap in one fell swoop.

To close the gap, actuaries and state economists have prescribed a payment plan that works kind of like a 30-year mortgage.

Experts have recommended the state spend $537 million in the 2013-14 budget on the unfunded liability. Of that, $448 million would come from general revenue, according to a three-year financial outlook prepared by the Legislative Office of Economic and Demographic Research. (The House revised the general revenue estimate to $497 million in December.) This is what Weatherford is talking about when he says the state needs to pay this much to ""shore up"" the fund.

So if the Legislature chooses to include the recommended amount to start plugging the pension hole in the budget -- and for the past three years, they did not -- it would be about $500 million this year.

Weatherford mentioned this was ""above and beyond"" what the state pays to the retirement fund for its employees. According to the Florida House, that is expected to be $296.5 million based on current contribution rates. Universities, state colleges and school boards will add another $650 million.

Preparing for the future

Will the state fork over a half-billion dollars for the next 28 years, as Weatherford says? The simple answer: We don’t really know.

The value of the pension fund shifts with market volatility. In 2007, it was valued at $136.3 billion. In 2009, it was $99.6 billion. At the end of 2012, it was $122.7 billion. In theory, the market could rebound and Florida could pay off its unfunded liability with extra earnings, as it did in the past.

As the market changes, the liability could shrink or inflate.

David Draine, a senior research analyst at the Pew Center for the States, said while it’s reasonable to tout projections for financing the unfunded liability, it’s helpful to also point out how much those projections could shift with the market.

Alan Stonecipher, director of Florida Retirement Security Coalition, which is comprised of union groups, said, ""To make an assumption 29 years out based on a snapshot of today doesn’t really hold water.""

Union representatives criticized Weatherford’s statement for leaving out a few key points about the pension’s growing unfunded liability. For one, Weatherford didn’t include how the Republican-led Legislature did little to address the unfunded liability over the last three years by not making full payments on it.

He also didn’t mention that when the pension was overfunded, lawmakers spent the surplus by reducing employer contribution rates and increasing benefits for special-risk employees. The pension fund would have been in a better position to weather the economic downturn had they not made those choices, Stonecipher said.

Stonecipher also took issue with Weatherford’s choice of words in describing the pension fund as needing to be kept ""afloat."" That makes it sound like the pension fund is on the brink of going under without this payment.

Putting off full payments on the pension fund's liability gap is a bit like people who pay only the minimum due on a credit card bill. ""It doesn’t immediately put you into insolvency or bankruptcy, but it does push that bill off into the future and ensures that when it does come due, the eventual payment will be even larger,"" Draine said.

Our ruling

Weatherford uses an accurate number to describe the cost of addressing the pension fund’s unfunded actuarial liability -- based on current estimates. But he loses points for holding this figure up as how much the state will affirmatively pay each year for the next 28 years. That’s based on predictions that could shift, for better or worse, depending in large part due to market performance. On that note, Weatherford’s comments on the need for big reform make no mention of the fact that the pension fund was in a surplus for the better part of the 21st century.

The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition of Half True.

Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn says use of assault weapons in crime dropped by two-thirds during assault weapon ban
","
Coming off his emotional congressional testimony backing legislation to renew a ban on military-style assault weapons, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn appeared on MSNBC.

Asked about criticism alleging that the previous ban had almost no impact on the nation’s homicide rate, Flynn cited studies on the ban done for the U.S. Department of Justice.

Researchers, said Flynn, found that ""over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two-thirds. ""

He added: ""Now, they couldn’t prove causation. Police implemented and embraced a wide variety of strategies and tactics during those 10 years as well. But it’s foolish not to see that there was a correlation. And to demand perfect social science causation proof before we can say that something had an impact on a phenomenon is foolish, it’s rhetorical and it doesn’t relate to the reality of policing.""

As Congress debates tightening gun controls after the Newtown school massacre, we thought it was worth checking Flynn’s assertion about assault-weapon use during the ban that began in 1994 and expired in 2004.

Did a study show a two-thirds drop off in use of assault weapons in crimes?

The claim is in wide circulation, having found its way into talking points that U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) offers for the renewal of the assault weapons ban. The National Rifle Association, which is fighting the ban, disputes the number.

At issue is a 2004 study, sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, an arm of the U.S. Justice Department. Its author, Christopher S. Koper, also did the federally sponsored report for Congress on the short term (1994-1996) effect of the ban.

Koper is a veteran criminology researcher, formerly of the Police Executive Research Forum. At the time of the 2004 study he was a professor affiliated with the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. He is now at the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University.

The 1994 ban was aimed at semiautomatics, including rifles and pistols, with features ""that appear useful in military and criminal applications but unnecessary in shooting sports or self-defense (examples include flash hiders, folding rifle stocks, and threaded barrels for attaching silencers),"" the study said.

Flynn and Feinstein point to a conclusion in Koper’s 2004 report that found a big decline in the percentage of assault weapons among the guns seized by law enforcement and sent to federal officials for tracing.

That percentage dropped by 70 percent between 1992-’03 and 2001-’02. That is, the percentage went from 5.4 percent to 1.6 percent of guns seized, the study found. The percentages are low because the guns are rarely used in gun crimes.

That 70 percent drop is the main evidence for the ""two-thirds"" claim.

There’s another piece of data from Koper’s study that suggests such a major decline. It’s the experience in Boston pre-ban (1991 to 1993) and post-ban (2000 to 2002). There, police saw a 72 percent drop in assault weapons among all guns recovered by police.

Let’s take a closer look at both.

""The overriding point is that we found consistent evidence across multiple national and local data sources that the use of (assault weapons) declined substantially during the ban years,"" Koper said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The apparent drop was mainly in assault pistols, not assault rifles.

In addition, Koper wrote, based on figures collected in six metro police department ""there were indications in the data that (assault weapons) were becoming increasingly rare over time.""

Koper, however, made clear that he did not try to come up with one definitive number that illustrated the decline in assault weapons seen in the data.

A reading of the study shows why. It cautions in great detail that data that shows a 70 percent decline nationally is not conclusive.

First, a large majority of guns recovered by police are not sent to federal authorities who trace the gun from its manufacture to sale. So those guns may not be representative of the types of firearms seized by police, the study noted.

In addition, the drop may be attributable ""in large part"" to changes in tracing practices, the study noted.

Still, Koper noted in the 2004 study that the dramatic decline started in the year of the ban.

Ultimately, he concluded that the trace data ""suggest"" an actual decline in use of assault weapons in crimes.

Koper told us the national tracing data ""may overstate the drop, but it's understandable that people cite that number since it's a national figure.""

He added: ""At any rate, there are lots of subtleties in this and no one right answer.""

The National Rifle Association critique of the Flynn-Feinstein claim is that ""traces are not synonymous with crimes.""

The study acknowledges that, but cites a variety of reasons why guns recovered by police should serve as a ""good approximation"" of the types of guns used in violent crime, even though many are not clearly linked to such crimes.

When we asked Flynn about this, Police Inspector WilliamJessupwrote back saying: ""While there are limitations with any type of data, Chief Flynn does consider the 70 percent drop in ATF traces on assault weapons to be a reasonable proxy for the level of crime involving assault weapons during that period.""

Local findings

Koper told us that people who refer to a ""two-thirds"" drop might also be referring to the study’s finding of a 72 percent reduction in assault weapon use in Boston based on police data about crime guns there.

Other metro areas in the study also saw a decline, but only Boston’s dropoff was in the two-thirds range.

Milwaukee County was in the study. Data collected here -- just on guns used in homicides -- showed a 17 percent drop from 1995 to 1998 compared to before the ban.

That was the smallest reduction among weapon trends studied in Baltimore, Boston, Miami-Dade, St. Louis, Milwaukee and Anchorage. The reductions generally were between 32 and 40 percent, the study said.

The Koper study concluded by finding ""mixed"" success at reducing criminal use of banned guns -- as well as ammunition feeding devices known as large capacity magazines.

The decline suggested by the national trace data and the experience in several cities ""was offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns"" equipped with large capacity magazines, based on data studied in Baltimore, Milwaukee, Louisville, and Anchorage, the study found. There was an immense stock of exempted pre-ban magazines and it grew as more imports came in, it noted.

Bottom line, the study said, was that ""because the ban has not yet reduced the use of (large capacity magazines) in crime, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence."" The ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban weapons and magazines ensured gradual effects that ""are still unfolding and may not be fully felt for several years into the future,"" the study found.

Our rating

In a cable TV appearance, Flynn said researchers had found that ""over the course of the existence of the Brady Bill ban, the use of assault weapons in crimes decreased by two thirds.""

Flynn accurately quotes the 70 percent figure from an oft-cited study by a veteran researcher for the U.S. Department of Justice. The study makes no claim that the ban caused the apparent decline, but neither does Flynn.

Flynn’s claim suffers somewhat, though, from an excess of certainty. The study and its author offer numerous and serious cautions that make clear the 70 percent figure -- while suggestive of a major drop -- is not a definitive figure. And the study makes clear that not all weapons traced by authorities are, as Flynn’s statement implied, used ""in crimes.""

Those are important details that were missing.

"['Georgia', 'Ethics', 'David Ralston']","
Georgia ethics resolution lacks key detail, House Speaker says
","
PolitiFact wasn’t created to make elected officials more careful about what they say in public, but we like being on their mind.

Georgia House Speaker David Ralston was about to relay a statistic he was told that Georgia is the second-busiest state in terms of movie production. Then he qualified his remarks.

""I haven’t checked this yet, but I’m sure PolitiFact, if they’re here, will,"" Ralston told the Atlanta Press Club, drawing some laughter.

Don’t worry, Mr. Speaker. We’re more interested in something else you said about a piece of ethics legislation. 

In the past year, the Georgia Legislature has debated how it can improve its ethics guidelines to counter criticism that it is too beholden to lobbyists. On the first day of the 2013 legislative session, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a much-publicized resolution aimed at limiting gifts from lobbyists to the Senate.

Ralston, though, made an interesting claim about Senate Resolution 1, which passed in January.

""It doesn’t define a cap,"" Ralston, a Republican from Blue Ridge, said during a question-and-answer session with the audience. ""I don’t know if it means $100 a day or if it’s $100 a minute.""

PolitiFact Georgia was in the audience, and we wondered whether the speaker was correct about whether the resolution defines a cap.

Going into the current legislative session, Georgia was one of just three states that did not restrict lobbyists’ gifts to legislators. For years, lobbyists could make unlimited gifts to elected officials, provided they disclosed all spending. Lobbyists spent about $1.6 million a year, mostly on food, trips and event tickets for lawmakers, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Georgians were not happy with the rules, or lack thereof. Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly voted in favor of a cap on lobbyist gifts during a nonbinding referendum July 31.

Ralston has chided the Senate about its resolution, at one point famously calling it a ""visor"" instead of a ""cap."" The speaker introduced his own ethics legislation, House Bill 142, which the House passed Feb. 25. Ralston believes his legislation fits the bill of a cap. Others say break out the sun screen. The Senate is now reviewing the House bill.

So back to the Senate resolution. We reviewed the resolution’s language about gifts and here’s what it says:

""No senator shall accept any gift, other than those specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, with a value in excess of $100.00 from a registered lobbyist or a single gift from a group of registered lobbyists with a value in excess of $100.00.""

Subparagraph 3 outlined the types of items that could be accepted without regard to the $100 limit.

Ralston’s spokesman, Marshall Guest, thought the claim was straightforward.

We ran the speaker’s claim by Steve Anthony, who worked 14 years as chief of staff to Tom Murphy, a Democrat who was Georgia’s House speaker for nearly 30 years.

""He’s right,"" said Anthony, who teaches political science at Georgia State University. ""It doesn’t give a time period.""

Anthony added, ""I think the assumption is $100 per event.""

William Perry, the executive director of Common Cause Georgia, has pushed state lawmakers to enact tougher ethics legislation for years. The organization’s goals include working to strengthen public participation and transparency in state and local government. He called the Senate resolution a ""great first step"" but acknowledged it takes a few reads to understand what it means.

Like Anthony, Perry said the bill puts a $100 limit per event from lobbyists and said lobbyists and lawmakers understand the resolution’s intent. Perry is critical of the House bill, saying it allows the bigger lobbying firms to still give large sums of money by giving it to an entire county delegation -- which could be as small as two legislators -- or to the entire Georgia General Assembly.

So where does this leave us? We think Ralston has a point. The resolution doesn’t clearly define how often a lobbyist can give up to $100 to a state senator. Lawmakers and lobbyists understand the resolution’s intent, others say. We rate the speaker’s claim Mostly True.
