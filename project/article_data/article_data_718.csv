Spin on jobs data leads partisans to opposite conclusions
","
Minutes after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last week, the Washington chattering class spun like a cartoon Tasmanian Devil.

Republicans took to the airways, grumbling that Obama offered no real solutions to the country’s problems. Democrats cheered and said he had the answers.

Then came the spin typical of any major political event, whirling with facts and figures.  

The economy’s better off since Obama took office, said U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat.

""Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent during the president’s first year in office to 8.5 percent today,"" Johnson said in remarks posted on Patch.com’s local news site for Stone Mountain-Redan.

No, the economy’s worse, said U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Marietta Republican.

Three years into Obama’s presidency, ""2 million more Americans are out of work,"" Gingrey said in a news release posted on Rome Newswire, an online news site covering the Rome area.  

Can these both be true? Is it possible for unemployment to drop as the ranks of people who are out of work grow?

Because of this conundrum, we’ll depart from our usual Truth-O-Meter format and do a special doubleheader. We’ll check both stats and tell you whether one of them is wrong or whether it’s possible for both to be correct.

First, let’s consider Johnson’s unemployment statistic.

In January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, unemployment stood at 7.8 percent. It peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, eight months later.  

In December 2011, the rate stood at 8.5 percent.

Johnson’s numbers are accurate, but he runs into trouble when he said that ""it is remarkable what President Obama has achieved in his first three years.""

Labor economists have repeatedly told PolitiFact that it’s hard for any political leader to take credit or blame for something as complicated as the economy.

Johnson spokesman Andrew Phelan offered proof to bolster the congressman’s claim that Obama deserves credit for lower unemployment. He cited a November report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which reviews bills that will have an impact on the federal budget. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the stimulus legislation  that Obama backed, lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points during the third quarter of 2011, the office determined.

Phelan also cited a 2010 report by a Princeton professor and the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics saying the Recovery Act and monetary policy reduced unemployment.

Still, other factors are at play. For this reason, Johnson’s statement earns a Half True.

Now on to Gingrey’s statement, where he says ""2 million more Americans are out of work.""

Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber pointed us to a July check by our PolitiFact Ohio colleagues. It analyzed a television ad by the Republican National Committee criticizing Obama’s economic policies.

Since he took office, it said, ""2 million jobs. Gone.""

PolitiFact Ohio found that the drop in employment was actually more severe than the ad said. The economy lost 2.5 million jobs between January 2009 and May 2011, according to employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks employment and other economic data.

But the ad was missing a crucial piece of context. It neglected to mention that the economy gained 1 million jobs in the year before the ad came out. PolitiFact Ohio gave the claim a Mostly True.

Six months have passed since PolitiFact Ohio’s story ran, so we checked the latest employment statistics to see whether the figures were still correct.

We found that the country’s employment outlook is sunnier.

In December, there were nearly 132 million nonfarm employees in the U.S., down 1.66 million from January 2009. This means that Gingrey’s 2 million figure is some 20 percent too high.

We found a few other problems with Gingrey’s use of employment data.

When the economy loses nonfarm jobs, it does not mean that ""2 million more Americans are out of work,"" as Gingrey said. The Bureau of Labor Statistics did not design this metric to measure how many people have become unemployed.

It’s likely many did get laid off. But others might have chosen to return to school, become stay-at-home parents or leave the workforce for any number of other reasons.

It’s also worth noting that while payrolls have declined since January 2009, they’ve been rising since October 2010, according to BLS data.  

Because Gingrey’s claim cherry-picks unflattering data and his numbers could use some freshening up, we rate his statement Half True.

Now we come to the larger issue at hand. Gingrey and Johnson used valid data to give opposite impressions of the state of the economy. Their interpretations had some shortcomings but weren’t wholly incorrect.

So how is this possible? Can unemployment decline under Obama if payrolls shrank?

Yes. The reason is that Gingrey and Johnson used data from different time periods.

Gingrey chose to consider nonfarm payroll numbers starting in winter 2009, while Johnson started his unemployment count in October 2009.

The economy didn’t post its worst numbers until the latter half of 2009.

Between January 2009 and December 2011, the economy lost jobs. Nonfarm payrolls decreased by some 1.7 million jobs. As you’d expect, unemployment increased during the same time period from 7.8 percent to 8.5 percent.

But from October 2009 to December 2011, the economy gained jobs. Nonfarm payrolls actually rose by about 2.4 million. Unemployment dropped from 10 percent to 8.5 percent.  

It’s easy to cherry-pick data that give opposite impressions of the nation’s economic health. With statistics, the devil’s in the details.",/factchecks/2012/feb/01/phil-gingrey/spin-jobs-data-leads-partisans-opposite-conclusion/

Newt Gingrich says in 1992 Mitt Romney gave campaign dollars to three Democrats
","
With two days to go before Florida’s Republican primary, Newt Gingrich appeared on Face the Nation in Miami Jan. 29, 2012 and lashed out at Mitt Romney for giving dollars to Democrats.

""It is a fact in 1992, (Romney) gave money to Democrats for Congress, (and) he voted in the Democratic Primary for Paul Tsongas who was the most liberal candidate,"" Gingrich said.

We fact-checked Romney’s claim from the Jan. 26 Jacksonville debate, ""I’ve never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot,"" and gave that a Half True. Romney acknowledged that he voted for Tsongas in the 1992 presidential primary; he could have voted in the Republican primary instead.

In this fact-check, we will focus on whether Romney gave money to Democrats running for Congress in 1992.

We emailed Romney spokespersons and did not get a response. But we found plenty of news articles and data that related to Gingrich’s claim.

Romney mostly donated to Republicans

When we searched the Federal Election Commission website we found Romney donations only going back to 1997. At our request, the FEC ran a report for us that included donations from 1998 back to 1988.

That data showed three donations to Democrats in 1992: $1,000 to Douglas Anderson, $250 to John LaFalce and $250 to Richard Swett. (More on these candidates in a bit.) That information was in line with what the Gingrich campaign provided us, as well as election contributions gathered by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

We couldn’t help but notice, however, that during the past 20 years the bulk of donations made by Romney were to Republican candidates or committees. We found the easiest way to search his donations was by looking at the Center for Responsive Politics’ Open Secrets website -- searching both by Mitt Romney and his actual first name, Willard Romney.

Searching this way, we found donations to about 23 individuals, and only three were Democrats. Sometimes Romney gave to the same individual more than once so ultimately there were far more than two dozen donations to candidates. Romney also gave thousands to state and national Republican committees. Interestingly, he also made donations to one of his current rivals for the Republican nomination -- Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. 

What the three Democrats said about Romney

Even though the donations to Democrats were exceptions to the rule, let’s take a closer look at the three Democratic candidates:

• U. S. Rep. Richard Swett was a U.S. Representative from New Hampshire from Jan. 3, 1991 to Jan. 3, 1995. Swett was later the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark and now is CEO of Climate Prosperity Enterprise Solutions in New Hampshire.

• Douglas Delano Anderson was a Harvard Business school professor who lost a Democratic U.S. Senate primary in Utah in 1992. Anderson is now a Dean at the Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University.

• U.S. Rep John J. LaFalce: was a U.S. Representative from New York Jan. 3, 1975 to Jan. 3, 2003. He is now special counsel at a law firm.

The Truth-O-Meter spoke with all three Democrats.

Swett said that he knew Romney since young adulthood -- both had homes on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. Swett also said that like Romney, he is a Mormon.

""I’m a fiscally conservative, socially progressive Democrat,"" Swett said. ""I’ve had a lot of Republicans give in my political career.""

Anderson responded in a short email that he and Romney have ""been close personal friends for 38 years.""

LaFalce told us ""I haven’t the vaguest idea"" why Romney donated to him. LaFalce said he doesn’t recall meeting Romney personally and speculates that Romney gave to him because LaFalce was an active member of the banking committee.  LaFalce said he received a lot of donations from individuals in the financial services industry.

Our ruling

Gingrich said that in 1992, Romney ""gave money to Democrats for Congress."" We should note that for the past 20 years, Romney has given the majority of his donations to Republican candidates and committees. But Gingrich was specific in his attack here, and   Romney did give money to three Democratic candidates that year.

Newt Gingrich says government would impose 'Obamacare' standards on religious institutions
","Newt Gingrich, on the campaign trail before the Florida GOP primary, called out the Barack Obama administration for engaging in a ""war against religion.""

Federal officials' interpretation of the 2010 health care law violates religious freedom, he said.

""Their decision last week that they would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance is a direct violation of freedom of religion, an example of the dictatorial attitude of this administration,"" he told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 30, 2012.

What decision was he talking about? One about birth control. His campaign pointed us to criticism from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops of a Jan. 20 decision that ""ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans,"" according to the group.

The bishops said ""almost every employer and insurer.""

We wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration ""would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance""?

'The Obamacare standard'

The rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care.

We should mention: There's not a clear ""Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance."" The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover ""essential health benefits."" They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states.

The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-pays kept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmental Institute of Medicine recommended that preventive services include ""all FDA-approved forms of contraception."" So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services.

Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptions

Notice we said that ""most"" health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said ""almost every employer and insurer.""

Gingrich said, ""every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution.""

But the rule provides an exemption for ""certain non-profit religious employers"" that meet a four-part test -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. 

It's that definition of ""religious employer"" that has prompted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups.

That would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs — which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ella can be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA.

The government is giving such nonprofit religious groups an extra year to implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them.

The decision already faces legal challenges from Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University.

Still, if you consider a Catholic church to be a ""Catholic institution,"" or a synagogue to be a ""Jewish institution,"" Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services.

Our ruling Gingrich said that ""the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance."" 

He makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket ""Obamacare standard"" for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans.

Meanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court. But it makes Gingrich's statement that the rule would ""impose on every ... institution"" inaccurate and misleading. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd0ecf5b-876e-4cfe-ac88-5c90949e8e9f",/factchecks/2012/jan/31/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-obama-administration-would-impo/

Ron Paul says federal income tax rate was 0 percent until 1913
","
Asked at a recent Republican presidential debate to specify what the highest federal income tax rate should be, the candidates offered various figures: 15 percent from Newt Gingrich, 20 percent from Rick Perry, 25 percent from Mitt Romney, and 28 percent from Rick Santorum. 
When it was Ron Paul’s turn to respond, the Texas congressman undercut the previous answers, saying: ""We should have the lowest tax that we’ve ever had, and up until 1913, it was 0 percent. What’s so bad about that?"" 
It’s no secret that Paul favors smaller government and less taxation. His campaign website says that as president, he would support a constitutional amendment to abolish the income tax. If that can’t be done, however, the web page says, another way to bring the income tax rate to 0 percent would be to restrain federal spending ""by enforcing the Constitution’s strict limits on the federal government’s power."" 
PolitiFact has delved into the history of the federal income tax for previous fact-checks, and PolitiFact Texas explored its origins in December 2010 after Perry linked Woodrow Wilson, the Progressive movement and the income tax while promoting his book Fed Up! That look noted Americans first paid an income tax 50 years before Wilson’s presidency, after Congress approved one in 1861 to help cover the expenses of the Civil War; it expired in 1872. 
So, is it accurate to say Americans paid a zero income tax rate until 1913? 
Let’s review the history. 
First of all, Paul had a reason for mentioning 1913; the 16th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified that year, legalizing a federal income tax, and Congress approved legislation enacting one. The 1913 law imposed a tax of 1 percent on income up to $20,000, for both individual and joint filers. However, exemptions from the tax — the first $3,000 of income for individuals and the first $4,000 for joint filers — meant ""virtually all middle-class Americans"" were excused from paying, according to W. Elliot Brownlee’s book, Federal Taxation in America. The law also put in place a graduated surtax on incomes above $20,000; the highest rate paid, 7 percent, applied to Americans making more than $500,000 (about $11.4 million in 2011 dollars). 
The amendment’s ratification came nearly two decades after the U.S. Supreme Court in 1895 voided an income tax that Congress had approved a year earlier. That tax never took effect. The court declared the tax unconstitutional because it was not apportioned according to the population of each state, as the Constitution then required. That meant, for example, that if 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, no more than 5 percent of the tax’s total revenue could come from Virginia. 
The 16th Amendment removed this barrier by authorizing Congress to collect taxes on incomes ""without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration."" 
To gauge how the income tax worked in its first incarnation, we consulted sources detailing the Civil War-era levy — including two history books and the Tax History Museum website, a project of the nonprofit group Tax Analysts, based in Falls Church, Va. The sources don’t concur on every detail, but how the tax came to be comes clear. 
Congress enacted the nation’s first federal income tax in 1861, setting a flat rate of 3 percent on incomes higher than $800. 
Over the next four years, Congress expanded the tax as members cut the amount of income that could be exempted and introduced higher, graduated rates. By 1865, the last year of the Civil War, the highest income tax rate, 10 percent, was applied to income in excess of $5,000, according to Roy and Gladys Blakey’s 1940 book, The Federal Income Tax. According to Brownlee’s book, more than 10 percent of Union households were paying the income tax at the end of the war. 
With hostilities over, however, Congress was eager to reduce the tax burden, so it began raising the tax’s income exemption level and lowering the rate. By 1870, the exemption level had been increased to $2,000 and the rate reduced to 2.5 percent. 
According to the Blakeys’ book, the lawmakers of the Civil War era intended the income tax to be a temporary wartime tool. At least four of the income tax measures enacted during the war and soon after contained a provision saying that the law was to be in force until 1870 and ""no longer,"" the Blakeys wrote. Ultimately, Congress voted to let the income tax expire in 1872. 
We checked in with Joseph Thorndike, director of Tax Analysts’ Tax History Project, who told us that he thought Paul’s statement at the debate was fair. Pointing to the temporary nature of the wartime tax and the four decades that the United States went without an income tax before 1913, Thorndike said his view is that the Civil War-era tax should be a ""relatively small caveat"" to the statement that there was no federal income tax until 1913. 
Our ruling 
Paul’s statement that the federal income tax rate was zero until 1913 reflects the timing of the constitutional change enabling the current tax. But his claim disregards two pre-1913 efforts to impose an income tax — one of which was in place for a decade. This debate claim rates Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/31/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-federal-income-tax-rate-was-0-percen/

Lt. Gov. makes big claim about Savannah port
","
For more than a year, Georgia leaders have spoken about the importance of deepening the Port of Savannah as a way to boost the state’s economy.

The state has invested $136 million toward such work in the past three years, and leaders are lobbying the federal government for additional funds to deepen the Savannah port to prepare for the megasized container ships that will traverse the Panama Canal by 2014 and look for ports along the East Coast to dock.

Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle offered up a piece of information to emphasize the importance of this effort during a speech to the Atlanta Press Club.

Savannah, he said, is home to ""the fastest-growing port in the nation.""

True? PolitiFact Georgia set sail to find out whether Cagle is right.

Others, including U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, have made similar claims. But PolitiFact Georgia found news reports stating that the port in Wilmington, N.C., is the nation’s fastest-growing port. Cagle’s office sent us a graphic from the Georgia Ports Authority showing the Savannah port is receiving more imports and exports than 10 large American ports.

Unbeknown to us, there are all sorts of annual reports and statistics about the approximately 360 ports in the United States. Some track the annual value of items that come through the ports. Some track it by the amount of containers that are imported and exported at the ports, measured in 20-foot equivalent units, or known as TEUs. There is also port data measured in metric tons (about 2,200 pounds) or short tons (2,000 pounds).

The Georgia Center of Innovation for Logistics, a state agency that works to find solutions to challenges encountered by shipping and transportation entities, measures growth by TEUs, saying it is the standard used internationally. It provided us a chart showing the average annual growth rate at the Savannah port between 2000 and 2010 has been 11.5 percent, more than any of what they said are the nation’s 10 largest ports. Houston’s port was second at 5.5 percent. Overall, the numbers show Savannah is home to the nation’s fourth-largest port.

""The Port of Savannah, from container volume, is the fastest-growing in the United States,"" said Page Siplon, a spokesman for the center.

The Georgia center’s number is similar to TEU data compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Research and Innovative Technology Administration, or RITA. Savannah’s average annual growth rate was 11.5 percent between 1995 and 2009, the data show. Its chart included the top 10 ports. Savannah had the highest percentage growth between 1995 and 2009 and since 2000.

The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration also keeps port data in metric tons. Between 2003 and 2010, the Norfolk, Va., port had the fastest average annual percentage growth rate among midsize and larger ports. Savannah was second. Between 2006 and 2010, Norfolk was first again. Wilmington was second among ports with more than 5 million metric tons.

Ah, but that’s the problem, Siplon says. While Wilmington’s port handled 6.1 million metric tons in 2009, Savannah’s port handled 29.7 metric tons that year. There’s no reasonable way to compare some ports, he says.

""It’s not a fair representation,"" Siplon told us.

The American Association of Port Authorities, an Alexandria, Va.-based organization that helps promote ports in the Western Hemisphere, said the RITA data does not include military containers or containerized cargo shipped domestically between U.S. ports.

The AAPA also collects container data on ports, through TEUs, and shared it with us. It showed Savannah with the highest percentage annual growth rate in the past five and 10 years among the 16 ports that currently handle more than 500,000 TEUs a year. Several ports that handled smaller annual TEUs -- such as Boston, Mobile, New Orleans and Wilmington -- had higher percentage growth at times in recent years.

The AAPA numbers show the Savannah port had the largest container increase in TEUs of any U.S. port since 2006. The largest U.S. ports, such as New York/New Jersey and Los Angeles, had larger container increases since 2001 and in the U.S. DOT data. We note that the ports in Los Angeles and New York/New Jersey are already two or three times larger than Savannah’s.

""Savannah is the fastest-growing port among larger ports,"" said Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, who frequently tracks data on ports. ""Obviously, there are smaller ports that will have the biggest change.""

Among the big dogs of American ports, it appears the Savannah port is the nation’s fastest-growing port. But some smaller ports could argue that they are growing at a faster rate. Experts are also careful to say Savannah is the nation's fastest-growing container port. PolitiFact Georgia thinks the lieutenant governor has a strong argument, but we must include the caveat of some of these smaller ports. We rate Cagle’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/31/casey-cagle/lt-gov-makes-big-claim-about-savannah-port/

Jim Jordan says subsidy for the Volt averages out to as much as $250,000 a car
","
Political charges were in the air at a Jan. 25, 2012, congressional hearing on the Chevrolet Volt chaired by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch critic of the Obama administration’s intervention in the General Motors bankruptcy.

Jordan, from Ohio’s Champaign County, said he called the hearing to explore whether the government’s involvement in General Motors swayed how the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration informed consumers about crash tests that caused fires in the hybrid electric vehicles’ batteries. At the hearing, his committee released a report titled: ""Government Motors: A Preliminary Report on the Effects of Bailouts and Politics on the Obama Administration’s Ability to Protect American Consumers."" He opened the hearing with a statement that outlined some of his beefs with the government’s role in GM, including tax subsidies to the Volt.

""Total federal, state and local governments have subsidized the production of the Volt to the tune of estimates between $50,000 and $250,000 per vehicle sold,"" said Jordan.

That number seemed shocking for a car with a low-end retail price of $31,645, so we asked Jordan’s office where it came from. His spokeswoman said his statement relied on a Dec. 21 study from Michigan’s Mackinac Center for Public Policy - which estimated that each of the 6,000 Volts sold up until that date has received between $50,000 and $250,000 in subsidies.

Its analysis tallied up nearly $3 billion worth of state and federal assistance it said were offered for the Volt’s development and production.

It cited 18 tax credits and government subsidies for General Motors and its suppliers - such as a $105.9 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to the General Motors plant in Brownstown Township southwest of Detroit, a $106 million state job retention credit for its Detroit-Hamtramck plant and up to $100 million in refundable battery credits for a Volt battery supplier called Compact Power.

The biggest slice of that money - $1.5 billion - comes from a $7,500 tax credit that the IRS offered to the the first 200,000 buyers of the Volt, or other electric cars from GM. Similar credits are available to buyers of other manufacturers’ electric vehicles. When author James Hohman compiled his statistics, roughly 6,000 Volts had been sold. By the time Jordan held his hearing, GM said the vehicle’s sales were around 8,000.

""GM has estimated they’ve sold 6,000 Volts so far,"" said Mackinac’s report on Hohman’s work. ""That would mean each of the 6,000 Volts sold would be subsidized between $50,000 and $250,000, depending on how many government subsidy milestones are reached.""

The report said it didn’t include subsidies that could boost the level of government aid, such as the land for one of the GM assembly plants being acquired through eminent domain by General Motors. Hohman said the Volt ""might be the most government-supported car since the Trabant,"" a car that was made by the formerly communist state of East Germany.

Mackinac’s data was attacked immediately. An analysis in The Street   on Dec. 22, 2011, criticized its methodology of dividing $1.5 billion in subsidies by the 6,000 cars sold to reach his $250,000 per vehicle number. The Street, a digital financial media company established in 1996, said the author would have reached a very different statistic if the study had been done at the end of 2012 - when GM projects it will have made 60,000 of the cars. It said that technology from the car will be used in roughly 60 million vehicles over the next in 25 years, which would make for a subsidy of roughly $25 per car.

""The absurdity of the math used can be further shown by asking what the study would have yielded if it had been done six months ago or a year ago,"" said The Street. ""Six months ago, 3,000 Volts had been sold and therefore the implied subsidy was $500,000 per car - half as many cars, twice the subsidy per car. One year ago, the first Volt was sold and therefore this one car must have cost $1.5 billion, according to the reasoning by the people who wrote the headlines around this study.""

General Motors spokesman Greg Martin said Mackinac’s study ""is not even in the same area code as accurate."" He said the study compiled ""every conceivable"" energy battery subsidy over the past several years, whether or not it had anything to do with the Volt, added it up and ""came up with this outrageous $250,000 subsidy per Volt.""

For example, five of the tax credits and loans cited in Mackinac’s report, totaling more than $388 million - went to a battery maker called A123 that has nothing to do with the Volt, Martin said. He says it’s fair to question the wisdom of of subsidies and consumer incentives for vehicle purchases, but a serious debate ""should not be clouded and distracted by fun and games with numbers.""

In an emailed response to questions about his study,  Hohman said its high-end $250,000 estimate includes the A123 money that GM disputes  ""because, at the time the incentives were being awarded, both government policy makers and the company itself were unsure about the suppliers.""

""However, with the Volt in mind as the standard bearer for the idea of a mass produced American-made EV, it was unlikely that a lot of these deals would have been approved--or certainly approved at the levels offered -- without the Volt.""  Hohman’s email said.

Although Hohman says a number of Volt-associated projects got local government assistance in addition to federal and state aid, he excluded those incentives from his calculations because they were inconsistently reported.  

Hohman said he felt that calculating the maximum amount of assistance offered to the Volt added valuable context to discussions about the vehicle. He said the federal and state entities that awarded incentives to the project ""never got together to try to figure out just how much each car would receive."" He said The Street was correct to assert  that the per-vehicle subsidy he calculated would decrease as more vehicles are sold, but said that’s a ""clear implication from how we describe the calculations.""

Ernest Goss, an economist at Nebraska’s Creighton University who is critical of tax incentives to large companies, said such incentives often lead to construction of projects that would not be built otherwise and may be mistakes. He said he believes the Chevrolet Volt ""is very costly to the taxpayer and probably not worth the subsidy,"" but the scope of government subsidies can be difficult to gauge.

""The question is, what subsidies do you count?"" says Goss. ""There is no doubt there have been significant subsidies going to GM, which is problematic, given that GM was bailed out and taxpayers still own a significant share of GM.""

So, where does that leave Jordan’s assertion?

Jordan’s claim is partially accurate. He stated it as fact, relying on the study from the Mackinac Center. That study did estimate the Volt has received between $50,000 and $250,000 in aid per vehicle, although its tally did not include local government aid, as Jordan said. And his underlying point is true -- that there has been much subsidy directed toward development of the Volt.

But the claim leaves out important details that are need to fully understand the truth.

Mackinac’s numbers seem inexact and fluid and designed to make headlines at the expense of accuracy. They include money that went to a company that doesn’t supply the Volt.

And the per-vehicle tally considers all aid awarded at a time when Volt sales are just beginning. That figure will fall dramatically -- a point the study’s author concedes -- as more Volts and cars that use its technology are sold, with one analysis citing a figure of $25 per car if projected out over the next 25 years.

U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse will have added nearly $8 trillion to the national debt during his first term
","
Barry Hinckley, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has posted several short issue-oriented videos on YouTube, including ""Era of disgrace,"" which attacks incumbent Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse for helping to grow the national debt.

Hinckley says that ""career politicians have spent us into the ground. They have taxed our children's future away. Sheldon Whitehouse's failure of leadership, the adding of almost $8 trillion in debt in his first full term, is shameful and shows he is unwilling to tackle the problem and go to work on behalf of our children.""

We’ll check two parts of this claim -- whether the debt will increase by $8 trillion by the time Whitehouse completes his first term and the degree to which Whitehouse is responsible.

First, let's check the number.

The U.S. government's Treasury Direct website regularly calculates the national debt to the penny and lets people track it over time. From Jan. 3, 2007, when Whitehouse took office, to Jan. 17, 2012, when Hinckley posted the video, the total public debt outstanding went from $8.68 trillion to $15.24 trillion.

That's a difference of $6.56 trillion. That's almost $7 trillion but not ""almost $8 trillion."" So he's not there yet.

How much is the debt likely to rise by January 2013 when Whitehouse's first term expires? We looked back and found that the increase can vary significantly from year to year. From 2007 to 2008 it went up by 6.1 percent but the next year, it increased by 15.4 percent. Last year it went up by 8.8 percent.

So we used the yearly increase for the past five years since Whitehouse has been in office and projected them onto the debt on Jan. 3, 2012. Then we subtracted the amount the U.S. government owed when Whitehouse took office.

The range: from $7.5 trillion to $8.9 trillion.

In addition, the federal budget for 2012 predicts that by Sept. 30, the gross federal debt will be $16.6 trillion, $8 trillion more than when Whitehouse took office.

So Hinckley's ""nearly $8 trillion"" is correct.

Second, is the increase a result of Whitehouse's ""failure of leadership?""

When we asked the Hinckley campaign how Whitehouse could be held responsible for the increase, he issued a statement through his spokeswoman: ""He's made no difference in terms of controlling our debt and has made a huge difference in compliantly increasing it.""

Neither Congress nor the president has complete control over the growth in government spending. Throughout his term in office, Whitehouse's party has controlled the Senate. But Republicans held the presidency during his first two years and Republicans will have controlled the House during the last two.

In addition, Whitehouse is currently just one of 51 Democratic Senators and, under the current rules, a bill needs at least some degree of Republican support before it can pass there.

To suggest, as Hinckley's statement does, that Rhode Island's junior senator is the leader who is destined to saddle the United States with an extra $8 trillion in debt is -- to put it mildly -- a stretch. A lot of other politicians, including members of Hinckley's own party, have played a significant role as well, including passing the budgets that have led to the debt increase.

Our ruling

The national debt is on track to possibly double since Whitehouse took his Senate seat in January 2007, increasing by roughly $8 trillion. Hinckley said it would be ""nearly $8 trillion more,"" and that number may be conservative.

That part of his statement is true.

Whitehouse, as one among 100 Senators and a member of the majority party, bears some responsibility for that increase, but not nearly as much as Hinckley is trying to imply.

We rate his statement Half True.

Viral Internet story says Mitt Romney helped locate missing teen daughter of Bain Capital partner
","A number of readers recently have asked us to fact-check a story about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The story, currently circulating on email, Facebook, and blogs, says that Romney helped a colleague of his at Bain Capital locate his missing teenage daughter.

""In July 1996, the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital, had disappeared,"" the story reads. ""She had attended a rave party in New York City and gotten high on ecstasy. Three days later, her distraught father had no idea where she was. Romney took immediate action. He closed down the entire firm and asked all 30 partners and employees to fly to New York to help find Gay’s daughter. Romney set up a command center at the LaGuardia Marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search. He established a toll-free number for tips, coordinating the effort with the NYPD, and went through his Rolodex and called everyone Bain did business with in New York and asked them to help find his friend’s missing daughter. Romney’s accountants at Price Waterhouse Cooper put up posters on street poles, while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by Bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper. Romney and the other Bain employees scoured every part of New York and talked with everyone they could – prostitutes, drug addicts – anyone.

""That day, their hunt made the evening news, which featured photos of the girl and the Bain employees searching for her. As a result, a teenage boy phoned in, asked if there was a reward, and then hung up abruptly. The NYPD traced the call to a home in New Jersey, where they found the girl in the basement, shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose. Doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day. Romney’s former partner credits Mitt Romney with saving his daughter’s life, saying, ‘It was the most amazing thing, and I’ll never forget this to the day I die.’

""So, here’s my epiphany: Mitt Romney simply can’t help himself. He sees a problem, and his mind immediately sets to work solving it, sometimes consciously, and sometimes not-so-consciously. He doesn’t do it for self-aggrandizement or for personal gain. He does it because that’s just how he’s wired.""

We can’t speak to what this episode says about Romney’s deeper character, but we can verify the facts of the episode. In fact, we did so when this story came up during the 2008 presidential election season.

Back then, the story was circulating because of television ad created by Romney’s campaign. It featured Gay crediting Romney with helping reunite him with his daughter.

As we reported then, based on contemporary news reports, the girl sneaked away on July 6, 1996, to go to a rave party in New York City, where she took the drug Ecstasy. She had told her parents she was playing tennis.

When she didn't return, Boston-based Bain Capital, where Romney was founder and CEO, essentially shut down to help search for Gay's 14-year-old daughter Melissa.

Bain Capital's 50 employees went to New York, where they convinced more than 200 other people to help search the streets for two days. They printed and passed out fliers. Romney clearly had a leading role in the company's operations, but news reports from the time also said other Bain partners helped coordinate the search effort.

According to news reports, the teen was found in suburban New Jersey. A teen-aged boy, who took her in after her partying, called authorities late on July 11.

Lt. David Peterson of the Montville Township Police told PolitiFact four years ago that police reports do not mention Romney personally. But Peterson, as well as reports at the time, agreed that the Bain Capital search generated important attention to the case of the missing girl.

""The thing was it was a 911 caller that saw her on Channel 7 and called in,"" said Peterson, who recalled waiting for the girl to be picked up from Montville police station.

Gay says Romney helped ""save"" his daughter, though previous reports have differed on the condition she was in. The line in the retelling now circulating -- that doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day -- comes from a Boston Globe report in 2002.

Newsday, for its part, reported in July 1996 that ""Melissa's parents said she was physically unharmed though she appeared 'very fragile.' The family's doctor had examined the girl and pronounced her in fairly good condition. ...""

""She was not harmed,"" Robert Gay said at news conference after she was found, according to the New York Daily News. ""She was in tears. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home.""

By all accounts, the effort by Bain employees was central to the effort to locate the girl, and Romney reportedly played a significant role in that effort. We give the account now circulating a rating of True.  ",/factchecks/2012/jan/30/chain-email/viral-internet-story-says-mitt-romney-helped-locat/

Newt Gingrich says students today 'take more years to get through' college
","Newt Gingrich says too many college students are slackers. During a campaign event in Stuart, Fla., on Jan. 28, 2012, Newt Gingrich said college students are taking too long to graduate.

""Students take fewer classes per semester. They take more years to get through. Why? Because they have free money,"" Gingrich said. ""I would tell students: ‘Get through as quick as you can. Borrow as little as you can. Have a part-time job.’ But that’s very different from the culture that has grown up in the last 20 years.""

We wondered whether the statistics showed that students are indeed taking longer to graduate than they did in the past. So we looked into it.

We turned to figures on post-secondary education compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Department of Education. As it turns out, the trend for four-year colleges is exactly the opposite.

Percent of bachelor’s degree-seeking students completing bachelor's degrees within four years after start, at all four-year institutions
  
So the percentage of students completing degrees within four years has actually risen incrementally in recent years. Between the graduating classes of 2000 and 2006, the percentage of students graduating in four years increased by one-sixth.

So where four-year colleges are concerned, Gingrich’s comment is off the mark. But Gingrich has a point in regard to two-year institutions.

Percent completing certificates or associate's degrees within 150 percent of normal time, all two-year institutions     
  
So for two-year institutions, the rate did fall slightly, though by less than what the rate for four-year institutions rose.

Christopher Swanson, the vice president for research and development at Editorial Projects in Education, the publisher of Education Week, said that in general, education experts haven’t been worried so much that the trendlines for college completion are going in the wrong direction. ""The main narrative you hear about (concerns) the low completion rates in general,"" he said. On that score, he said, ""there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot to write home about.""

Swanson did take issue with the general tenor of Gingrich’s comments -- that you should borrow as little as you can and instead get a job if you want to increase the likelihood that you’ll finish college on time.

""That seems to fly in the face of what I think is a pretty well-established finding from the research that working during college or post-secondary education tends to be detrimental in terms of completion (that is, that you’re less likely to complete) and time to completion (that it takes longer),"" Swanson said. ""There may be any number of issues and problems with excessive student borrowing, but being able to borrow for college does allow students the opportunity to focus more exclusively on their school work than would probably have been the case otherwise. If you follow the don’t borrow/get a job argument and play that out a bit, that sounds a lot like what happens as a matter of course in community colleges. And the completion rates there are extremely low, on the order of one-third completing within an extended timeline.""

Our ruling

Gingrich said that students today ""take more years to get through"" college. While graduation rates are lower than experts would like them to be, it's not true that students are taking longer to graduate from four-year institutions. The percentage graduating on time at four-year colleges has actually risen consistently in recent years. The only exception to this pattern is at two-year colleges, where the percentage of students graduating within three years has fallen slightly. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/670cf7ee-39a3-41a7-9d3a-e6c3459864a0",/factchecks/2012/jan/30/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-students-today-take-more-years-/

Wisconsin Democrat says proposed mine would be nearly as big as state's largest inland lake
","Would a proposed iron ore mine in Wisconsin be nearly the size of one of the nation’s largest inland lakes?

About an hour into an 11-hour legislative hearing on Jan. 11, 2012, state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, worried aloud about environmental damage such an operation might cause.

The second-term Assembly member compared the mine to Lake Winnebago, the largest of Wisconsin’s 15,000 inland lakes and one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in the U.S.

""That's a very large lake that's right at the end of the area that I represent,  extremely large lake. And from what I've tried to figure out on the central size of this mine, it could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago,"" Bernard Schaber said. ""And Lake Winnebago, I encourage you to go there. I’ve ridden my bike around it and it’s a hundred miles-plus to ride your bike around the lake.""

Size would help determine whether the mine would help create thousands of jobs, as its supporters contend, as well as what impact it would have on land and water.

So let’s see if Bernard Schaber’s comparison measures up. Billion-dollar mine

News surfaced in November 2010 that Gogebic Taconite proposed to spend more than $1 billion to develop an open-pit iron ore mine more than 300 miles northwest of Milwaukee in far northern Wisconsin. It would take years to open the mine, if various government approvals are won.

Gogebic Taconite hasn’t made a formal proposal to the state as it waits to see whether Assembly Bill 426, which has generated lobbying activity by 34 organizations, becomes law. The bill, which would relax environmental standards and public participation in the review process for the mine, was approved Jan. 26, 2012 by the Republican-controlled Assembly, with Bernard Schaber and every other Democrat in attendance voting no.

Gogebic president Bill Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the company would need up to 5,000 acres to encompass the mine -- roughly four miles long and a half-mile wide -- and facilities such as roads, waste-rock storage and ore processing.

That would be nowhere near two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago, which has an area of about 138,000 acres.

We sought out a state mine expert and spoke with Ann Coakley, director of the waste and materials management bureau of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. She noted Gogebic has spoken about a possibly wider mine -- 1.5 miles wide rather than a half-mile. But even at that, she estimated that the total footprint likely would be 10,000 acres. That, too, is much less than two-thirds the area of Lake Winnebago. Lawmaker's evidence So, does Bernard Schaber have evidence that the mine would be two-thirds as big as the lake?

No and yes.

Legislative aide Eric Koch said his boss believes the space needed for the related facilities, added to the mine itself, would make the total footprint two-thirds the size of the lake. But he acknowledged she has no solid data to support that estimate.  

In a written summary and other documents Bernard Schaber provided to back up her claim, she introduced a different measurement: volume.

She starts with the dimensions of Lake Winnebago, citing a DNR document. If we round the figures Bernard Schaber cites, the lake has an area of nearly 138,000 acres, which is about 6 billion square feet. She multiplies 6 billion square feet by the lake’s average depth of 15.5 feet, for a total of 93 billion cubic feet.

Now to the size of the mine.

Noting that Gogebic Taconite has given varying dimensions of what the size of the mine itself might be, Bernard Schaber used a length of 4.5 miles and a width of three-quarters of a mile. That comes to 3.375 square miles or about 94 million square feet. She multiplies that figure by 1,000 feet, which has been the reported depth of the mine, to come up with a total of 94 billion cubic feet -- a volume even larger than Lake Winnebago’s.

Gogebic Taconite’s Williams told us the mine’s depth would range from 700 to 1,000 feet. But even if we used 700 instead of 1,000 in the equation, we’d get a mine depth of 66 billion cubic feet -- more than two-thirds the volume of Lake Winnebago.

So, when depth is added to length and width, the mine is at or near the size of the lake. But at the hearing Bernard Schaber -- who spoke of biking around the lake -- was clearly referring to area, not volume.

Our rating

Bernard Schaber said ""the central size"" of a mine proposed for far northern Wisconsin ""could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago."" There’s an element of truth in her statement, in terms of volume. But she lacks evidence to back her central claim, which was area.

We rate her statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/30/penny-bernard-schaber/wisconsin-democrat-says-proposed-mine-would-be-nea/

Chris Christie’s record touted in video ad by Committee for Our Children’s Future
","
A new ad depicts Trenton officials as a group of rowdy children who have marred their house with gummy carpets and chalk-strewn walls.

But then Gov. Chris Christie arrives and straightens the place up in the 30-second spot released by Committee for Our Children’s Future, a nonprofit group that supports the governor.

""For years, politicians have run amok in Trenton and cleaning up their mess hasn't been easy, but [with] Gov. Chris Christie and bipartisan reformers: the most job growth in 11 years, millions in new education funding, two budgets balanced,"" the narrator says in the ad released Jan. 25. ""Christie and reformers are working to strengthen our economy, improve education and cut income taxes for all New Jersey families. Join our reform movement, because cleaning up is never easy, but it's worth it.""

PolitiFact New Jersey has addressed two of these claims previously: the governor increased education funding this year and he’s balanced two budgets, as he’s required to do.

Now, we’re checking the claim that with Christie and bipartisan reformers, New Jersey had the ""most job growth in 11 years.""

Brian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children’s Future, first sent us a Jan. 15 Asbury Park Press article to support the claim. It states that job growth last year ""put the state on pace for its best year since 2000, when it added 77,100 jobs.""

But PolitiFact New Jersey’s analysis of the most recent state data, which is still subject to revision, doesn’t support that conclusion.

Let’s look at job growth in the Garden State.

In 2011, New Jersey gained 39,400 private-sector jobs and lost 3,000 government jobs. The net gain, then, was 36,400 jobs.

In 2004, the state added 37,700 jobs of which 14,700 were from the public sector

Prior to that, New Jersey had the most job growth in 2000, with an overall increase of 77,100 jobs.

So, last year New Jersey had the highest total employment growth in seven years.

When we reached back out to Jones, he said the statement in the ad was referring to private-sector employment, which grew more last year than in 11 years.

""There’s been bloated government in Trenton for too long. Governor Christie’s policies are working to trim the fat, while growing private-sector jobs,"" he said.

Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said it’s more appropriate to compare private-sector job growth now.

In 2011, the state was purposefully ""trying to reduce public-sector employment and the public sector in general,"" he said. ""Whereas in 2004 it was sort of the Wild West, 40 percent of the total growth that year was in the public sector.""

As we’ve noted in previous rulings, it’s generally wrong to assign full credit or blame for job growth or job losses to specific individuals. While the governor and bipartisan reformers may have had a hand in creating more jobs other factors are at work, including the nation’s recovery  from a job-destroying recession.

Our ruling

A group that supports the governor  released a video ad that said with Christie and bipartisan reformers, New Jersey had ""the most job growth in 11 years.""

The state gained more jobs overall last year than in seven years -- not 11 years. In 2004, the state added 37,700 jobs. In 2011, we added 36,400 jobs.

Public-sector growth boosted job gains in 2004, while last year the state added jobs despite a decrease in government employment    .

The ad doesn’t make a distinction in the types of jobs gained, but a spokesman said it was referring to private-sector employment. Last year, New Jersey had the most private-sector job growth in 11 years.

Overall, we rate this statement Half True.

Deal: Tech company needs 200 skilled trade workers
","
Think twice about going to a four-year college, young Georgians. Gov. Nathan Deal wants you to Go Build.

People are struggling to find work in today’s jobs-poor economy, Deal said Jan. 10 as he outlined his 2012 agenda during the governor’s yearly State of the State address. Yet jobs are abundant in skilled trades, which don’t require four-year degrees.  

Deal’s solution: Go Build Georgia, a major jobs and education initiative that makes students aware of skilled trades and helps train them.

""Right here in metro Atlanta, Siemens has been unable to fill approximately 200 skilled trade positions in the fields of manufacturing automation, health care technology, transportation systems and technical service,"" Deal said.

They’re having trouble filling 200 open positions? Right here in metro Atlanta?

The state’s unemployment rate is stuck near 10 percent. Please, tell us more, we asked the governor’s office.

""Skilled trade"" positions are jobs that don’t require a bachelor’s degree but do require specialized knowledge and training. They include commercial construction workers, pipe fitters, draftsmen and electricians.    

A governor’s office spokeswoman referred us to Siemens for more details about the positions. The company posts job openings on its website.

Some 130 positions were listed for Siemens’ locations in Alpharetta, Atlanta, Norcross and five other locations in the metro area. This number was short of Deal’s estimate by about 70 positions.

Siemens spokeswoman Camille Johnston said that is because not all open jobs are posted. Some are only advertised within the company. Other listings are taken off the website if they have enough candidates. A few have one listing but multiple openings.

A difference of 70 positions seemed high to us, but her explanations did not seem unreasonable. We opted to take them at face value.  

Then we pored over the online listings.

For the most part, they did not advertise positions in the skilled trades. More than 60 percent explicitly required at least a four-year degree, and many of these listings sought candidates with majors in science or technology. One posting was for an attorney.

Even positions that appeared open to candidates without bachelor’s degrees favored employees with four-year degrees or were typically held by people with four-year degrees, according to the listings. One preferred candidates with a Master of Business Administration or other post-graduate degree.

In fact, we found only 12 posted listings that did not require or favor candidates without bachelor’s degrees. That’s about 10 percent of the online jobs listings.  

Most of them were squarely in the ""skilled trade"" category. For instance, two were for heating, ventilation and air conditioning workers. One was for a draftsman, and three sought field service workers.

Two of them were not. One Atlanta position was for a training assistant who would handle tasks such as billing and scheduling. Another was for an administrative assistant in Roswell.  

We emailed and called Siemens to ask why most of the listed positions were not for skilled trade workers, but we received no response.

Deal spokeswoman Stephanie Mayfield said that regardless of the actual numbers, the state needs skilled workers, and the governor’s office is glad Siemens offered to work with Georgia to solve this problem.  

Siemens may be struggling to fill some 200 jobs in metro Atlanta, but the overwhelming majority are not skilled trade positions as Deal claimed. They’re geared to candidates with bachelor’s or post-graduate degrees.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says he eliminated Wisconsin’s $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes
","
In a new campaign ad in heavy rotation on a television near you, Gov. Scott Walker looks directly into the camera to repeat the heart of his message as a potential recall election looms.

""When I ran for governor, I promised to rein in spending, eliminate the deficit and hold the line on taxes. And you know what? That’s exactly what we did. We had to make some tough decisions, but thankfully, we wiped out a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes.""

Walker makes frequent use of that last phrase -- ""we wiped out a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes"" -- and did so again on Jan. 25, 2012 in his ’state of the state’ address.

Between the Walk-O-Meter (the tax question) and the Truth-O-Meter (deficit-related items) we’ve looked at aspects of this claim.

But we haven’t looked at how Walker is intertwining the two in his new anti-recall push. And it’s our most-frequently requested item of late from readers, mainly because of a new twist:

Walker’s own administration recently told the federal government the state will be left with a deficit at the end of the two-year budget.

So which is it?

Did Walker eliminate the deficit -- and do so without raising taxes -- or not?

On the deficit question, the answer is in the accounting.

Stay with us. It will be painless.

Let’s start with the bottom line: The state constitution requires a balanced budget and it has -- under Democrats and Republicans alike -- long used what is known as a cash accounting system in its budgeting.

That approach is used to generate the deficit number that politicians, the media, budget officials and others generally talk about. It was the basis for Walker to say in spring 2011 he faced an estimated $3.6 billion shortfall while putting together his first budget. (Critics argued he exaggerated the number, but a major deficit was real.)

But there is another way to look at the state’s books, a more stringent measure and one Walker himself cited in his bid to succeed Democratic Gov.  Jim Doyle.

In the 2010 race, Walker made an explicit promise, noted on his campaign website to ""require the use of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to balance every state budget, just as we require every local government and school district to do.""

This is known as the accrual accounting method, something also used by publicly traded companies. On the Walk-O-Meter, we rated this a Promise Broken. Walker did not use the GAAP approach on his first budget.

Indeed, under that approach, the state shows a $3 billion GAAP deficit each of the next two years. And that is the new source of confusion.

It was the GAAP standard Walker pointed to on Dec. 29, 2011, when his administration argued to the federal government the state should be allowed to make further cuts to state health programs. Why? Well, that measure showed a deficit in the state budget.

To be sure, Democrats didn’t complain about the broken promise at the time -- balancing the budget by the GAAP method would have required much deeper cuts. And even now, as they note Walker is trying to have it both ways, no one is suggesting the state reopen the budget and cut billions more.

Why are the two numbers so different?

The cash accounting method allows the state to use maneuvers to bring the budget into balance, such as pushing current liabilities into future budgets or counting anticipated revenue before it materializes.

Think of the $2,000 you have on a credit card from buying a big-screen HDTV and sound system for the party room. GAAP takes that future liability into account now.

""It’s sort of the difference  between the federal debt and the federal deficit -- one is an accumulated figure over many years and the other is a one-year number,"" said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research group.

But the fact a GAAP deficit exists doesn’t wipe out what Walker and lawmakers did in balancing the budget according to the official, recognized method used by the state and its Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which both sides acknowledge as the official neutral scorekeeper of such matters.

And it’s clear to us Walker in the new ad -- and in other venues -- is talking about the traditional cash shortfall deficit. He refers to choices he made during the budget process. And he refers to the $3.6 billion number, which was used frequently in early 2011 to describe the size of the budget shortfall.

In 2011, we rated False separate statements by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore and state Rep. Marc Pocan that Walker ""manufactured"" or ""invented"" the $3.6 billion shortfall. The number is squishy, outside experts told us, but a defensible estimate of the challenge he faced.

So in the ad, Walker is on solid ground to say he eliminating a $3.6 billion deficit.

This leaves us with the tax aspect of the claim.

In an earlier Walk-O-Meter item we rated as Promise Broken Walker’s pledge to ""oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.""

But in the ad, the claim is worded somewhat differently -- that the deficit was eliminated ""without raising taxes.""

Overall, Walker’s budget included a modest $34 million reduction, mainly through business tax breaks. His plan included $83 million in tax cuts, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, but that was offset by $49 million in tax increases.

The bureau determined that Walker included three tax increases in the budget. As we noted in our Walk-O-Meter item on the promise:

""The largest involved a reduction in a state tax credit for low-income working families, known as the earned income credit. A tax credit reduces the amount of tax you owe.

""In this case, the earned income tax credit is in place for both state and federal taxes. It’s refundable, so individuals with little or no income tax liability may still receive the credit.

""A second tax increase, the fiscal bureau said, is stopping the inflationary adjustment of the state’s Homestead Tax Credit -- the property tax break that appears as a credit on income tax forms for low-income homeowners and renters. The bureau calculated that change would increase taxes by an estimated $8.1 million.""

Walker has disputed the characterization of the credit change as a tax increase, saying that decreasing a tax credit is reducing spending, not increasing taxes.

But outside experts, including one with the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance and another with the Wisconsin Budget Project, told us they considered it a tax increase.

And even though the language in Walker’s ad is somewhat different than his 2010 pledge, it still ignores those tax increases in his budget.

The bottom line on Walker’s claim of eliminating a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes: It’s a mixed message.

Ron Paul says when Republicans were in power, they expanded government role in health care
","
Years before ""Obamacare,"" congressional Republicans saw political gold in expanding government's role in health care by adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul says the ""Part D"" drug benefit is a reminder that the GOP sometimes can't resist the temptation of big government.

""I'm not all that optimistic (about repealing the Democratic health care law) because when we did have the chance, when the Republicans were in charge, they actually expanded government health care with the prescription drug program,"" Paul said in a July 16, 2011, interview with the Nashua Telegraph in Derry, New Hampshire. ""We've got a long way to go on that.""

Because memories can be short, we thought it would be worthwhile to explore whether Paul was right that the GOP was responsible for such a big increase in government.

A bit of background: The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 was an effort by President George W. Bush in his first term to address a major gap in the senior citizen health care program -- a lack of drug coverage. Bush's political advisers saw the drug plan as a way for Bush to broaden his appeal with seniors.

Early on, the drug benefit had bipartisan support, although many Democrats later abandoned the effort, saying it provided too big a handout to the pharmaceutical industry without requiring enough competition.

A check of the rolls confirmed that the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress at the time of the vote in 2003 and that the bill passed with strong GOP support.

According to voting records, the GOP held a 229 to 205 majority in the House at the time of the Nov. 22 vote, and of the 229 Republicans, 204 voted in favor. Across the hall in the Senate, Republicans held a 51 to 48 majority on Nov.  25 when 42 of the 51 GOP Senators supported the bill. Nine Republican Senators voted against.

In the Senate, only 11 of 47 Democrats approved the bill, with 36 against and two abstaining. And, in the House, only 16 Democrats voted in favor, with 185 against.

Of the current presidential field, Paul voted against the bill, while then-U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican, voted in favor. (We recently checked his claim that the program was coming in below projections.)

The bill had roots in previous Democratic proposals, said Jack Hoadley, a policy analyst at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. But ""the version of the drug benefit that passed was certainly the Republican approach -- competing private plans, no government regulation,"" Hoadley said. ""There wasn't a lot of compromising.""

So Paul is right about the Republicans being the driving force.

And how much did it expand government? Hugely. The new drug benefit was used by 34.5 million beneficiaries in 2010, and that number is projected to reach 40.5 million in 2015. (Most were already enrolled in Medicare.)  

Through 2010, Medicare Part D had cost $203 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The program is expected to cost another $391 billion through 2015, according to CBO projections.

""It was certainly not the first time that Congress tried to improve the system of private plans within Medicare. But it’s fair to say with the addition of the drug benefit, it was the biggest expansion of the program since the beginning,"" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group.

""(It) was filling a major gap that existed since the beginning of the program,"" he said. ""That was a real, fundamental change.""

Our ruling:

So Paul is right on both counts. It was a Republican bill that passed with strong Republican support. And it dramatically increased government. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/25/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-when-republicans-were-power-they-exp/

Arianna Huffington says U.S. debt ceiling rules are unusual internationally
","On the July 24, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Arianna Huffington, a liberal commentator and founder of the Huffington Post, sought to provide viewers with a bit of historical context on the debt ceiling.

The issue was pertinent because Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in high-stakes negotiations over whether and how to raise the limit on how much the federal government can legally borrow. Republicans are using the looming deadline as leverage to cut government outlays, while Democrats say that blocking an increase risks the nation’s creditworthiness, potentially complicating an already delicate economic situation.

Huffington focused her comments on how unusual the U.S. rules for debt limits are.

""I think this a completely artificial crisis,"" Huffington said. ""Most countries have no debt ceiling. We (established) the debt ceiling in the First World War. It's been raised dozens of times. …""

Amanpour pointed out, ""But the thing is, it is a crisis now."":

Huffington replied, ""But it is a crisis because they made it a crisis. It's not a real crisis. We have many, many real crises. We have a job crisis. We have a growth crisis. We have a deficit crisis. We have a human capital crisis. We have an infrastructure crisis. We are not handling these crises now. We are handling a completely artificial crisis.""

We wondered whether the U.S. system is really as unusual as Huffington suggested. So we looked into it.

First, some background. The debt limit, often called a ""debt ceiling,"" sets a cap on how much the U.S. Treasury may borrow from the public and from other governmental agencies. Huffington is correct that the statutory limit on federal debt began in 1917, in a bill that helped finance the U.S. entry into World War I, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Once the nation’s outstanding debt nears the debt ceiling, Congress must vote on, and the president must sign, a bill that raises the limit. Huffington is also correct that this has happened repeatedly over the years -- more than 90 times since 1940.

If Congress and the president fail to agree to a debt ceiling increase, the government risks defaulting on payments to at least some of its creditors -- a development that independent ratings agencies have already made clear would lead to lowering the U.S. government’s usually top-tier credit rating. Many experts say that a default followed by a lowering of the U.S. credit rating could increase the costs of borrowing for all Americans and harm the fragile economic recovery.

So that’s how the U.S. system works. How unusual is it? The first conclusion we drew from our research is that there has been no comprehensive study of how every country manages and limits its government’s debt level. So we have drawn inferences from a handful of studies that are more anecdotal than complete.

In a report published last February, the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, described the U.S. system as fairly unusual, since the U.S. debt ceiling process moves independently of the general budgeting process.

""The U.S. statutory debt limit is an uncommon attribute not shared by most sovereign debt issuers in that it is not tied to the budgetary process. As a result, when the government adopts a budget, the financing of the expenditures authorized is not automatically assured. While lawmakers in April approved spending appropriations for fiscal year 2011 (after continuing resolutions had allowed the government to operate since the beginning of the fiscal year), about 40 percent of this spending must be funded by borrowing. Borrowing is subject to the debt limit, with the current limit having been approved in February 2010. There is, therefore, no direct connection between the spending levels authorized by Congress and the ability of the government to fund this spending.""

More common, the GAO said, are systems in which the passage of the annual budget includes provisions to approve borrowing authority.

""For example, in Canada, the Ministry of Finance is provided with a fixed amount that it is authorized to borrow for the fiscal year,"" the GAO wrote. ""When necessary, the Ministry of Finance can request increased borrowing authority from the executive branch of government to fund unforeseen borrowing needs. In Sweden, the legislature approves borrowing authority annually; however, it is limited (by) purpose — to finance current deficits, provide loans, and redeem national debt, for example — rather than by amount.""

In several other countries, including the United Kingdom and New Zealand, treasury officials are provided with broad authority to borrow as needed, the GAO wrote. In a parliamentary system like the U.K., the same party always controls the executive branch and the legislative branch, limiting the kinds of disputes that emerge frequently in a system with checks and balances like that in the U.S.

Some countries don’t have a debt ceiling but rather have targets that cap debt based on mathematical formulas.

Switzerland, the GAO wrote, has a constitutional ""debt brake"" that limits expenditures to expected revenue plus adjustments for the state of the business cycle. Meanwhile, Germany has a constitutional amendment that requires that structural deficits not exceed 0.35 percent of Gross Domestic Product. Both have exceptions for economic emergencies -- another difference from the U.S. system. Sweden’s target is a net surplus of 1 percent of GDP over the course of the business cycle. Chile also uses this sort of target.

The European Union has set a target of keeping gross government debt to 60 percent of GDP and budget deficits to 3 percent of GDP. But these limits are not binding and have not been thoroughly enforced.

The only country examined by the GAO and other analysts that has a system similar to that used in the U.S. is Denmark. However, a Danish official told the GAO that the procedure has inspired a lot less brinksmanship than the U.S. process. ""The limit is set high enough that it does not impede debt managers’ ability to issue debt,"" the official said.

Experts we spoke to agreed that the U.S. system is, if not unique, then at least quite unusual.

""Restrictions of that general form are very uncommon, and none seem to approach the rigidity of the U.S. provision,"" said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.

So where does this leave us? While other countries -- with the exception of Denmark -- don’t have a debt ceiling mechanism exactly like the U.S. has, most countries that have been studied do use either mathematical targets or require approval of new borrowing authority whenever a budget is passed. So it’s not as if other countries have no debt limits -- they simply limit their debt using different tools.

We think there’s validity in Huffington’s underlying point -- that the U.S. system of imposing a debt ceiling is unusual and that it’s more arbitrary than most other systems.

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz says nonpartisan CBO faults Bush tax cuts for debt crisis
","
If you watch TV news, you've probably seen clips of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's speech from the House floor July 19, 2011, on the Republican ""cut, cap and balance"" plan to slash the federal debt — it's the one that prompted fellow South Florida Rep. Allen West to call her vile and despicable.

But you may have missed a line about the 2001 and 2003 George W. Bush tax cuts that raised our curiosity.

Here's a recap.

Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, argued during House debate that deep spending cuts required by the Cut, Cap and Balance Act of 2011 would ""end Medicare as we know it,"" increasing costs for Medicare beneficiaries. She added it was ""unbelievable"" that West, a Republican tea-party favorite, would support it, given the number of South Florida seniors. She urged colleagues to reject the ""reckless bill"" for something that instead ""engages us all in shared sacrifice"" — for example, legislation that also targeted the Bush tax breaks. 

West then fired off a name-calling e-mail, setting off a days-long public spat that echoed Washington's partisan wrangling over raising the nation's debt limit. (There's more to say about Wasserman Schultz and West's tumultuous history, but that's not our focus here.)

Many conservatives oppose any debt limit increase unless lawmakers cut spending to reduce the deficit, enact ""enforceable"" spending caps and pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The GOP-led House ultimately passed the Cut, Cap and Balance Act; the Democratic Senate tabled it July 22, effectively killing the plan. Officials expect the debt ceiling to be reached Aug. 2.

As negotiations continue, we were interested in Wasserman Schultz's claim on the House floor about the buildup of the federal debt:

""The nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office, has said that the No. 1 policy decision that brought us to the need to prevent the nation from defaulting on our debt for the first time in history were the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans.""

We wondered if the Congressional Budget Office — which has a mandate to provide ""objective, impartial analysis"" for lawmakers and doesn't make policy recommendations — really said that? 
Warning sign No. 1: When we asked Wasserman Schultz's communications director, Jonathan Beeton about her statement, he provided us not with a CBO report, but with work done by a liberal think-tank, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Warning sign No. 2: When we contacted the CBO, associate director for communications Deborah Kilroe provided us not with something that sounded like a source for Wasserman Schultz's claim, but with a table of numbers. The table — published within a May 2011 CBO report — does not include a qualitative analysis to support Wasserman Schultz's statement.

Instead, the table assigns dollar values to the major revenue and spending decisions that took the country from budget surpluses to budget deficits.

On the revenue side, the Bush tax cuts — formally the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 — were the biggest chunk of lost income: $1.5 trillion. That dwarfs all other revenue changes, including tax cuts in the 2009 stimulus. The 2001 tax cut alone is bigger than any other single change, representing $1.2 trillion from 2002-11.

On the spending side, the only item in CBO's table bigger than the 2001 tax cut — or the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts together — was lawmakers' discretionary spending. So, the impact of tax cuts in 2001 and 2003? $1.5 trillion. The impact of discretionary spending? $2.9 trillion. 
Of course, discretionary spending likely represented a series of ""policy decisions,"" individually perhaps smaller than the impact of the tax cuts. And that's exactly what Beeton of Wasserman Schultz's office argued: ""The biggest legislative number is for discretionary changes. The 2001 Bush tax cut is the second-biggest,"" he said. ""However, the discretionary number is an aggregation of several different policies enacted at different times. ... In terms of a single piece of legislation's impact on the deficit, the Bush 2001 tax cuts probably still wins the prize for generating the biggest deficit increase."" 
In short, the May 2011 CBO report doesn't say what Wasserman Schultz said, that ""the No. 1 policy decision that brought us to the need to prevent the nation from defaulting on our debt for the first time in history were the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003."" But the CBO numbers back that claim up, Beeton argues. 
So does an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Beeton said. (The study actually widens its analysis beyond the Bush tax cuts, ascribing the bulk of recent and projected deficits to the economic downturn, the Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.) 
""Her statement clearly has a lot of strength to it,"" added Bob Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. (Editor's note: We updated the description of the Tax Policy Center on July 28, 2011.) 
But another think-tank that also analyzes CBO data, the business-backed Tax Foundation, interpreted the same CBO data differently. The Tax Foundation's Scott Hodge and Will McBride make spirited arguments that spending, not tax cuts, provides a more potent explanation for America's debt crisis. 

The discrepancy in the analyses explains the central problem with Wasserman Schultz's claim. 

The CBO provides data. Think-tank analysts provide varying interpretations of the data. Wasserman Schultz got up before fellow lawmakers, repeated a think-tank interpretation and passed it off as the objective stance of CBO. (She even slowed down to make sure we understood her source: ""The nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office ..."")

What does the Truth-O-Meter make of this? 

Wasserman Schultz said that ""the nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office, has said that the No. 1 policy decision that brought us to the need to prevent the nation from defaulting on our debt for the first time in history were the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003."" 
The CBO never actually said that, but data from a May 2011 CBO report can reasonably support Wasserman Schultz's position. The CBO found that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts resulted in the biggest revenue drop since 2001. Experts say the cuts were hefty enough they likely outweighed individual spending decisions.

Wisconsin Rep. Jennifer Shilling says the state’s 2011-’13 state budget cut public school funding by $1.6 billion
","
As the historic Wisconsin Senate recall elections drive toward their end, Democrats are working overtime to highlight what they consider lowlights in the Republican-drafted state budget.

Cuts to public school funding are near the top of their list, with a chorus of critics repeating an eye-popping figure: $1.6 billion.

One recall candidate, state Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), complains on her legislative website that the Republican budget ""cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion statewide...""

Shilling is trying to unseat state Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse).

Did the two-year budget really take that big a bite out of schools?

Shilling and Democrats point to statements by state schools Superintendent Tony Evers and a report by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Evers is an elected official who runs the state Department of Public Instruction.

Both present the $1.6 billion figure -- but do it in tandem with a second, much lower figure of $800 million to $900 million.

Here is an important note: Shilling’s claim of $1.6 billion relates to the new revenue limits the budget put on local school districts.

(Shilling is also critical of the cut of $792 million in direct state aid to schools. That’s been the subject of TV ads against the GOP senators, the cut of ""nearly $800 million."" But that cut is separate from the $1.6 billion claim we are looking at here. Shilling’s office acknowledges that point.)

This may all sound arcane, but ultimately the revenue limits determine how much your schools can take in from local property taxes and state school aids -- and how much money gets into the classroom.

Let’s look back in time to figure this out.

As they worked to close a big budget shortfall projected for 2011-’13, Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature cut direct state aid to schools (the $792 million). Then they greatly restricted schools’ ability to raise property taxes to make up for the lost aid. The goal was to be sure a savings at the state level was not eaten up by higher local taxes.

It was not the first time the state squeezed school aid.

In 2009, Gov. Jim Doyle and Democrats who controlled the Capitol enacted an aid trim in the 2009-’11 budget. They also slowed the growth in how much schools could raise in property taxes.

But the Dems left a little gift for schools.

They wrote into state law a provision on the property tax limits. They directed the next Legislature to re-set the revenue limits in the 2011-’13 budget to what they were before they were tightened.

Think of it as your boss promising you a catch-up raise in writing two years from now … even if it’s not certain your boss will be around then.

Indeed, Doyle did not run again, many of the Democrats are gone and the the party lost both chambers in the November 2010 election.

And the new bosses, Walker and legislative Republicans, turned to school cuts to help balance the budget. They also agreed that they couldn’t accept the Democrat-set limits, and they put in place a real cut in both state school aid and allowable property tax growth.

Now, back to the future.

Today, Democrats such as Shilling are saying the budget ""cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion."" That is, schools can take in $1.6 billion less over two years as a result of the revenue limits.

They get that by comparing the stricter limits enacted by the GOP to the increase Doyle and the Democrats had built into the budget for 2011-’13.

But that can be a skewed way to measure a cut.

Actual school spending from one year to the next will not go down $1.6 billion.

The year-to-year comparison gets you to the smaller number -- an $800 million to $900 million-plus loss of potential resources for schools.

Two education financing sources we turned to -- Russ Kava of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and officials at the state Department of Public Instruction -- said their agencies choose to present both perspectives. They said they did this because of past practice and the value of showing both the actual impact as well as the larger swing from the Democrat-desired limits to the new budget.

A May 31, 2011 statement from Evers put it this way: ""Last week the Joint Finance Committee, on a 12-4 vote, cut public schools by $1.6 billion compared to current law and over $850 million compared to current levels by making the first significant reduction to revenue caps ever.""

In making her case, Shilling, as well as fellow Democratic recall candidate Shelly Moore in River Falls, cherry-picks the higher number.

There are a couple of problems with that.

One is that when you look at what the state budget actually saved on K-12 education compared with the last budget, experts say it’s close to the $800 million to $900 million.

Second, even the lower figure (the $800 million to $900 million) is only an estimate, and one that assumes that school districts would have ""taxed to the max"" without the limits.

That’s unlikely, based on recent history, according to Andrew Reschovsky, a University of Wisconsin-Madison economist who publishes reports on school funding. That means even the $800 million to $900 million figure could be high, and underscores the importance of presenting multiple perspectives.

Reschovsky prefers to study the actual year-to-year change, which yields the smaller number. He says the average person just looks at the bottom line difference, not what might have been.

Remember that promised pay raise from your boss?

If your salary was cut instead, your household budget would be reduced only in the actual difference -- not the theoretical difference, with the promised raise included.

Democrats argue that schools planned on the restoration of the 2009 cut because it was in statute. But others say the handwriting was on the wall long ago.

Reschovsky, who describes himself as an ardent support of public education, said it’s hard to argue that any governor could have avoided some cuts to education given the size of the budget gap.

Finally, there is the issue of the spending side of school budgets.

Along with the reduction in state aid and tougher tax limits, Walker and the GOP provided local school districts with a savings opportunity. Their limits on collective bargaining by public employees allow the school districts to require employees to pay more for health insurance and pensions. The ""tools,"" as Walkers calls them, have allowed some -- but not all -- districts to offset the reduction in spending on education, at least for next year, the Journal Sentinel reported.

So from some school districts’ perspective, the state budget giveth as well as taketh away -- and Shilling cited only the taketh away part.

Let’s put away the calculator.

Like some other Democrats, Shilling claims the 2011-’13 state budget cut $1.6 billion from local schools. The number comes from respected sources, but she uses it out of context, leaving out the much lower companion figure of around $800 million to $900 million that experts typically present along with the $1.6 billion as a measure of the true year-to-year loss.

The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores the reality behind the lower figure. That fits the definition for Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/25/jennifer-shilling/wisconsin-jennifer-shilling-state-budget-cut-publi/

Armstrong changes stance on taking campaign money from electric utilities
","
With TV cameras whirring, House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong strode to the door of his enemy on July 21 and proclaimed there is a conspiracy against him.

In a news conference in front of Appalacahian Power Co.’s Roanoke headquarters, Armstrong, D-Henry, said electric utility companies have indirectly funneled $100,000 to his opponent in this fall’s election -- Del. Charles Poindexter, R-Franklin County.

The electric companies, he charged, donated cash to four Republican leaders who then gave the money to the Southside Victory Fund, a political action committee that benefits Poindexter. Armstrong has been fighting electric companies for several years, saying they are taking advantage of weak regulations to gain exorbitant rate increases. He said Poindexter’s campaign contributions suggest the Republican will be friendly to the power companies.

Poindexter said Armstrong has scaled ""the height of hypocrisy"" in condemning others for accepting money from the electric industry. So we thought we’d look into the affair and see if the minority leader’s position on the taking contributions from the utilities has changed.

Armstrong has unsuccessfully introduced bills during the last two years that would give the State Corporation Commission greater regulation of electric rates. Most of Armstrong’s ire has been directed at Apco, which serves his Southside constituents and has sought 14 increases over the last four years that have raised residential rates by 42 percent.

At the news conference, Armstrong promised to continue fighting Apco and portrayed Poindexter as the power company’s pet.

""What it says is that Apco thinks they’re going to get favorable treatment out of my opponent, certainly more so than they’re going to get from me,"" Armstrong said. ""You know what, they’re right.""

Armstrong pointed to the campaign finance records of Gov. Bob McDonnell, Speaker Bill Howell, House Majority Leader Kirk Cox, and Del. Bill Janis. The records show a correlation between sums each Republican received from electric companies and the amounts he gave to Poindexter’s PAC.   
But suppose we go a step further and conclude -- as Armstrong does -- that this is an open-and-shut case of money being funneled from the utilities to Poindexter. Does that prove the Republican is a reliable friend of electric companies?

Well, let’s go back a few years and consider the case of another legislator who accepted money from electric companies. His name is Ward Armstrong.

Between 2007 and 2010, Armstrong received $100,750 in contributions from electric companies according to the Virginia Public Access Project. The Majority Leader accepted $81,000 from Dominion Power, $5,250 from Appalachian Power, and $14,500 from other electric utilities and industry lobbyists.

How does Armstrong square his past acceptance of contributions from electric companies with his condemnation of Poindexter for possibly receiving utility money?

Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, said her boss stopped taking contributions from electric companies in late 2009. ""Ward hasn’t accepted any money from them since he realized that they were taking advantage of state laws to get as much money as they can,"" she said.

Armstrong did receive one last contribution -- $250 -- from Apco in January 2010. Wilker said the minority leader gave the money to a charity, Grace Network of Martinsville.

Wilker said Armstrong is not turning down money from the utilities, it just doesn’t come in anymore.  And if it did, Armstrong said he would take it and donate it to a charity that helps Southside residents pay their electric bills.

So Armstrong, who once campaigned with money from electric companies, will no longer do so. And he criticizes an opponent who may have received indirect contributions from the utilities. 
Although Armstrong has his reasons, a shift has clearly occurred. Full Flop!",/factchecks/2011/jul/25/ward-armstrong/armstrong-changes-stance-taking-campaign-money-ele/

David Dewhurst says the 2011 Legislature required Congress to pass balanced-budget amendment to U.S. Constitution
","
Offering himself as a fiscally conservative candidate for the U.S. Senate, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst says in his opening campaign video that his record shows he knows how to hold the line on spending.

Washington, he continues, is addicted to debt. In contrast, he adds, ""This past (legislative) session, we passed out of the Legislature a resolution requiring Congress to pass a balanced-budget amendment to the (U.S.) Constitution.""

An online news search indicated that Dewhurst, who declared his candidacy July 19, was referring to House Concurrent Resolution 18, which the House and Senate advanced in May. The House vote for the resolution was 115-17, the Senate vote 28-3.

The resolution doesn’t require Congress to do anything. It states, though, that given large annual federal deficits and the escalating national debt, and the failure of Congress to forward a balanced-budget constitutional amendment to the states, ""action must be taken to restore fiscal responsibility.""

It goes on to say that a ""balanced-budget amendment would require the government not to spend more than it receives in revenues and compel lawmakers to carefully consider choices about spending and taxes; by encouraging spending control and discouraging deficit spending, a balanced-budget amendment will help put the nation on the path to lasting prosperity.""

The resolution closes by stating the Legislature ""respectfully urges"" Congress to ""propose and submit to the states for ratification"" a constitutional amendment providing that except during a war declared by Congress or other ""national emergency,"" total federal appropriations in a fiscal year may not exceed the year’s estimated federal revenue. The next section calls for the resolution to be forwarded to Congress to be placed in the Congressional Record.

For perspective, we contacted the resolution’s author, Rep. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, who said that while no legislative resolution can make Congress do anything, ""political tides have been spread by much less than a resolution backed by a legislature that represents over 25 million people.""

Creighton said he thinks his resolution impresses on Congress that there’s reason to bring up the amendment. ""In the aggregate, state by state by state, these legislatures sending these strong statements of political will"" have an effect, he said.

Creighton said he’s not troubled by Dewhurst saying the resolution requires Congress to approve the amendment.

""I don’t believe anybody’s interpretation is that Congress has to act on it,"" Creighton said, adding that even a novice observer wouldn’t conclude that a Texas-rooted resolution amounts to ""an iron-clad requirement"" that Congress act. ""It’s kind of a gotcha that doesn’t matter,"" he said.

By the way, Congress cannot directly amend the Constitution. Article V says an amendment can originate by two-thirds’ votes of the U.S. House and Senate, but still must be ratified by three-fourths of the states’ legislatures. Alternatively, the Constitution can be amended at a convention called by two-thirds of the states’ legislatures.

In February, after the Texas Senate passed a different version of the call for a balanced-budget amendment, Dewhurst issued a statement characterizing the resolution as urging prompt action, noting that it takes ratification by three-fourths of the states for a constitutional amendment to stick.

In contrast, Dewhurst’s campaign video leaves the misimpression Congress can, by itself, change the Constitution. It also misrepresents the Texas resolution by saying it ""requires"" Congress to affix the balanced-budget amendment. But the spirit of his message — that Texas legislators are aboard with the constitutional change — is accurate.

The press release trumpeted reasons why the streetcar is good for Atlanta, including this one:

""[T]he project is expected to create an estimated 930 jobs during construction and more than 5,600 jobs over the next 20 years.""

Wait a second. Didn’t the Truth-O-Meter debunk a similar streetcar job creation claim in March?

Indeed, Democrat U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who represents the district where the streetcar will be built, said in a newsletter to constituents that building and running the streetcar is projected to create 1,399 jobs -- 460 to run it, and 939 to build it.

The newsletter cited figures in the grant proposal that won the streetcar more than $47 million in federal money.

Experts and civil servants came up with the numbers and vetted them, so Lewis’ staff thought they were safe to use.

They weren’t.  We ruled Lewis’ claim False. Those jobs weren’t actual positions. They were ""job years.""

""Job years"" means one job lasting for one year. So if a single position lasts five years, it counts as five ""job years.""

But Lewis’ newsletter described the ""job years"" as ""jobs,"" which would mislead typical readers. People think of ""jobs"" as actual positions, so constituents would think the streetcar would create more jobs than experts actually estimated.   

Since the FTA’s recent press release uses the same numbers, its statement has similar problems.  

The FTA said its 5,600 jobs figure includes the 930 construction jobs, plus those needed to run the streetcar and positions created when new residences and businesses pop up along the route. The agency, like Lewis, got its numbers from Atlanta’s grant application.

(The FTA’s 930 construction jobs count is very close to the 939 the grant application used, so we won’t count this difference against the FTA.)

The FTA’s press release portrays the construction jobs estimate accurately. It will take about one year to build the streetcar, so for this phase of the project, one job year does equal one actual job.

But that doesn’t mean 930 people are projected to build the streetcar line, and the jobs aren’t all for locals.
   
This is the construction phase’s ""total employment"" figure, which means the number of people who would be employed for construction, plus two other types of jobs created by the project: those to make materials such as steel to construct the line, and those created when workers spend their earnings on a new stereo or a package of cheese puffs.

Planners expect to employ 467 workers for streetcar construction. The rest would be making steel, cheese puffs and the like -- often outside the Atlanta area.

Now let’s deal with the rest of the jobs cited in the FTA release. These are the posts planners think the project will create over the next 20 years: 460 needed to operate the streetcar, plus about 4,200 created when the line spurs economic growth.  

When PolitiFact Georgia researched Lewis’ statement, we were unable to come up with enough evidence to evaluate job estimates for when the streetcar brings new business to the neighborhood.

But we could evaluate the claim that 460 jobs are needed to operate the streetcar.

This number also represents ""job years,"" not actual positions. It will actually take an estimated 23 positions to run the streetcar, lasting over 20 years. In other words, this jobs figure is 20 times too high.

How do we rule on the FTA?

As we wrote earlier, a typical person thinks of ""jobs"" as actual positions, not ""job years."" And while experts may understand that the FTA’s jobs figures do not represent actual jobs, your average citizen would not.  

In fact, it will take an estimated 467 jobs to construct the line, plus 23 jobs that last 20 years or longer to run the streetcar. Experts think the remaining 4,600 jobs will be for those who produce materials needed to build the line or products workers purchase with their earnings, as well as employees of new businesses the streetcar brings to surrounding neighborhoods.

This means that when the Federal Transit Administration announced the streetcar project would ""create an estimated 930 jobs during construction,"" totaling more than 5,600 over the next 20 years, it gave a misleadingly high impression of the actual positions needed to construct and run it.

If public officials keep exaggerating the number of jobs created by this project, PoiltiFact Georgia will keep turning up the heat.

State Sen. Raymond Lesniak says juvenile crime rates triple from 3 to 6 p.m. on school days
","
In his bid to restore $3 million in funding for an organization that sponsors after-school programs, state Sen. Raymond Lesniak said juvenile crime rates triple between 3 and 6 p.m.

Lesniak (D-Union) argued that after-school programs, in general, keep children out of trouble and without such initiatives, crime rates would rise.

If New Jersey After 3 -- the organization Lesniak was trying to restore funding for -- shuttered its programs, ""five thousand students in 13 school districts will be left unsupervised during the most dangerous time for children: 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., during which time juvenile crime rates triple and children are most likely to experiment with risky behavior,"" Lesniak said during a July 12 Senate hearing. ""The effects of putting more children on the streets at a time when urban districts are forced to cut social services and layoff public safety officers will lead, most definitely, to an increase in crime.""

PolitiFact New Jersey researched Lesniak’s claim about juvenile crime rates and found that while the statistic comes from data nearly two decades old, his overall point is still sound.

Lesniak got his information from NJ After 3, which mainly serves elementary and middle school children in urban areas.  Mark Valli, the head of NJ After 3, cited Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a Washington, D.C.-based anti-crime organization.

A 2000 study from Fight Crime: Invest in Kids said ""in the hour after the school bell rings … violent juvenile crime suddenly triples"" and ""on school days, the prime time for violent juvenile crime is from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.""  

Data used for the study shows that from 1 to 2 p.m. the percent of violent juvenile crime occurring was 3.7 percent. Between 3 and 4 p.m., the rate had more than tripled to 12.1 percent.

But the study is based on a 1997 study by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, a juvenile justice research organization, that analyzed the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System, or NIBRS, data from 1991 to 1993. The data for those years came from eight states -- not New Jersey -- and includes all offenders younger than 18. Violent crimes in that study included murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

New Jersey does not participate in the NIBRS and the state police do not specifically distinguish juvenile crimes by the time they occurred.

Still, analysis of more recent NIBRS data on violent juvenile crime shows a spike after school.

The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, a division of the U.S. Department of Justice, analyzed 2008 NIBRS data and found that juvenile violent crime, including violent sexual assault and simple assault, peaks at 3 p.m. on school days.

The data -- represented as offenders per 1,000 juvenile violent crime offenders  -- climbs from 39.3 between 1 and 2 p.m to 71.7 between 3 and 4 p.m. -- less than double.

The juvenile justice office also notes that though the number of school days in a year is about equal to the number of nonschool days, 63 percent of violent crimes committed by juveniles occur on school days. Also, 19 percent of juvenile violent crimes occur between 3 and 7 p.m. on school days.

It’s worth noting that violent juvenile crimes on nonschool days don’t follow the same time pattern as on school days -- on nonschool days, juvenile crime peaks between 7 and 9 p.m., according to the federal analysis.

Melissa Sickmund, chief of systems research for the National Center for Juvenile Justice, said the real point is ""that juvenile violence peaks right in the hours after school.""  

And ""that he got right,"" Sickmund said about Lesniak’s statement. ""He just tried to be too precise.""

But there are some other problems with Lesniak’s statement. He was using the statistic to support funding for a New Jersey program that primarily serves elementary and middle school children, but the data doesn’t include figures from New Jersey, and includes all offenders younger than 18.

Two experts told us that children younger than 10-years-old are rarely involved in violent crime.

Back to Lesniak’s statement.

He said juvenile crime rates triple between 3 and 6 p.m.

The state Senator’s statistic was based on a study using FBI data -- that didn’t include New Jersey -- from the 1990s.

Still, Lesniak’s argument that juvenile crime spikes when school lets out is sound -- and supported by more recent data.

We rate his statement Half True.

Wisconsin Family Action says Wisconsin Rep. Fred Clark ran a red light and seriously injured a bicyclist
","
As the Senate recall elections heat up, the personal lives of candidates are dominating the attack ads.  

Their criminal convictions and other transgressions are being highlighted -- along with their voting records and stances on the issues. Many of the ads are being aired by outside groups.

Perhaps no television ad is more startling -- and graphic -- than one being aired in Green Bay and Madison by a group called Wisconsin Family Action. It targets state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo), challenger to state Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon).

The ad, bearing the theme ""Legislators should lead by example,"" runs through Clark’s checkered driving record -- speeding, previous accidents, driving with a suspended license -- and concludes with a disturbing video of an SUV hitting a bicyclist.

In the video, an SUV zips into the frame, slamming into a bicyclist who rode into the intersection. As the crash occurs, the narrator intones: ""Fred Clark ran this red light, seriously injuring this bicyclist."" The audio includes the sound of squealing tires and the shocked voice of a witness on the bus.

(The ad is not available online. A Madison television station did a story about the ad, which includes much of its content that you can see here.)

Did Fred Clark really crash into a bicyclist?

Beyond that, is the video actually from the incident? And who was at fault?

Let’s backpedal.

A Madison police report shows that Clark was involved in car-bike accident on Aug. 18, 2009, near the state Capitol. According to the report:

Clark was driving his 2008 Ford Escape north on Hamilton Street about 4:25 p.m. The bicyclist, a 57-year-old Madison man, was heading north on Webster Street. when he was struck by Clark’s SUV. The report said that Clark ""violated the red traffic signal"" before striking the biker who had a green light.

""I ran a red light,"" Clark told an officer at the scene, the report says. ""I was just not paying attention.""

The cyclist was taken to University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics with back and lung injuries, which the report called ""incapacitating."" An officer attempted to speak with the victim at the hospital but said the man was unable to do so because of his injuries.

Clark received an $88 ticket for running the red light.

After the incident hit the news, his office issued a statement from Clark: ""At this time, my first concern is for the well-being of the cyclist who was injured. What occurred was an accident, and my thoughts are with that person and his family.""

So what of the video in the ad?

The video is real, and it comes from the dashboard camera of a Madison Metro bus that was stopped at the light on Webster Street. The light changes and the bus begins to move into the intersection when Clark’s SUV cuts in front of it and strikes the bike, which approached the intersection alongside the bus.

Julaine Appling, president of Wisconsin Family Actionl, a group that advocates against same sex marriage and ""foundational issues such as marriage, life and liberty"" did not respond to requests for comment about the ad. Likewise, neither Clark nor his campaign was available to discuss the ad.

So where does that leave us?

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Labor', 'Retirement', 'Gina Raimondo']","
R.I. Treasurer Raimondo says 60-year-olds with 401(k)s typically have less than $100,000 in them
","
General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has been leading the drive to overhaul the retirement system for public employees -- with its $7.3-billion unfunded liability -- but has rebuffed calls from some critics to scrap the pension plan altogether.

During an appearance on the July 10 edition of 10 News Conference, when reporter Jim Taricani asked her about the sustainability of the current system, she pointed out that without a pension program, most people are ill-equipped to deal with the financial challenge of retirement.

The state's pension program, she said, ""is clearly crushing the state with a debt we can't afford and that's why we have to fix it. It really is a crisis. Having said that, the average 401(k) in America of a person who's 60 years old is under $100,000, so that isn't retirement security either. I think we can maintain an element of defined benefit, an old-fashioned pension plan, but design it in a way that is sustainable and affordable.""

We wondered whether that's the real average for a typical 60-year-old with a 401(k).

When we asked about the source of her comment, Raimondo's office sent us a lot of material on 401(k)s in general, but none of it was specific to 60-year-olds. As we looked for other data, we realized this would be a complex issue to analyze -- partly because of the difference between average and median. But we’ll get to that.

For starters, some perspective: even having $100,000 in retirement savings isn't a lot.

We did a quick calculation on Fidelity Investment's retirement planning website. Sixty-year-old workers making $50,000 a year who have $100,000 in a 401(k) will only have about half the money they need when they retire, even with Social Security and even if they're aggressively investing in stocks, the market stays strong and they're putting the maximum amount into their retirement savings plan. (For a 60-year-old, the maximum annual contribution limit is $22,000.)

Michael Ryan, a former president of the Rhode Island Society of the Financial Planning Association, said retirees should only tap about 4 to 6 percent of their savings per year if they want their money to last. ""A hundred thousand dollars is going to generate $4,000 to $6,000 a year,"" he said. ""That's not an overwhelming amount of money to have saved for retirement, unfortunately.""

It's also important to talk about how 401(k) savings trends are often characterized.

If you look at some data, it appears that the treasurer is wrong because the average account balance among people in their late 50s and early 60s is well above $100,000.

For example, Fidelity Investments, which handles 401(k) plans for about 11 million people and bills itself as ""the nation's No. 1 provider of workplace retirement savings plans,"" reports that during the first quarter of this year, the average balance for their 401(k) customers age 60 to 64 was $126,200, above the $100,000 cited by Raimondo.

The nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, which has a database of 20.7 million 401(k) participants, reported that in 2009, the average balance for people in their 60s was $162,522.

So, at first, it appears Raimondo is wrong because the correct amount seems to be considerably higher than $100,000.

But Raimondo was talking about a typical individual who has a 401(k) plan, specifically a typical 60-year-old.

For the typical 401(k) saver, the average is the wrong statistic to cite. A small number of people investing aggressively can skew the average upward.

More relevant is the median balance -- how much the individual in the middle of the spectrum has saved.

And that's a very, very different number.

Consider the EBRI data for all age groups. While the average account balance at the end of 2009 was $59,381, the median amount -- representing how much was in the account of a typical 401(k) holder -- was just $17,794.

So what are the numbers for 60-year-olds?

Fidelity said that the median savings accumulated as of March 31 was $45,300 for ages 60 to 64.

(Several people we spoke with emphasized that the median isn't the most accurate number either because it fails to account for people who have changed jobs in recent years and may have, as a result, taken 401(k) savings from past employment and rolled them over into IRAs. As a result, the actual amount saved by a typical worker can be significantly higher than the median numbers would suggest.)

Alicia Munnell, a professor of management sciences at Boston College and coauthor of ""Coming Up Short: The Challenge of 401(k) Plans,"" sent us to the Survey of Consumer Finances, done in 2007 by the Federal Reserve System, which tried to take IRA savings into account. That survey was before the recession but Munnell said the markets have rebounded enough that those numbers probably apply today. (The next SCF isn't due until next year.)

That data, analyzed by Boston College's Center for Retirement Research, also suggests that Raimondo was overly optimistic.

The typical 55- to 65-year-old had $78,000 set aside for retirement, but that included individual retirement accounts created when people leave a job and roll their 401(k) savings into an IRA.

If you only look at the 401(k) savings, the typical 60ish person has about $60,000.

""If someone is saying that people don't have a lot of money in these plans, that's right,"" said Munnell.

Munnell, and others we interviewed, said they knew of no specific data on 60-year-olds.

Raimondo's office cited Munnell's report on the Federal Reserve numbers when we asked for data to support the treasurer's claim.

In summary, Raimondo said that ""the average 401(k) in America of a person who's 60 years old is under $100,000.""

Her spokeswoman, Joy Fox, argued that because the savings rate is under $100,000, Raimondo’s statement would be True, even if the actual number was tens of thousands lower.

Fox also said Raimondo's larger point is that ""given how little the average 401(k) was worth, the defined contribution system did not provide retirement security"" for state workers who, in the treasurer's words, ""at the end of a hardworking career . . . ought to have security in retirement.""

That larger point is well taken. Give Raimondo points for not overstating the problem.

But all the evidence we could find involving that age group suggests that the average account holder has saved about $60,000 or less in their 401(k)s, which is the plan the treasurer cited.

For that reason, we believe her statement is ""accurate but needs clarification or additional information,"" the definition of Mostly True.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Gov. Chris Christie says the New Jersey budget doubled property tax credits and had no new tax increases for the second consecutive year
","
Gov. Chris Christie recently took the budget battle to the airwaves, touting his $29.7 billion spending plan for fiscal year 2012 as a model of fiscal responsibility.

In a radio spot sponsored by the New Jersey Republican State Committee, Christie said the budget ""doubled property tax credits for seniors and middle class New Jerseyans"" and included ""no tax increases for any New Jersey family for the second year in a row.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that the new budget is projected to double the average Homestead property tax credit. The question of tax increases is not as clear-cut, however: the state’s major tax rates have stayed the same, but tax credit programs, including Homestead, were reduced last year.

First, let’s tackle the Homestead credits.

The governor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Republican Party spokesman cited the Homestead program to back up the governor’s claim.

According to a budget analysis by the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, Christie is right that Homestead credits are set to double under the state budget for fiscal 2012.

The fiscal 2012 budget increased funding for the Homestead program from $268.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $458 million.

According to OLS, the ""$189.8 million funding increase is slated to pay for a doubling in (fiscal) 2012 of homestead credits beneficiaries received in (fiscal) 2011.""

The analysis, citing estimates from the governor’s office, said the average credit for 938,500 homeowners would increase to $476 in fiscal 2012 from $238 in fiscal 2011, when credits were cut significantly.

So, Christie technically doubled credits in fiscal 2012. However, the average Homestead benefit would still be less than half of the $1,035 average in fiscal 2010, according to OLS estimates.

Also, in fiscal 2012, Christie is maintaining the eligibility requirements for homeowners set by his predecessor -- up to $150,000 in income for senior and disabled homeowners and up to $75,000 in income for all other homeowners.

But the fiscal 2011 reduction in the Homestead credits work against the governor’s argument that there have been no tax increases for two consecutive years.

It is true that the rates for the state’s three major taxes -- gross income, sales and corporation business -- have not increased under Christie.

But it’s also true that the state has reduced funding for some tax credits, which could leave people with less money to offset their tax bills.

Between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, the state reduced funding for the Homestead and senior freeze programs as well as the State Earned Income Tax Credit. Individuals can receive the earned income tax credits even if they don’t owe taxes. Senior freeze provides additional property tax relief for senior citizens and the disabled.

Four experts with different political persuasions and a Rutgers University professor told us that cutting one or all of those payments could be considered tax increases.

Josh Barro, a fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, said a reduction in the earned income tax credit was not a tax hike, because it’s a welfare payment through the tax code. But reducing the property tax credits could be considered tax increases, since they’re meant to offset property tax burdens, Barro said.

Curtis Dubay, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said a reduction in the earned income tax credit could force a recipient to pay more taxes if his credit still falls short. For example, an individual may owe $1,000 in income taxes and then receive a credit for $800, but still owe $200 in taxes, Dubay said.

But Alan Berube of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program said in an email that a reduction would affect earned income tax credit recipients with no remaining income tax liability. ""For all, it will increase their total tax bill when you consider all state and local taxes together (i.e, not just income taxes),"" he wrote.

Andrew Pratt, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, argued in a series of emails that the earned income tax credit is just a payment to low-income individuals, not a tax break. Pratt pointed out that nearly 75 percent of recipients in 2010 did not owe income taxes.

Individuals don’t have to file income tax returns if they earn less than $10,000 annually for single filers or less than $20,000 for married couples filing jointly.

Pratt added, ""The Senior Freeze and Homestead credits are payments from the Treasury. You cannot classify a reduction or a freeze in the payment or eligibility as a tax increase, unless you are doing so to score political points.""
 
Let’s recap:

Christie said in a radio ad that the fiscal 2012 budget doubles property tax credits and includes no tax increases for the second consecutive year.

The governor’s right about the property tax credits being doubled, even though they’ll remain below the fiscal 2010 average. It’s true that the rates for the state’s three major taxes have remained the same.

But three tax credit programs were reduced in fiscal 2011, and several experts said at least one of those reductions could represent a tax hike.

We rate the statement Half True.

Ron Paul says members of military have given him far more money than other GOP candidates and Barack Obama
","
If he were president, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul says, the United States would remove its forces from Afghanistan as ""quickly as the ships could get there.""

In a July 20 interview with PBS’s ""NewsHour,"" the Lake Jackson Republican continued: ""It's insane on what we're doing. And I'll tell you one thing about this business about the military: We just had a quarterly (campaign finance) report, and they listed all the money that all the candidates got from the military. I got twice as much as all the other candidates put together on the Republican side, and even more than Obama got, which tells me that these troops want to come home as well because they know exactly what I'm talking about.""

There’s no clear-cut way to gauge why members of the military gave to Paul’s campaign or to others. But we wondered if Paul was squared away on how much more money his presidential campaign reaped from members of the military.

A posting on his campaign website the same day he appeared on ""NewsHour"" sheds a little light. Headlined ""Ron Paul Campaign Raises Most Donations From Military,"" it says that Paul has ""raised more than any other current presidential candidate in donations from members of the military. Of those donors who indicated their occupation and employer, Paul topped the other contenders.""

Next, we turned to the presidential candidates’ latest campaign finance filings compiled by the Federal Election Commission, which breaks out donations by donors’ employers. In an interview, commission spokeswoman Mary Brandenberger told us the agency makes sure that each report complies with a federal law requiring candidates to list the occupation of each donor of $200 or more.

A caveat: We did not achieve accounting-quality math in this look; there’s no quick way to do so. It’s also possible we missed a donation or two. Consider the numbers that follow in the ballpark.

That said, from April through June, Paul fielded more than $25,000 from individuals who listed their employer as a branch of the military.

Combined, six other Republican presidential candidates listed donations from members of the military totaling about $9,000. Our most-to-least breakdown: Herman Cain, $2,850; Mitt Romney, $2,750; Michele Bachmann, $2,250; Newt Gingrich, $500; and Tim Pawlenty and Rick Santorum, $250 each.

On the Democratic side, Obama’s campaign received more than $16,000 in donations from members of the military.

After we conducted this rough check, Paul’s campaign spokesman, Gary Howard, said by email that their numbers showed that Paul garnered $34,480 from members of the military; other GOP candidates fielded $13,848 and Obama took in $19,849.

Summing up, Paul’s military-connected contributions for the three months more than double such contributions to all the other Republican presidential candidates—and they also exceed Obama’s.

Ronald Reagan talks about the debt ceiling
","
With much glee, Democrats have seized on old audio recordings of President Ronald Reagan talking about the debt limit. House Democrats have even posted a snippet on YouTube.

Here's what the Gipper had to say on the matter back in 1986:

""Unfortunately, Congress consistently brings the government to the edge of default before facing its responsibility. This brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds and those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits. Interest rates would skyrocket, instability would occur in financial markets, and the federal deficit would soar. The United States has a special responsibility to itself and the world to meet its obligations. It means we have a well-earned reputation for reliability and credibility -- two things that set us apart from much of the world.""

President Barack Obama, meanwhile, invoked Reagan when he answered a question from NPR on why negotiations to increase the debt ceiling have taken so long. 

Obama said it was more than just one thing. 

""You've got some members of the Republican Party who've been downplaying the consequences of default. The irony is, you know, Ronald Reagan, I think, when he was president, repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the United States to be impaired in any kind of way. I think that there is some politics. And compromising with me, among some Republican leaders, is bad politics for them,"" he said on July 21, 2011.

Intrigued by the audio files going around the Internet, we decided to fact-check Obama's statement that Reagan repeatedly talked about avoiding debt limit showdowns.

Reagan made the comments quoted above in a radio address to the nation on Sept. 26, 1987. But Reagan also laid out other principles for Congress in that address: cut spending, leave the defense budget alone, don't raise taxes. (Read the entire address via the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.)

""For those who say further responsible spending reductions are not possible, they are wrong. For those who say the only choice is undermining our national security at a time when the United States is close to an agreement with the Soviet Union on reducing nuclear weapons, they are wrong. For those who say more taxes will solve our deficit problem, they are wrong. Every time Congress increases taxes, the deficit does not decrease, spending increases. It's time for a clear and consistent policy to reduce the federal budget deficit,"" he said.

Looking for more examples of Reagan ""repeatedly"" warning about the debt ceiling,we also ran across a letter Reagan wrote in 1983 to then-Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, R-Tenn., asking for help. (The Washington Post posted the letter to its website.)

""This country now possesses the strongest credit in the world,"" Reagan wrote. ""The full consequences of a default – or even the serious prospect of default – by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United States would have substantial effects on the domestic financial markets and the value of the dollar in exchange markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such a result. The risks, the costs, the disruptions, and the incalculable damage lead me to but one conclusion: the Senate must pass this legislation before the Congress adjourns.""

Interestingly, we also found statements from Reagan supporting changes to the tax code that increased revenues. That's a major sticking point in today's negotiations between Obama and Republicans. In a lengthy 1982 speech, he noted that some people called the bill he favored ""the largest tax increase in history."" But Reagan said it was tax reform, not a tax increase.

""Of the entire $99 billion (in new tax revenue), $32 billion is collection of tax presently owed under the present laws and which is not being paid,"" Reagan said. ""Now, to all of you who are paying your tax, simple fairness says we should collect from those who are freeloading. Roughly $48 billion of the $99 billion represents closing off special-interest loopholes which have resulted in unintended tax advantages for some -- not all -- taxpayers, some who are financially well able to pay their share. Now, this is also a matter of simple fairness. So, more than 80 percent of the tax bill is not new tax at all, but is better collecting and correcting of flaws in the system.""

We reached Reagan biographer Lou Cannon and asked him about Reagan's comments on raising the debt ceiling and avoiding default. He noted the historical trend that, regardless of party, presidents have traditionally raised the debt ceiling, while members of Congress -- like Sen. Barack Obama back in 2006 -- balked at raising it.

But Reagan also had a strong sense that the country's creditworthiness was important, Cannon said. 

""On matters like extending the full faith and credit of the government, on paying its bills, Reagan was a real conservative, in the old sense. Most of the true conservatives in those days wouldn't have considered defaulting on their debts.""

He also noted that Reagan wasn't opposed to legislative compromises, getting spending cuts when he could. ""He was a practical person,"" Cannon said. ""He would say, let's take some this year and come back next year and take some more.""

Obama said that Reagan ""repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the United States to be impaired in any kind of way."" We found two examples and a Reagan expert said they typified his approach to the federal debt. Reagan talked about other things more, like keeping taxes low and funding defense. But his remarks on the debt ceiling are real and apparently heartfelt. We rate Obama's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/22/barack-obama/ronald-reagan-talks-about-debt-ceiling/

Victoria Jackson column claims health care law gives Obama power to raise a private army
","
If you thought that comparing President Barack Obama to Adolph Hitler was just a passing fad, you should know the trend lives on at the website WorldNetDaily.

Comedian Victoria Jackson, a Saturday Night Live alum and tea party supporter, recently penned a column titled, ""The 3 scariest things about Obama."" Jackson is a regular WorldNetDaily columnist and is slated to attend the WND Tea Party at Sea cruise of Alaska later this summer.

To quote the piece, the three scary things are ""private army (like Hitler), socialist (like Hitler), media control (like Hitler).""

She continues: ""A clause hidden in the Obamacare bill, which is now law, gives Obama the right to form a private army. Why isn't anyone freaking out?""

A reader sent us the column, published July 15, 2011, and asked us to fact-check it. Given Jackson's background as a comedian, we wondered if it was a joke. We concluded that it wasn't, and we're treating it here as a serious claim. 

Jackson backs up her points with YouTube videos of segments from Fox News. Her claim that Obama has the right to form a private army is based on a 2010 appearance of Fox analyst Andrew Napolitano, who discussed the health care law with Fox News anchor Shepard Smith. We're not sure of the exact date of the interview, but it was posted to YouTube on May 3, 2010, just months after final passage of the health care law.

""By referring to it as a reserve corps, and the training is the same as the regular corps, it gives you the impression that the president has the power to take over the National Guard from state governors in peace time. Now under the Constitution, he can't do that. But a fair reading of this legislation would let him do it,"" Napolitano said.

""Another way to read this legislation is that these are health care professionals, but they're going to train with the military, meaning they would carry sidearms,"" Napolitano said. 

Napolitano hedges his provocative claims by saying that the legislation raises many questions. ""We don't know how this is going to be implemented; the language is intentionally vague."" But he called the use of the military language ""scary."" 

We turned to the text of the bill to see if it said anything about the National Guard or about health care professionals training with the military. It didn't. 

Instead, the sliver of evidence for the claim is that the U.S. Public Health Service uses military terms to organize its Commissioned Corps, a uniformed group of 6,500 health professionals. The military-like organization dates back to 1871 and comes from the Commissioned Corps' work with Marine hospitals stationed along coastal and inland waterways. (It's also why the Surgeon General is called the Surgeon General.) Today, teams of Commissioned Corps officers often work with the military on humanitarian missions, and some serve on U.S. Navy hospital ships. In recent years, the Commisioned Corps' emergency response teams have responded to hurricanes hitting the Gulf Coast and international incidents like the earthquake in Haiti. 

But the Commissioned Corps is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, not the U.S. military. Likewise, the new ""Ready Reserve Corps"" will be part of HHS, and not part of the military. 

The text of the health care law says plainly, ""The purpose of the Ready Reserve Corps is to fulfill the need to have additional Commissioned Corps personnel available on short notice (similar to the uniformed service's reserve program) to assist regular Commissioned Corps personnel to meet both routine public health and emergency response missions.""

The Public Health Service explains the new initiative similarly:  
""The purpose of the Ready Reserve Corps is to have additional Commissioned Corps personnel available on short notice (similar to the other uniformed services' reserve programs) to assist full time Commissioned Corps personnel to meet both routine public health and emergency response missions. Prior to the passage of the new law, the USPHS Commissioned Corps did not have a reserve component to call upon in this fashion. The Ready Reserve Corps members perform duties for assigned periods of time as opposed to full time Corps members who are on extended active duty. Joining the Ready Reserve Corps is voluntary; however, members of the Ready Reserve Corps join knowing that they can be called at anytime to serve in times of national need.""

Out of an abundance of caution, we contacted James Parascandola, who served as the Public Health Service historian from 1992 to 2004. He confirmed that the Commissioned Corps and the Ready Reserve Corps are uniformed health officials. ""They don't train with the military, and they don't carry weapons,"" he said. They sometimes work with the military, but they do so as medical personnel, not as a private army. 

Jackson said that the health care law gives Obama ""the right to form a private army."" We don't find that to be the case, and her source, Andrew Napolitano, seems to be making up interpretations of the health care law that have no basis in reality. The Ready Reserve Corps created by the law would be part of a long-established uniformed team of health care professionals that are part of the Department of Health and Human Services, not the military. They don't carry sidearms, and they don't have military training. If this is Obama's army, it's an army armed with tongue depressors and stethoscopes. For perpetuating nonsense, we rate Jackson's statement Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2011/jul/22/victoria-jackson/victoria-jackson-column-claims-health-care-law-giv/

Blogger says Mary Nolan is a party-line Democrat who voted with the ACLU 100 percent of the time
","
In early July 2011, Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland, announced she’d run for a spot on the Portland City Council. Not long after that, critics started taking aim. Jack Bogdanski, a local blogger, waited just one day, in fact, before he let loose in a blog that questioned Nolan’s (and her husband’s) connections to the council.

He also threw in this little bit as an aside: ""In the Legislature, she has been a party-line Democrat, showing a 100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union.""

These sorts of attacks are pretty common when it comes to campaigns -- look at how much of a partisan so-and-so is, look how often the candidate votes with a specific organization. Still, they’re worth checking out, not just because it’s important to know whether they’re accurate, but also because it’s important to know what exactly, a ""100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union"" -- for instance -- might look like.

In the statement itself, there are actually two assertions. The first is that Nolan is a party-line Democrat. The second is that she has voted 100 percent in line with the ACLU.

Let’s start with the ACLU.

This is a pretty easy fact to check. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon creates a Legislative Scorecard for each session dating back to 1997. They don’t have the most recent 2011 session tabulated just yet, so we started with the scorecard that combined the voting positions from the 2009 session and the 2010 special session.

On that scorecard, Nolan did get a 100 percent. In fact, Nolan got the highest score of any lawmaker in both the House and Senate.

What exactly does that mean? Well, here are some of the votes that earned her that 100:

-She opposed a bill that overturned a law prohibiting public school teachers from wearing religious dress. (This passed.)*
-She opposed a law that created a government-operated pharmacy database of prescriptions. (This passed.)
-She supported a bill that prohibited the state from taking further steps to implement the federal Real ID Act. (This passed.)
-She opposed a bill that expanded the death penalty and gave fetuses equal status as a ""human being"" under state law. (This failed.)
-She opposed a bill that would have allowed employers to terminate employees who hold medical marijuana cards, without evidence of impairment on the job. (This failed.)
-She opposed an amendment to the Oregon Constitution’s free expression clause to allow local governments to regulate nude dancing. (This failed.)

Now, that’s just two sessions worth of voting. We figured we should do our due diligence and check back as far as 2001 -- Nolan’s first term in the Oregon House. As it happens, Nolan has earned a 100 percent each year the scorecard has been done, save for 2003, when she earned an 80 percent. That year she went against the ACLU and voted in favor of legislation that limited access to public records about Oregon Health & Science University animal researchers.

Besides that hiccup, though, it does seem that Nolan votes in harmony with the ACLU nearly 100 percent of the time.

We asked Nolan whether this sounded right to her and, after taking a look at past scorecards, she said it did.

""I don't keep track of scorecards,"" she said. ""But i do very consistently vote to protect the rights of people of color, of women, of kids, of gays and lesbians, of whistle blowers …

""It happens that that's what the ACLU cares about. But i care about it because government ought to protect the rights of the people who don't have power of their own.""

Now, let’s get to that other bit of the statement, the one that calls Nolan a party-line Democrat.

To check this bit, we turned to The Oregonian’s Your Government website. People smarter than we are have created a vote recorder that keeps tabs on every floor vote made in the Oregon Capitol and then does some mathematics to figure out just how often a given representative or senator votes with her or his own party.

If you look at the numbers for the 2011 session, Nolan voted along party lines just over 92 percent of the time. Your average Democrat last session voted with the party about 94 percent of the time.

This database doesn’t got as far back as 2001, but we checked the figures for the 2010 special session and the 2009 regular session. In 2010, she voted with her party 98 percent of the time (same as your average Democrat), and in 2009, she voted with her party 97.5 percent of the time (also the average).

Now, these scores don’t offer a whole lot of nuance in terms of what she broke with her party on, but the general idea that she votes in harmony with her party seems pretty well supported by these figures.

We’ll give the statement that Nolan is ""a party-line Democrat, showing a 100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union"" a True. 
*CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the effect of this bill. The sentence has been updated. The ruling was not affected. ",/factchecks/2011/jul/22/jack-bogdanski/blogger-says-mary-nolan-party-line-democrat-who-vo/

Wisconsin GOP state Sen. Randy Hopper says Democrat challenger Jessica King voted to increase her pay 63 percent
","
Jessica King was a part of the first graduating class of Emerge Wisconsin, which touts itself as the premier program for training Democratic women to run for office. She was elected to the Oshkosh Common Council in 2007, even before completing the training.

In 2008, King ran for an open seat in the state Senate, but lost to Republican Randy Hopper of Fond du Lac. After a recount, the margin was 163 votes out of more than 83,000 cast.

When Hopper became one of the Republican senators targeted for recall for his support of GOP Gov. Scott Walker, King entered the race, creating a rematch. 
Hopper dismissed King as having a ""liberal tax-and-spend agenda"" and has since sharpened his attack ahead of the Aug. 9, 2011 election.

A Hopper TV ad released July 15, 2011 begins by praising his own work as a lawmaker. Then, as background music turns ominous, the narrator says:

""When you see Jessica King’s negative attacks, remember 63. King opposed balancing the state budget and voted to increase her pay with taxpayer dollars by 63 percent. Raising your pay by 63? Does Jessica King really care about you and me?""

A politician voting herself a 63 percent pay raise during tough economic times?

That’s worth a look.

Asked for evidence to back the attack, Hopper campaign spokesman Sean Stephenson cited the 2009 and 2010 and Oshkosh city budgets.

They show the pay appropriated for the seven council members -- the mayor and six aldermen -- totaled $17,400 in 2008 and had risen to $28,500 in 2010. That’s an increase of 63.8 percent.

But that doesn’t break down how much of a raise King might have received, nor whether she voted for it. So we went back to Stephenson, who stood by the 63 percent claim. He said the proof King voted for the raise was that she voted for the 2009 and 2010 city budgets.

King campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris pointed instead to a vote on a pay raise ordinance the Oshkosh council took April 8, 2008.

The ordinance and official minutes from that meeting show the council voted, 4-3, to double the mayor’s salary to $6,000 and boost the salary of each of the six council members from $2,400 to $3,750, or 56 percent.

King voted no on the raises, saying salaries should be reviewed by a citizen committee.

Oshkosh City Manager Mark Rohloff said the council members’ pay can be raised only through an ordinance such as the pay ordinance King voted against. City budgets cannot authorize pay raises for elected officials; they only carry out what has been legally authorized by an earlier pay ordinance, he said.

One more point before we close: By law, elected officials cannot directly vote themselves pay raises. Any raises that they adopt can’t take effect for a particular office until after that office comes up for election again.

The Oshkosh raises took effect in April 2009, a year after the council adopted the pay ordinance. So, although King voted against the raises, she did receive the 56 percent raise herself after being re-elected in 2009.

Let’s get back to the claim.

In a TV ad, Hopper said King voted to increase her pay on the Oshkosh Common Council by 63 percent. It’s ridiculous to claim King voted for the raise, given that she voted against the ordinance that raised the pay -- which is the only legal way council pay can be raised. And Hopper’s claim of 63 percent itself is false, given that the correct raise figure is a somewhat lower 56 percent.

Ridiculous and false. Around here, that’s a combustible mixture. We give Hopper’s claim a Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/jul/22/randy-hopper/wisconsin-gop-state-sen-randy-hopper-says-democrat/

Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison says government is the only growth sector the nation has had in last two years
","
Questioned about how the United States should bring down its national debt, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said government spending cuts, not tax increases, are the best tool. 
""We think the government is spending too much,"" the Republican said during a June 29 interview on CNBC. ""The only growth sector that we've had in the last two years in America is government growth. That's not the way to come out of this massive $14 trillion debt burden that most surely is going to affect the middle class, and so I think the answer is not to tax anyone further, but to cut government spending."" 
We wondered if Hutchison's government growth statement was on the money. 
During the interview, Hutchison didn't specify what kind of growth she was talking about. Her office told us later that she was referring to employment. 
To support Hutchison’s statement, her office sent us a graph originally posted in February in a blog on the website of the conservative Heritage Foundation, which attributed the figures to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau, which is the government’s official source for job numbers, breaks down data on total (nonfarm) employment in several ways, including into the broad categories of ""private"" and ""government"" jobs but also into more detailed private industry sectors such as manufacturing and health care. 
The graph compares employment trends in two categories — the hefty private sector and the much smaller federal government — over a three-year period, from January 2008 (the month after the latest recession began) to January 2011. 
According to the graph, the federal workforce, excluding postal and temporary census workers, grew 11.7 percent in those years while private-sector employment fell 6.6 percent. 
That seems to support Hutchison's statement. However, the graph's time period doesn't align perfectly with the two-year period mentioned by Hutchison. Also, it solely tracks a subset of federal government workers, a qualification Hutchison did not make in her statement. 
In the CNBC interview, Hutchison specified a time period of ""the last two years."" Yet the graph covers a three-year span that ended five months before the interview. 
Significantly, when assessing employment trends, altering a time frame — even slightly — can change the picture. That's so in this case with private-sector employment. 
Hutchison’s office correctly pointed out that the number of private-sector jobs is far lower (about 6 percent) than it was before the start of the recession in December 2007. Yet, figures show, there has been private-sector growth more recently. 
At the time of the senator's interview, the most recent monthly employment data available from BLS was for May 2011. We found that between May 2009 and May 2011, private-sector jobs increased by about half a million (from 108.4 million to 108.9 million). There also was growth over the two-year period from April 2009 (108.7 million) to April 2011 (108.8 million). 
Then again, the result flip-flops — showing private-sector job losses — if you start the two-year comparison with March, February or January of this year. 
What gives? The answer has to do with the long-term trend. Starting in February 2008, the number of private-sector jobs in the United States fell for 25 months. In March 2010, that figure began to inch up again. It wasn't until April 2011 that the figure surpassed its two-year-previous level. 
Looking at the last two years of data on the number of federal employees who do not work for the Census Bureau or the post office, as the graph specifies, supports Hutchison's claim that there was growth. According to BLS information, that category of workers increased between May 2009 (2.1 million) and May 2011 (2.2 million). 
James Sherk, a Heritage Foundation policy analyst, explained that it made sense to use federal employment data that excluded postal and temporary census workers in the graph because it was created to highlight the part of the federal work force that is under President Barack Obama's control. The census workers were short-term employees whose hiring did not represent a long-term trend, Sherk said. And changes in the level of postal employees are determined by the demand for the agency's services, he said. 
But in her CNBC statement, Hutchison didn't say non-postal, non-census federal workers, or even simply federal workers. She said government. 
BLS reports information on overall government employment as a combination of federal, state and local workers. (The latter two categories make up the vast majority of the total.) From May 2009 to May 2011, total government employment dropped from 22.6 million to 22.1 million. 
In a July 12 item, PolitiFact National found that declines in state and local workforces have driven the overall drop in government workers. Among factors noted: the end of federal stimulus aid to states, continuing weakness in the economy and shrinking state and local revenue. 
Another recent PolitiFact National item noted that between the official end of the recession in June 2009 and June 2011, private payrolls have increased by about 1 million workers while government payrolls have declined by about 490,000. That’s the opposite of Hutchison's claim. 
Hutchison spokeswoman Lisette Mondello told us that even though the senator did not specify ""federal"" in her CNBC statement about government growth, the senator was obviously referring to federal government job growth since at the time she was discussing federal spending. 
Final thoughts: We ran Hutchison’s statement by a couple of experts before we received backup information from the senator. 
Noting Hutchison’s use of the word ""sector"" in her CNBC statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, suggested we compare the data on overall government employment with how other industry groups performed, rather than simply looking at the private sector as a whole. Of eight BLS sector categories, we found five whose payrolls grew over the last two years: mining and logging, professional and business services, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and ""other,"" which includes laundry services and membership associations, among others. 
Abbot and economist Lisa Mataloni of the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, each noted that Hutchison didn’t use the word ""jobs"" in her remarks on CNBC and suggested that the senator's statement could be interpreted as about something else altogether. 
Mataloni pointed us to a data source — ""real gross value added by sector"" — that essentially measures, in dollars, how much an industry or a sector contributes to gross domestic product, itself a measure of the country's output of goods and services. The change in GDP from quarter to quarter is how the government quantifies the growth of the economy. 
The most recent two years' worth of data, from the last quarter of 2008 to the last quarter of 2010, show the contributions of both the business and government sectors as increasing between those quarters. 
All told, we see no reason to penalize Hutchison for failing to say that job gains (and losses) were the basis of her growth claim or failing to specify that by ""government,"" she meant ""federal."" But she relied on an outdated report speaking to a three-year, not two-year, period. Over the two-year period that she noted, the federal government was not the only growth sector. Private-sector employment also increased. 
We rate her statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/22/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-hutchison-says-government-only-growth-sector-n/
