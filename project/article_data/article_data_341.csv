Federal judge called Obama immigration action 'unconstitutional,' David Jolly says
","A recent Texas federal court decision has given congressional Republicans new hope that they can stop President Barack Obama’s executive action to delay the deportation of some illegal immigrants. Here’s how U.S. Rep. David Jolly, a Florida Republican, put it Feb. 26, 2015, during House floor debate: ""I understand there's disagreement over the president's executive order last September. I think it was wrong. Members on the other side don't,"" Jolly said. ""A federal judge has said it's unconstitutional. The president of the United States said over 20 times he didn't have the authority to do it, and yet he did it."" Jolly was talking as Congress was wrestling with a proposal to defund Obama’s execution action as part of a larger proposal to fund the Department of Homeland Security. House Republicans eventually passed a bill funding the homeland security agency without the immigration rider. What caught our attention was the claim that a federal judge labeled Obama’s action ""unconstitutional."" Turns out, it is not as simple as that. The executive action Obama announced Nov. 20, 2014, that immigration officials would delay deportation of unauthorized immigrants for the parents of children who are citizens or have green cards, as long as the parents have been in the country for more than five years and met other criteria. (Jolly said September, but his spokesman said he had simply mixed up the dates with a press conference about Syria.) The 2014 action, referred to as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (sometimes called Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, or DAPA for short), let qualified immigrants apply for work permits and to avoid deportation for three years at a time. The applicants had to pass background checks and pay a fee. More than 4 million people were estimated to qualify under the DAPA executive action, which built upon Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. That initiative protected ""dreamers,"" people who had been brought to the United States illegally as children and had no criminal record. DAPA in the courts As of this writing, the November executive action is on hold indefinitely. On Feb. 16, a day before the action was to take effect, Texas U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen issued an injunction stopping the action from being carried out. He was hearing a Texas case that included 26 states (including Florida) challenging Obama’s announcement. Hanen said the change would be a burden on states, writing ""no statute gives the DHS the discretion it is trying to exercise here."" This is the portion of the ruling Jolly first cited when we asked him what he meant. Hanen had ruled ""that the president and his secretary acted legislatively by creating new law regarding immigration enforcement,"" and thereby violated the constitutional separation of powers, Jolly told PolitiFact Florida in a statement. But several experts in immigration policy and constitutional law disagreed with Jolly’s assessment. The impression a reasonable person could make from Jolly’s statement is that a federal judge ruled the action unconstitutional, which is not the case. The states bringing the case did argue the action was unconstitutional -- a point Hanen discussed at length in his opinion, but explicitly said he would not rule on. Hanen said Texas had proven its grievance enough for the case to proceed, but not because the action was unconstitutional. Instead, the judge said the action violated something called the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, which Hanen interpreted as specifying the president should have formally posted a public notice in the Federal Register about the action and held a public comment period before enacting it. The Justice Department will take the case to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. ""The more correct formulation would be that ‘A federal judge has said it’s illegal,’ "" Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian said. We did find a separate instance in which a federal judge said Obama’s executive action was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab in Pennsylvania said in a Dec. 16, 2014, ruling that ""President Obama’s unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause, and, therefore, is unconstitutional."" That case, though, was about whether Obama’s executive action applied to the defendant, a Honduran immigrant who was in the process of being deported for being in the country illegally. Schwab said the defendant could change his plea and face trial under the executive action, but the immigrant declined and was deported because the action doesn’t apply in criminal cases. Schwab’s position doesn’t set precedent, Washington University law professor Stephen Legomsky said, because it’s just the judge’s opinion and not a ruling. (Jolly said he agreed with Schwab’s characterization after we asked about it.) Lastly, Washington D.C. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell rejected the argument of Schwab and others in December when she threw out a lawsuit from Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio, in which the sheriff called Obama’s executive action unconstitutional. Howell ruled Arpaio couldn’t prove the action harmed the sheriff’s department and that deferred action was a congressionally approved method of enforcing policy, and therefore constitutional. ""Any party can raise an alleged constitutional violation,"" Cornell law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said. ""Only when the Supreme Court rules on the executive action’s constitutionality will that issue be resolved once and for all."" Our ruling Jolly said a federal judge called Obama’s executive action on immigration ""unconstitutional."" A reasonable person may think Jolly meant a judge ruled the action violated the Constitution, but that isn’t accurate. A federal judge in Texas said the government was acting outside its authority by issuing the order. But the actual ruling said the state of Texas had a chance to win a case based on a procedural misstep, not the action’s constitutionality. Another federal judge in Pennsylvania really did call the action unconstitutional, but that was an opinion in a ruling on a deportation case in which the action didn’t apply. Jolly's statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/05/david-jolly/federal-judge-called-obama-immigration-action-unco/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Homeland Security', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio: At least three sectors of the border are 'completely insecure'
","Sen. Marco Rubio said he’s learned some lessons from his first failed foray into the immigration policy game. ""What I’ve learned, is you can’t even have a conversation about that until people believe and know — not just believe, but it’s proven to them — that future illegal immigration will controlled,"" Rubio said. ""That is the single biggest lesson of the last two years."" A big piece of that, Rubio said, is border security, and he gave this stat: ""There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure."" The southwest border spans from San Diego to the southern tip of Texas, and it is broken into nine sectors. Are at least three of those sectors ""completely insecure""? We decided to check. What is ‘secure’? Border patrol agents have many duties, of which stopping illegal migration is one. They also have to prevent drugs and weapons trafficking across the border, thwart potential terrorist plots, stop money laundering, among other tasks. As it is, there’s no set definition for what constitutes a ""secure"" border, experts told us. If you think one failure to apprehend a border crosser means a sector is insecure, then the whole border lacks security. That’s unreasonable. But where do you draw the line for what constitutes ""secure."" Additionally, we don’t know exactly what percentage of people successfully cross the border, nor how many successful drug running missions there are each year, etc. We can measure how many are caught in the act, but that’s only one part of the equation. So when Rubio says the border is ""completely insecure,"" that’s not really grounded in any set metric. We asked Rubio’s office to explain what he meant by ""completely insecure"" and which three border sectors he was referring to. Spokeswoman Brooke Sammon did not respond to our multiple emails and calls. Measuring sector security A Government Accountability Office report from 2011 on border control measures broke down how much of each sector in 2010 was under ""operational control."" That means agents had the ability to apprehend violators upon or immediately after entry. Here’s what they found.  Four sectors obviously stick out for their lack of operational control: Marfa (now called Big Bend), Del Rio, Laredo and Rio Grande Valley. All four achieved operational control for less than 40 percent of their respective sector. Again, this data is from 2010, so it’s unclear how those sectors of the border have fared since. At the time, operational control of the border had been increasing by 126 miles annually dating back to 2005 and more resources have been put toward the border since. Additionally, these are based on qualitative assessments. Also, the Department of Homeland Security scrapped them because they don’t provide much useful information for determining the effectiveness of border security in a particular sector. It hasn’t replaced it with anything more useful yet, said Theresa Brown, director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The Bipartisan Policy Center tracks an effectiveness rate for each sector based on the number of apprehensions and turnbacks versus ""got aways,"" meaning border patrol agents found evidence (security footage, tracks, etc.) that someone made it through. Here are the center’s most recent calculations for Fiscal Year 2013. Sector Apprehensions Turnbacks Got aways Effectiveness Big Bend 3,493 160 1,757 67.52 percent Del Rio 20,904 4,287 5,157 83.01 percent El Centro 15,725 3,688 2,779 87.48 percent El Paso 10,214 12,054 1,599 93.30 percent Laredo 45,971 16,032 15,603 79.89 percent Rio Grande 128,426 69,815 102,763 65.88 percent San Diego 26,428 7,518 3,861 89.79 percent Tucson 110,264 40,946 37,098 80.30 percent Yuma 5,734 1,993 434 94.64 percent By this rating, there are two sectors that are well below the rest in effectiveness rating: Big Bend and Rio Grande. It’s worth pointing out that Big Bend, in west Texas, sees a smaller level of activity than most other sectors and experts generally don’t consider it a problem zone. ""You wouldn’t invest a lot of resources into a sector like Big Bend with very little traffic,"" said Christopher Wilson, a senior associate at the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute. The Rio Grande Experts we spoke with easily identified the one border sector Rubio singled out when he said ""one in particular"" faced security issues: the Rio Grande sector. The number of apprehensions at the Rio Grande sector doubled to 256,000 in 2014 as a wave of unaccompanied minors and migrants from Central America attempted to enter the United States through the southernmost part of Texas. This has posed new challenges for the sector, which also saw a 7 percentage point drop in its effectiveness rate from 2012 to 2013. ""I’m not sure what the senator means when he says ‘completely insecure,’ but it is true that there has been a big surge in border crossers at that point over the last few years,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. As for the other two sectors that are ""completely insecure,"" experts studying immigration at four different think tanks of varying political stripe couldn’t guess which two Rubio was referring to. The border sector with the most activity other than the Rio Grande is Tucson, which for a long time was the preferred route for Mexican immigration. However, apprehensions are down there from over 600,000 in 2000 to less than 90,000 in 2014. Rubio’s statement in general misses the broader trends across most of the border: Illegal migration through the border is down considerably from the record highs of the previous decade. In 2007, there were 1.6 million apprehensions, turn backs or gotaways at the border, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That dropped to 741,881 in 2013. That gels with other data that shows the overall population of native Mexicans living in the United States is leveling, Wilson said. Additionally, eight sectors, including the troubled Rio Grande, had higher effectiveness ratings in 2013 than they did in 2006. ""The number of people trying to come across the southwest border is substantially lower than it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s,"" Brown said. ""It's starting to increase again, but the absolute levels are way, way down, the lowest since the 1970s."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure."" We don’t know how Rubio came up with three sectors, and neither did experts we spoke with. There certainly is one sector of late with a troubling amount of activity, the Rio Grande in south Texas, that also is less effective at apprehending border crossers than other sectors. However, the number of people attempting to cross the border is down considerably everywhere else, and the effectiveness rating is up in eight of nine sectors since 2006, including the areas with the most significant activity. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/05/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-least-three-sectors-border-are-complet/

Dan Patrick errs, saying Texas will end fiscal year with more reserves than other states combined
","Texas state government can afford tax cuts and targeted investments and will still have billions of dollars left over, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Austin radio station KLBJ AM. In the Feb. 25, 2015 interview, which we caught online, Patrick said: ""We are in the best financial shape of any state in the country. We’ll have about $11 billion or so in our rainy day fund by the end of our fiscal year. That’s more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined."" This fiscal year runs through August 2015. Could it be that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than all other states combined? We emailed Patrick’s office to seek the basis of his statement and to gauge if he was trying to make an uncheckable prediction—rather than a flat factual statement. We also looked for the latest information on each state’s expected fiscal-year-end reserves. The Texas state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, issued his two-year state revenue forecast in January 2015. Hegar said the state’s rainy day fund will have a balance of nearly $8.5 billion when fiscal 2015 ends Aug. 31, 2015. Hegar projected the fund to grow to $9.8 billion a year later and to $11 billion through August 2017. Per Patrick’s statement, then, all the other states together should be expecting to end their 2015 fiscal years with less than $8.5 billion, combined. Texas, Alaska outpace other states An online search led us to a fall 2014 report by the National Association of State Budget Officers initially making us think Patrick was onto something. In the report, The Fiscal Survey of States, a section headlined ""Year-End Balances"" said that generally, states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since revenues plummeted during the Great Recession of 2009-10. State budgets passed into law for the 2015 fiscal year show reserve balances nationally totaling $53.1 billion, the report said. And, the report said, ""a disproportionate share of state budget reserves are concentrated in Alaska and Texas, which account for $20.6 billion or 38.8 percent of states reported total balances in fiscal 2015."" Pew official For more perspective, we sought guidance from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which in July 2014 issued a report on how states might build rainy day funds. By email, spokeswoman Sarah Leiseca passed along analyst Brenna Erford’s conclusion--drawing on Fiscal 50, a Pew interactive breaking out the fiscal status of each state--that Patrick got it wrong. At the moment, per Pew, Texas has $10.3 billion in reserve funds (rainy day funds plus ending balances) providing enough for state government to operate for 79.1 days. ""The only state with more reserve funds currently is Alaska, with $13.3 billion, providing enough for the state to operate for 181.9 days,"" Erford said.  SOURCE: Online interactive, Fiscal 50, Pew Charitable Trusts (chart received in an email from Sarah Leiseca, communications officer, Pew Charitable Trusts, attributing information to research by Brenna Erford, manager, state budget policy team, Pew Charitable Trusts, Feb. 26, 2015). Going forward, Erford noted, the NASBO fall 2014 report indicates Texas projecting a reserve balance of about $8 billion through the end of the 2015 fiscal year, which would run second to the projected year-end reserves for Alaska, $11.4 billion. ""According to these data, the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana, is greater than Texas’ reserves, providing clear evidence, Alaska withstanding, that Texas’ reserves are not more ‘than the other 49 states combined,’"" Erford said. NASBO charts With a nudge from Michael Leachman, a state budget expert at the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we spotted charts in the NASBO report indicating the 50 states together in fall 2014 were projecting 2015 fiscal-year-end reserves, meaning regular balances plus rainy day fund set-asides, of about $53 billion--with Texas accounting for $10.7 billion of that and Alaska $10 billion and other states all together projecting nearly $32 billion in ending reserves. An adjoining chart indicates Texas ending fiscal 2015 with $8 billion in its rainy day fund alone compared to other states together winding up with about $34 billion in such funds. Texas appears to have bigger balances than many states. But its predicted totals don’t dwarf all other states’ projected savings combined. Patrick: ‘Unintentional error’ After we looked over the charts, Patrick’s office told us Patrick made ""an unintentional error"" in the radio interview. By email, spokesman Alejandro Garcia said Patrick takes pride in the state stockpiling reserves, but he’d meant to talk up jobs created in Texas versus jobs created in all other states combined ""as he ad-libbed the comment."" Our ruling Patrick said Texas this year will ""have more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined."" On our inquiry, Patrick acknowledged this was a misstatement. Indeed, what he celebrated turned out to be incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

"['National', 'Criminal Justice', 'Sexuality', 'Ben Carson']","
Ben Carson: Many prisoners go in straight, come out gay
","Homosexuality is a choice, just look at the prisons, Republican neurosurgeon Ben Carson said on CNN. In a March 4 interview, the likely 2016 presidential contender said he believes that legalizing same-sex marriage is a decision that should be left to the states. He also argued that homosexuality is a choice, rather than biological. ""Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight -- and when they come out, they're gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question,"" said Carson, a former head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We’ll jump to the point here: There is no conclusive evidence to support Carson’s claim that ""a lot of people"" make a switch from heterosexual to homosexual while in prison. Further, the medical community tends to conclude that homosexuality is not a matter of choice -- notably the American Psychological Association. ""Dr. Carson's contention has a political intent but is absent of awareness of research on human sexuality,"" said Mark Fleisher, a social science professor at Case Western University, who studies sexuality and violence in prisons. A spokesman for Carson declined our request for comment. In the prisons Many inmates who identify as heterosexual change their sexual habits while in prison, possibly as a victim or perpetrator of abuse or due to lack of access to the opposite sex, said Christopher Hensley, a University of Tennessee at Chattanooga criminal justice professor. But a change in sexual behavior does not necessarily equate to a change in sexual orientation. Hensley recently authored a study that he said is one of the first to examine a shift in sexual orientation in prisons. He and his co-author questioned 142 prisoners at a maximum-security facility in the South about their sexual orientation. They found that of the sample, 24 men changed sexual orientation while incarcerated. Of those 24, 18 changed from straight to bisexual, three changed from bisexual to straight, and one each changed from bisexual to gay, gay to bisexual, and gay to straight. These results do not conclusively support Carson’s point, Hensley said. The sample size is too small to make any sweeping conclusions -- 142 is just about 0.001 percent of the nation’s prison population. Additionally, Hensley said his research does not support Carson’s implication that prison behavior shows that a shift in sexual orientation is a choice. Prison sex culture is not analogous to the sex culture outside of prison. ""Carson is taking a simplistic view of sexuality,"" Hensley said. It’s possible that people go into prison unaware of their sexuality, and then once they are exposed to homosexual behavior as an inmate, they realize that they are gay or bisexual, Helen Eigenberg, who also studies prison sexuality as a professor at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, said in an interview with PolitiFact. This isn’t necessarily captured in Hensley’s research, she said. Eigenberg added that sometimes victims of sexual abuse -- in prisons that can mean gang rape, prostitution or other forms of coercion -- are sometimes confused. They might think that just because they played a role in a homosexual act, they are now gay, which is not necessarily true. ""The fundamental assumption of the analogy (Carson’s) using is insane,"" Eigenberg told the Washington Post. We asked numerous other experts who study criminal justice and sexuality, and none agreed with Carson’s claim. Nor were they aware of modern research addressing this topic, other than Hensley’s. ""There is absolutely no good evidence supporting Carson's contention, and there is good evidence against it,"" said J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University who studies sexual orientation. A choice? In a previous PolitiFact article, we found that, while it’s not certain what factors cause sexuality, scientists agree that personal choice is not involved. The American Psychological Association, which has 150,000 members, considers it a ""settled question."" Greg Herek, a psychology professor at the University of California Davis who studies sexual orientation, pointed us to a nationally representative study that shows the vast majority of gay men and women do not perceive their sexual orientation as a result of choice. People can change their behavior -- such as engaging in homosexual behavior in prison -- but that does not equate to a change in orientation, Bailey, the Northwestern researcher, told PolitiFact. He also noted that there are examples (updated with new link) of boys being surgically changed into girls at birth (in the past, for medical reasons), but when these former boys grow into women -- they are attracted to other women. ""If you can't make a male attracted to men by changing him, surgically and socially, into a girl, how likely is it that prison can do that?"" Bailey said. Our ruling Carson said, ""A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay."" There is no research that supports this point. The one study that even begins to address the topic has too small a sample size -- and too many variables -- to shed light on Carson's claim. And its author finds Carson's view ""simplistic."" Further, Carson used this example to prove that sexual orientation is a personal decision. Respected scientists consider it settled that homosexuality is not a matter of choice. Additionally, experts told us the sex culture in prison is not comparable to sex culture outside of prison, making it a bad analogy. We rate Carson’s claim False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/04/ben-carson/ben-carson-many-prisoners-go-straight-come-out-gay/

Columnist: Obama presses gun control through bullet ban
","Segments of the gun-rights community are trying to block a proposed ban on certain kinds of bullets by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Paul Bedard, a columnist with the conservative Washington Examiner, recently took up the cry. ""President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control on the nation,"" Bedard wrote Feb. 27, 2015. ""Targeting the top-selling rifle in the country, the AR-15 style semi-automatic, with a ban on one of the most-used AR bullets by sportsmen and target shooters."" We left phone messages and sent emails several times to Bedard and did not hear back. Our focus is whether Obama is using executive action to impose gun control through a bullet ban.  There’s some information to unpack here. Where the claim comes from Though we didn’t hear back from Bedard, he’s talking about the ATF’s plan for one particular type of bullet -- a 5.56 mm ""green tip."" It is found in SS109 and M855 cartridges, and it’s one of the more popular types of ammunition in America, experts told us. But this February, the ATF announced a proposal to remove an exemption that allowed gun owners to use this particular kind of ammunition. The agency’s reasoning? It can pierce the sort of body armor often worn by police, and it can be fired from a handgun. The ammunition isn’t new, nor is its ability to pierce body armor. What is new is that gun manufacturers are making handguns that use a 5.56 mm ""green tip."" That, ATF says, violates the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1985 that aimed to ban armor piercing bullets. ""The AR-based handguns and rifles utilize the same magazines and share identical receivers,"" the ATF wrote in an explanatory brief. ""These AR-type handguns were not commercially available when the armor piercing ammunition exemption was granted in 1986. To ensure consistency, upon final implementation of the sporting purpose framework outlined above, ATF must withdraw the exemptions for 5.56 mm ""green tip"" ammunition, including both the SS109 and M855 cartridges."" The public has until March 16 to comment on the proposal. ATF will assess those comments and then issue a final ruling. It has not said when it will decide. Nearly 240 members of Congress signed a letter to ATF opposing the change. ‘Using executive actions’ That’s the background. Now how does that jibe with Bedard’s claim? Bedard called this an executive action by the president. That is a stretch of the common reading of the phrase.  Yes, ATF is part of the executive branch, but there’s no evidence this was a decision made by Obama (compared to, say, Obama’s executive action on immigration.) ATF said the proposal came after it received 30 requests for exemptions to permit this sort of bullet in handguns between 2011 and today. Until then, the agency said it had received few such requests. ATF spokeswoman Janice Kemp told PunditFact ""this started with us."" When this issue came up in a daily White House press briefing, press secretary Josh Earnest said this was an ATF process that was open to public comment. (The comment period ends on March 16.) However, he said the administration supports the proposal as a ""common sense"" step. ""This seems to be an area where everyone should agree that if there are armor-piercing bullets available that can fit into easily concealed weapons, that it puts our law enforcement at considerably more risk,"" Earnest said. ‘Impose gun control on the nation’ Bedard also said Obama’s actions ""impose gun control on the nation."" That claim is also a stretch of the common meaning of the phrase. The ATF says that banning this particular kind of bullet would leave gunowners with 168 other varieties of bullets to use in the same weapons. Bullets made with copper or lead remain legal under the 1986 law. Steven Howard, a Michigan attorney and firearms specialist, agrees with ATF’s basic point.  ""Instead of shooting this particular cartridge with the forbidden bullet, you’d still have a whole bunch of different ones that you could run through,"" he said. ""A lot of this is fear mongering more than anything else. People are afraid that the list of banned ammo will grow."" (Howard among them, he told us.) Another important point: People who already have these bullets could still use them, but they wouldn’t be able to get any more in the future.   That said, removing the exemption for this type of bullet would have consequences. Sam Raheb owns Close Focus Research, a ballistics testing lab in California. Raheb said the main impact on shooters is that their ammunition might cost more. ""Before this, you could get a green-point for about 40 cents a round,"" Raheb said. ""If you had to buy a commercial hunting grade cartridge, it could cost you $1 a round."" Kyle Weaver, the National Rifle Association’s executive director of operations also cited cost during a recent interview. Weaver was asked about the effect on shooter training. ""This is the inexpensive ammo they train with and shoot with,"" Weaver said. ""This is not the high-end stuff. This is what they shoot every day."" And Wes Mason, manager of technical operations at another testing center, HP White Laboratory, said the proposal wouldn’t address other types of handgun ammunition that could pierce armor and would still be legal under the proposed change.   ""Its counterparts have the same characteristics when you’re talking about piercing body armor,"" Mason said. That would make the proposal ineffective in protecting police. Lastly, Bedard said the administration was targeting the rifle version of the AR-15. That is his interpretation. It is the pistol version that drew the ATF’s attention. The agency’s proposal would leave both the pistol and rifle versions untouched, although the ammunition for both would be affected if the ""green tip"" is banned. Our ruling Bedard said Obama was using executive action to impose gun control through a ban on certain bullets. An executive agency, the ATF, has proposed removing an exemption for a specific type of ammunition because gun manufacturers have started selling handguns that fire the rounds. That violates a 1986 federal law, the ATF says, aimed at protecting police from armor piercing bullets. Bedard’s shorthanding this as ""executive action"" is misleading, though Obama does support the proposal.   Also, it’s worth noting that the ban would not amount to gun control per se; the ATF notes that 168 other varieties of bullets will work in the same weapons. The primary impact would be a higher price for ammunition. And while Bedard says the move targets the rifle version, it is the pistol version and the cartridges it uses that lie at the center of the ATF proposal. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give another impression. We rate it Mostly False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

Phil Robertson off target at CPAC: 110 million Americans do not have 'sexually transmitted illness'
","At the annual CPAC convention -- a multi-day gathering that draws conservative politicians and activists to the Washington, D.C., area -- there were lots of speakers in suits and ties. And then there was Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the family featured on the A&E reality show Duck Dynasty, sporting his signature salt-and-pepper beard and a camouflage-colored bandana. Robertson, who was at CPAC to accept an award, gave a stemwinder of a speech on conservative values, which play a big role in his TV show. At one point, he brought up the topic of sexually transmitted diseases. ""I got my facts from the CDC the day before yesterday,"" Robertson told the crowd on Feb. 27, 2015. ""One hundred and ten million -- 110 million! -- Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness. One hundred and ten million? I’m looking at it, I said"" -- here Robertson sighs -- ""I don’t want you, America, to get sick. I don’t want you to become ill. I don’t want you to come down with a debilitating disease. I don’t want you to die early."" Robertson’s CDC statistic certainly got our attention, since the entire U.S. population was roughly 309 million in 2012, according to the Census Bureau. This would mean that, for Robertson to be right, well over one-third of Americans must have a ""sexually transmitted illness."" And once you subtract children under 15, the percentage would rise to 44 percent. Those are big percentages. Is Robertson right on the numbers?  The short answer is no, but we can see why Robertson thought his stat was correct. (We contacted A&E Networks, Robertson’s publisher and several speakers’ bureaus that feature Robertson, but we did not get any response.) The CDC prominently uses the number 110 million in reference to sexually transmitted diseases. In February 2013, the CDC published a document titled ""Fact Sheet: Incidence, Prevalence, and Cost of Sexually Transmitted Infections in the United States."" In it, the CDC wrote, ""CDC published an overall estimate of the number of prevalent STIs (sexually transmitted infections) in the nation. Prevalence is the total number of new and existing infections at a given time. CDC’s new data suggest that there are more than 110 million total STIs among men and women across the nation."" CDC also plays up the 110 million figure several times in the fact sheet’s headlines and graphical elements. Here's how Robertson used it incorrectly. Not Americans, ‘infections’ First, the study doesn’t refer to 110 million Americans -- it refers to 110 million infections. The distinction is everything. People can -- and do -- have more than one different infection, or they may contract the same infection more than once. To come up with the 110 million estimate, each of these infections would have been counted individually. The list of infections represented in the figure includes chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus type 2, HIV, human papillomavirus, syphilis and trichomoniasis. The CDC did not provide us the number of Americans who have a sexually transmitted infection, and it's not clear that such a number exists. Not necessarily an ‘illness’ The second issue with Robertson’s phrasing is that he uses the word ""illness"" instead of infection. In reality, while infected individuals can pass along an infection, and while they are at risk of getting sick themselves, the vast majority of individuals with infections are not actually ill. Simply put, you don't get ill just because you're infected. The lion’s share of infections -- almost three-quarters of the 110 million infections -- come from human papillomavirus, commonly known as HPV. This virus can cause several types of cancer, including cervical cancer, but only for a small percentage of people infected. The vast majority are not ""ill"" by any reasonable definition. According to CDC, ""the body’s immune system clears most HPV naturally within two years (about 90 percent), though some infections persist. … Most sexually active men and women will get HPV at some point in their lives."" By contrast, the four most worrisome diseases included in the study -- syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and HIV -- account for about 1.5 percent of the total number of infections. What the experts say How problematic is Robertson’s framing of the issue? Two experts we checked with expressed concern. Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, called Robertson’s emphasis on the 110 million figure ""fear-mongering."" By way of comparison, Caplan said, ""would be to say more than 200 million of us have viruses and bacteria that come from — breathing and touching each other! They are widespread, serious and sometimes fatal — flu, pneumonia, TB, measles, enteroviruses, respiratory viruses, MRSA, meningitis etc."" So is the answer, he said, to ""be a hermit? Do not breathe around others?"" Thomas Fekete, section chief for infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine, also cautioned against over-reading the CDC’s figures. ""We have always had STIs in this country, and we have done some good things to reduce their burden on our citizens,"" Fekete said. Our ruling Robertson said that, according to the CDC, ""110 million Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness."" The figure isn't out of thin air -- it has been touted aggressively by the CDC -- but Robertson describes its meaning incorrectly. There are 110 million infections -- not people who are infected -- and only a small percentage of infected individuals are considered to have an ""illness."" The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/04/phil-robertson/phil-robertson-duck-dynasty-says-110-million-ameri/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Military', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says in presidential field, he's sole individual to have served in military
","Rick Perry stresses his military service in a web ad noted by Politico on Feb. 27, 2015, describing himself as unique among milling presidential prospects. ""At this particular point in time, looking at the field,"" Perry tells listeners around a table, ""there’s only one individual that’s ever had the uniform of his country on—and that’s me."" The Politico story went on: ""No other 2016 presidential contender — except for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), arguably a long-shot candidate — has served in the military."" According to the Associated Press, Graham said in January 2015 he’d set up a committee to explore running for president. Perry’s biographical entry, on his website, says: ""Between 1972 and 1977, Perry served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East."" And when the then-governor of Texas ran for president in 2012, he was nearly the only candidate with a military record, The Washington Post said in an Aug. 16, 2011, news blog post;  the only other candidate with military experience was Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, formerly a flight surgeon in the Air Force and the Air Force National Guard. Paul has since left the House and the presidential hustings, seemingly giving buoyance to this new claim. Prospects who have worn the uniform Perry aides did not respond to our inquiry about how Perry reached his ""only one individual"" conclusion. So we don’t know why he overlooked Graham, whose time as an Air Force lawyer is mentioned in his Senate biographical entry. By email, Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop said Graham was a senior prosecutor at Rhein-Main Air Force Base in Germany from 1984-1988. He left active duty in 1989, but remains a colonel in the Air Force Reserves, Bishop said. It's worth noting, too, that no candidate has already declared for president, a factor leading us to root our review of Perry's declaration in a list of Americans believed to be considering a run. The list is kept up by Politics1.com, a website run by Florida attorney Ron Gunzburger that tracks candidates for federal office. And it looks like besides Perry and Graham, a couple of possible longshot Republican hopefuls could be stumping with military experience: --Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was a U.S. Army counterintelligence agent in West Germany before entering the University of Virginia Law School, from which he graduated in 1977, according to a biographical entry posted by the National Governors Association. Gilmore’s entry in Who’s Who specifies  he was an Army agent in West Germany from 1971-74. In December 2014, Gilmore declined to rule out a presidential bid in an interview with The Washington Post. --Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who like Perry spoke at the February 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference, spent time in the National Guard (signing up, he’s said, because he wanted to diminish his chances of dying in a rice paddy in Vietnam). In January 2015, The Boston Globe quoted Bolton, then about to venture to New Hampshire (home to the nation’s first-every-four-years presidential primaries), saying he was considering a run for president. Democrat fought in Vietnam In his video, Perry--who has said he’ll reveal if he’s running for president in May or June 2015--didn’t say if he was limiting his focus to Republicans. If not, he also overlooked former Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, who was a Marine in Vietnam before later serving as Secretary of the Navy. Webb served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1972 as a second lieutenant and platoon commander in Vietnam, according to Who’s Who. In a video posted online as he launched his presidential exploratory committee in November 2014, Webb said: ""I came from a family of citizen-soldiers"" including his father, a 26-year pilot. ""My brother, my son and I all became Marines. I fought on one of the Vietnam war’s harshest battlefields,"" Webb said, adding that he spent eight years on active duty. Bush to Walker to Biden to O’Malley; no military service touted Biographical information posted online by more than a dozen other possible Republican candidates or groups didn’t reveal a personal military record for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; surgeon Ben Carson; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz; business executive Carly Fiorina; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; Ohio Gov. John Kasich; former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; Indiana Gov. Mike Pence; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul; former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum; Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder; and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Similarly, possible Democratic aspirants--Vice President Joe Biden; former Secretary of State/former Sen. Hillary Clinton; and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley--show no military background in their lives. What to make of all of this? Next, we queried a Duke University political scientist, Peter Feaver, who offered his opinion by email: ""If the field of prospects is limited to what Gov. Perry would plausibly consider to be the Republican top tier, meaning those who poll at his level or higher, then his statement is demonstrably true. None of the Republican candidates that are currently running ahead of Perry in the polls has served in uniform."" Feaver continued: ""If the field of prospects is expanded to include every person who has expressed an interest in running for president, then of course some of that vast multitude have served in uniform."" Our ruling In a web video, Perry said: ""At this particular point in time, looking at the field, there’s only one individual that’s ever had the uniform of his country on—and that’s me."" Perhaps Perry’s definition of the ""field"" leaves out possible aspirants who haven’t surged in early polls. We also can see Perry making a case for being the best-known possible Republican nominee with military experience. However, there are others who might bid—a sitting senator, another former governor, a former ambassador and a Democratic former senator—who also were in the military. On balance, we rate his absolute statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 5:10 p.m., March 4, 2015: We updated this story by adding details of Graham's military service, drawing on information provided by his spokesman.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Elections', 'States', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
With 2016 on the horizon, Scott Walker asserts his appeal among Republicans and independents
","As he explores a run for the White House, Scott Walker is making a case for his electability, citing the fact he has won three elections for governor in four years. But he gives particular focus to the margins in his 2014 re-election victory. On Feb. 26, 2015, Walker spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference, along with a host of other Republicans who are pondering a presidential run in 2016. The same day, he did an interview with Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity. Hannity's first question went to Walker’s electability: ""How does a Republican win in Wisconsin because, on a presidential level, they haven't won since '84?"" That was the year Ronald Reagan won a second term in a landslide. Since then, the state has gone Democratic seven straight times. ""You've got to go big and you've got to go bold,"" Walker replied. He continued by describing his 2014 win for a second term, over Democrat Mary Burke: ""I mean, ironically, I had solid support. In fact, I think more than any Republican governor in the country, I took a higher percentage of the Republican vote this last go-around, and yet I also carried independents by 12 points.""   We wondered about the numbers in Walker’s claim, one he repeated several days later in an interview with Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday."" So, did Walker win a higher percentage of the Republican vote in 2014 than any other Republican governor? And did he also win independent voters by a margin of 12 points? 2014 exit polls Edison Research does exit polling for five TV networks and the Associated Press. The key data for this fact check are found in the responses to this question: ""No matter how you voted today, do you usually think of yourself as a Democrat, Republican, independent or something else."" The results showed that three incumbent Republicans won at least 95 percent of the GOP vote in gubernatorial races (the GOP incumbent who won re-election with the lowest share of the GOP vote was Sam Brownback of Kansas, at 80 percent):   Governor  Percentage of Republican vote Terry Branstad, Iowa            97% Scott Walker, Wisconsin 96% John Kasich, Ohio 95% Two notes: Republican Greg Abbott won 96 percent of the GOP vote in winning the Texas governor's race. But he was running for an open seat. And exit polls, like any poll, have a margin of error and the difference between 96 percent and 97 percent are within the margin of error. At the same time, they are the best numbers available. So, Walker’s Republican support was extremely high, but not quite the highest. (On the other side, Walker won only 6 percent of the vote from Democrats. That 90-point partisan gap -- 96 percent of the GOP vote versus 6 percent of the Democratic vote – was the biggest of any 2014 candidate for governor in states where exit polls were done, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Craig Gilbert, who writes The Wisconsin Voter blog.) As for the second part of Walker’s claim, the Wisconsin exit poll found that among voters who identified themselves as independent or something else, Walker outperformed Burke by 54 percent to 43 percent. That’s a margin of 11 points, one point less than what Walker claimed. Our rating Walker said that more than any Republican governor in the 2014 elections, ""I took a higher percentage of the Republican vote"" and ""yet I also carried independents by 12 points."" Exit polls show both parts of the claim are slightly off. Walker’s 96 percent support from Republicans was second to Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad’s 97 percent. And among independent voters in Wisconsin, Walker led Democratic challenger Mary Burke by 11 points, not 12. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, Walker earns a Mostly True.   To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.",/factchecks/2015/mar/04/scott-walker/2016-horizon-scott-walker-asserts-his-appeal-among/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott: Average Floridian pays $1,800 in state taxes, lowest in country
","Florida Gov. Rick Scott rattled off a laundry list of first-term accomplishments during his State of the State speech March 3, 2015. Chief among them were his efforts to cut taxes in the Sunshine State the past four years. ""We are home to over 250 languages. We are at a 43-year-low in our crime rate. We are absolutely the best melting pot in the world. Housing prices are up. And taxes are down,"" Scott said. ""We have cut taxes more than 40 times in the last four years. We have no personal income tax and the average person only pays about $1,800 in state taxes — which is the lowest of all 50 states."" As we said in another fact-check, the bit about cutting taxes more than 40 times rates Half True. Here, we decided to look at Scott’s claim that the average person pays $1,800 a year in state taxes, the lowest of all 50 states. We crunched the numbers ourselves and compared that to multiple other tax watchdogs that use U.S. Census data to calculate taxes collected per capita. According to the Florida Department of Revenue, the state collected about $33.6 billion in taxes in fiscal year 2014. In 2013, Florida’s population, according to the U.S. Census, was about 19.6 million. Do the math, and that’s $1,711 taxes collected per capita. Scott’s office pointed us to the Federation of Tax Administrators, a nonpartisan group that serves the principal tax collection agencies in all 50 states. A 2013 analysis based on data from the U.S. Census, which surveys every state government each year to ask how much they collected in taxes, found the taxes Florida collected per capita were $1,769. That number was also cited by the Kaiser Family Foundation, another nonpartisan organization. Both those figures are close to the number Scott cited. But there’s a notable difference between taxes collected per capita and how much ""the average person pays,"" as Scott put it. To arrive at the per capita figure, you’re including millions of people, namely children, who either pay no taxes or some nominal amount (the sales tax on a toy purchased with allowance money, for example). With this caveat in mind, looking at taxes collected per capita is still a useful tool for comparing tax burdens across state lines. It’s not a perfect comparison — some states may have larger proportions of their residents who pay taxes — but it is used by several national tax policy groups. The most recent estimates say Florida's state tax burden is among the lowest in the country.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Federation of Tax Administrators, at $1,769, Florida’s tax burden in 2013 was the lowest in the country, beating out Georgia ($1,781), New Hampshire ($1,791), South Dakota ($1,815) and South Carolina ($1,827). At $7,325 per person, North Dakota’s state tax burden is the highest. Our own calculation, achieved by comparing the U.S. Census 2013 Annual Survey of State Government Tax Collections to 2013 population data, put Florida third, behind New Hampshire and Georgia.   The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture from the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, ranked Florida fourth in its most recent analysis from 2012. Lastly, if you think per capita is a silly way of comparing tax liabilities, know that Florida has a low tax burden by another measure: percent of total income paid to taxes. According to the Federation of Tax Administrators, 4.4 percent of all income earned by Floridians goes to state taxes. That percentage is the third-lowest in the country behind New Hampshire (3.7 percent) and South Dakota (4.1 percent). Our ruling Scott said, ""The average person only pays about $1,800 in state taxes — which is the lowest of all 50 states."" That’s not exactly what the average person pays in taxes; it’s actually the state taxes collected per capita, which factors in children and other residents who pay little to nothing in taxes. That’s not necessarily the impression you would get from Scott’s statement. Still, according to two credible analyses, that number was the lowest in the country in 2013, the last year of available data. Other breakdowns put Florida among four states with the lowest tax burden per capita. We rate Scott’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-average-floridian-pays-1800-state-taxes/

Rick Scott says he cut taxes 'more than 40 times'
","Gov. Rick Scott has been touting his record of tax-cutting for years now, but in his March 3, 2015, State of the State address, he said he’s been pulling out the red pen even more. ""We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years,"" Scott said during his speech to open the 2015 legislative session. That’s a lot of instances of cutting Floridians’ taxes. Scott said during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign he’d cut taxes 40 times, but the ""more"" part piqued our interest. But what does Scott consider a tax cut, and how many times has he cut them? We took a closer look to try to break the code. Scott’s tally Scott said in 2013 he considered a tax cut to be a change that reduced government revenue by $3 million in any one year. He altered his definition in 2014 to include more revenue reductions for less than $3 million as tax cuts. That means he included things that weren’t, strictly speaking, an outright reduction in a single tax rate -- like sales tax holidays, stopping automatic fee hikes, tax credits and some temporary measures. He then counted each instance of some things every time they happened (so, for example, the annual back-to-school sales tax holiday is counted multiple times). Scott’s people didn’t get back to us with new information immediately, but in May 2014 they shared with us a list that included 41 items, so that may explain the ""more than 40 times"" part of it. In no particular order they are (with estimated savings in parentheses): 1, 2.) Unemployment compensation taxes: The Legislature reduced the number of weeks and payout for unemployment compensation in 2011 ($124.5 million). A tax increase for businesses was rolled back in 2012, although not eliminated. ($830 million for tax years 2012-14). 3, 4.) Manufacturing equipment: A 2012 sales tax exemption on machinery purchases was expanded ($56 million). In 2013, the Legislature eliminated the sales tax entirely for three years, starting April 30, 2014 ($370 million in state taxes and and $83 million in local government taxes through 2017). 5.) Property taxes: Scott and legislators forced most state water management districts to reduce their property tax collections by 30 percent in 2011 ($210 million). 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) Sales tax holiday: Scott counted the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday four different times prior to 2013. It applied to shoes and clothing up to $75 per item and school supply purchases up to $15. The state has offered the holiday every year since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. The Aug. 2-4 tax holiday counted twice, according to Scott, because it also exempted sales taxes on electronic equipment, such as E-readers, laptops and tablets, up to $750 (about $30 million for all four holidays). For 2014, there were three sales tax holidays: From May 31-June 8, 2014, for Floridians to buy hurricane preparedness supplies without paying 6 percent ($2.9 million); A three-day back-to-school shopping period from Aug. 1-3 was for clothes worth $100 or less, school supplies worth $15 or less, or on the first $750 of the cost of a personal computer (about $30 million); and Sept. 19-21 on the purchase of energy- and water-efficient appliances costing $1,500 or less (about $1.7 million). 13, 14.) Corporate Income Tax exemptions: Lawmakers expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and then all the way up to $50,000 in 2012 (about $60 million). 15.) Tax credit scholarships: A program that gives businesses a tax credit if they purchase tuition vouchers for low-income families to go to private schools was expanded ($25 million). 16, 17, 18.) Energy breaks: A 2013 law implemented part of a 2008 constitutional amendment that says a property appraiser may not base an increase in a property’s just value on the installation of a ""renewable energy source device,"" including windmills, solar panels and roof pools (local revenue losses of $12.6 million by 2017). Two other tax credits from 2012 aimed at helping agribusiness and renewable energy production facilities are set to expire in 2016. Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.) Various business tax incentives: Since 2011, Scott and the Legislature have expanded tax credits available to businesses under a federal/state ""new markets"" program, allowing businesses to take it against their corporate income tax bill or insurance premium tax bill ($12.9 million per year). They’ve allowed companies that spent at least $250 million on capital costs from 2011-13 to write-down a portion of their Florida business taxes ($7.5 million). They temporarily waived a requirement that a new facility creating at least 100 jobs be in certain technology fields in order to qualify for the Capital Investment Tax Credit, though only if they are located in certain Panhandle counties. The exemption lasted through June 30, 2014 ($4.4 million per year). They also created an annual corporate income tax credit for certain research and development expenses (up to $9 million a year). In 2014 businesses won a small decrease on the tax rate on electricity ($3 million) and allowed a sales tax refund on bad credit card debt (about $6.7 million). 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.) Targeted breaks: Lawmakers eliminated sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds ($12.3 million). The same bill tweaked requirements for a tax credit for businesses in an urban high-crime area ($3.5 million per year). The Legislature blocked a July 2013 automatic inflation adjustment factored in registration for hunting and fishing license fees every five years ($4.4 million for 2012-13). A wide-ranging 2012 law eliminated the annual adjustment and surcharge for severing phosphate ($12.6 million annually). A person licensed as a real estate salesperson or broker associate does not have to apply for an exemption from a local business tax when he or she is an employee of someone else under a 2012 law ($3.8 million from local government per year). A portion of the 2014 tax cut package clarified how prepaid calling plans were taxed ($7.2 million). It also contained provisions to cut taxes for premiums on bail bonds ($700,000) and title insurance ($5.4 million). The bill also extended and increased financial incentives for businesses to donate to community development and housing projects for low-income residents by providing a tax credit or sales tax refund ($14.7 million). 34.) Communications dealers: A 2012 law spared communications dealers, in certain situations, from being liable for penalties if they assign a customer to the wrong local tax jurisdiction ($4.7 million annually). 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.) Sales tax exemptions: The tax cut package from 2014’s HB 5601 included several exemptions for more than just businesses. There was a temporary $3.3 million cut for the purchase of cement mixing drums for cement trucks, but the list also includes child car seats and youth bike helmets (about $2.5 million), prescribed diet pet food (another $2.5 million or so) and prepaid college meal plans (about $12 million). These exemptions are in effect until 2017. 41.) Car registration fees: In 2014, the Legislature rolled back the 2009 annual auto tag fee increase. Those fees had gone up to deal with a budget shortfall. The fee cut took effect in September 2014 and saves motorists about $25 a year per vehicle registration (about $395 million annually). Adding it up So that totals 41, but do they really count as tax cuts? It depends on how you look at it, experts have told PolitiFact Florida. If you’re a business, some of the changes are a real benefit. But if you’re a regular, taxpaying Floridian, there’s not a whole lot here for you -- especially if you need to collect unemployment. Sales tax holidays can change from year to year, and exemptions are temporary. Tax credits only save you money if you spend it somewhere else, and preventing property appraisals from going up if you improve the property means you still have to improve the property. Ending a fee increase isn’t so much a cut as it is saving people from paying more for something they have to pay anyway, like a hunting or fishing license. And don’t forget that many times, local governments may raise taxes to make up for their own lost revenue. Scott has requested several tax changes for 2015, but it is up to the Legislature to approve them. Our ruling Scott said, ""We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years."" A list his office sent us last year with 41 things they considered tax cuts likely explains that sum. But the list is full of esoteric tax credits, changes in unemployment compensation and sales tax holidays that don’t meet the purest definition of a tax cut. Scott’s tax claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-cut-taxes-more-40-times/
"['Immigration', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Already this year, Greg Abbott says, over 20,000 immigrants caught after crossing border into U.S.
","In a nationally televised interview, the governor of Texas said the border with Mexico remains unsecured — and offered up a figure as evidence. On CBS’s ""Face the Nation,"" Abbott predicted a Texas-led court challenge to President Barack Obama’s actions shielding millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation would end up at the Supreme Court. Reporter Bob Schieffer then asked if Abbott thought Congress should proceed to fully funding the Department of Homeland Security rather than keep pushing a Republican-steered proposal to tie continued funding to repealing Obama’s immigration actions. Abbott replied, in part, that: ""...the first thing that we want to get out of Washington, D.C., is full funding to secure the border. The reason why we're in this problem to begin with is because the federal government has not stepped up to fulfill its duty to secure the border… Already this calendar year, since Jan. 1, we have had more than 20,000 people come across the border, apprehended, unauthorized. And so we have an ongoing problem on the border that Congress must step up and solve."" We were curious about the 20,000-plus count. Abbott’s office didn’t engage when we inquired, but Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, separately emailed us a Feb. 18, 2015, agency document, ""Texas Border Security Dashboard,"" including a chart stating that 21,808 ""illegal aliens"" had been arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol since Jan. 1, 2015, in the agency’s Texas sectors, including 14,281 in its busy Rio Grande Valley sector. Vinger said the counts were current as of approximately Feb. 18. Federal confirmation unavailable Our attempts to match those figures with information provided by the Border Patrol fell short. Spokesman Carlos Lazo said by email he didn’t have February 2015 apprehension totals. Separately, El Paso-based Border Patrol spokesman Doug Mosier emailed a chart indicating that in January 2015, 21,518 individuals were apprehended in the agency’s Southwest sector, covering Texas to San Diego, Calif. From that chart, we calculated that 13,289 people were apprehended in the Texas sectors that month, 8,427 of them in the Rio Grande Valley. Such arrests down from 2014? Uncertain Given that Abbott offered his figure as an indicator of border insecurity, we wondered how the government’s Texas apprehensions in January 2015 compared with such arrests in previous Januarys. To make that comparison, we turned to a Border Patrol presentation showing month-by-month counts from 2000 through most of 2014. Upshot: The 13,289 January 2015 Border Patrol apprehensions on the Texas side of the Rio Grande ran 5,409 behind some 18,698 apprehensions the same month a year earlier.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott calls proposed per pupil spending 'historic'
","Gov. Rick Scott used his annual opening address to the 2015 Legislature to talk about some of his favorite subjects -- taxes, business and his newfound penchant for spending more on education. SEE RICK SCOTT'S STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH ANNOTATED. ""If we are going to out-compete the world, we must invest in K-12 education,"" he said. ""This year, we are recommending an increase in K-12 funding to $50 above the historic level to $7,176 per student."" That’s a change from Scott’s first year in office, when he recommended the Legislature slash $3.3 billion out of the education budget as Florida’s budget floundered during the recession. (They eventually cut $1.3 billion.) He has since reversed course, recommending additional funding each year as tax revenues and the state's economy rebounded. Let’s check the numbers to see if Scott’s per-pupil spending really is a historic high. Accounting for education K-12 education gets most of its money through the Florida Education Finance Program, a combination of state and local funding. School districts contribute property tax dollars, called the ""required local effort,"" at a rate set by the state. Florida received federal stimulus dollars a couple of recent years, too. Total education spending became a flashpoint during the 2014 campaign when challenger and former Gov. Charlie Crist attacked Scott’s education spending. Scott responded by saying he now oversaw the highest education budget in state spending. But that was only true in total dollars, not per-pupil spending. After Crist said he held the record for spending per student, which many education advocates have said is a better method for measuring, Scott said he would raise the 2015-16 number to $50 higher than Crist’s record. That led to this year’s budget recommendation, which asks the Legislature for a $19.75 billion K-12 budget, working out to $7,176 per student. To keep track of it, let’s look at this table: Fiscal year K-12 budget (total) Per pupil spending 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,769 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,915 2015-16 (Scott --  recommended) $19.75 billion $7,176 The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida raked in about $900 million each in federal stimulus money to keep the budget afloat. Also note that for 2015-16, Scott’s proposal is a recommendation only; the Legislature ultimately will decide school funding levels. We should note some other caveats about Scott’s increased spending: First of all, remember that Florida schools have more students now than they did when Crist was in office. A current student total won’t be available until enrollments for next year are finished and added up, but in 2014-15 there were somewhere around 100,000 more students than in 2007. Overall spending would have to go up just to keep pace. Secondly, even though proposed spending could be increased $50, that hardly keeps up with the inflation realized in the eight-year span since Crist was in office. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator (an imperfect measure, to be sure, but a good benchmark), Scott would have to increase spending by an additional $850 or so to even match what per-pupil spending was in 2007. When we account for inflation, 2007’s $7,126 per-student funding comes out to $8,032 today. Our ruling Scott said his recommendation of education funding of $7,176 per student is a ""historic level."" That’s accurate only if you don’t account for inflation, which has ticked up each year since the previous per-student spending high in 2007-08. The claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/scott-calls-proposed-pupil-spending-historic/

Bill O'Reilly: 'I never said I was on the Falkland Islands'
","Bill O’Reilly’s accounts of his early years as a reporter have garnered a lot of attention lately, especially his experiences in the 1980s during the Falklands War. For those who might not remember, a full-blown battle broke out in 1982 when Argentina sought to claim the islands that had long been held by the United Kingdom. The scrutiny of the iconic Fox News host began with a Mother Jones article by David Corn and Daniel Schulman. It asserted, ""For years, O'Reilly has recounted dramatic stories about his own war reporting that don't withstand scrutiny — even claiming he acted heroically in a war zone that he apparently never set foot in."" O’Reilly has aggressively defended his reputation. ""David Corn, a liar, says that I exaggerated situations in the Falklands War and Salvadoran War,"" O’Reilly said on his Feb. 20, 2015, show. ""I never said I was on the Falkland Islands, as Corn purports. I said I covered the Falklands War, which I did."" The full scope of the dispute over O’Reilly’s past actions is larger than a single fact-check, but here we will attempt to address O’Reilly’s statement that ""I never said I was on the Falklands Islands."" The Falklands War -- a primer The Falkland Islands lie about 400 miles off the southern coast of Argentina. There are two main islands and hundreds of smaller ones. Today, there about 3,000 residents and around half a million sheep. Britain claimed the islands in 1765. By the 1960s, Argentina was pushing hard to assert its own rights to the territory, which it called the Malvinas. The argument simmered until April 1982 when Argentine troops landed on the islands. Britain sent 100 war ships, fighter jets and infantry to repulse them. Britain sank an Argentine cruiser. Argentina bombed British landing craft. The fighting lasted about two and a half months until Argentina surrendered. By that point, it had lost about 650 men; about 250 British soldiers had died. During all this time, no American journalists were on the ground on the islands themselves. Most of the coverage originated from Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, over 1,000 miles from the fighting. When the British forces won, huge riots broke out around the presidential palace. Thousands took to the streets in frustration over the lost war. There was violence, tear gas, rock-throwing and rubber bullets fired. There were injuries and property damage, but to the best of anyone’s knowledge, no one died. Bill O’Reilly --  a primer Everyone knows O’Reilly as the brash, ""no-spin zone"" Fox News host, but before taking up with Fox in 1996, O’Reilly had spent many years working his way up through network television. He had reporting jobs in cities including Dallas, Denver and Portland, Ore. His big break came in 1982 when he became a correspondent for CBS News. While at CBS, he was sent to Buenos Aires to cover the Falklands War. It was there that he saw the riots that he has referred to as a war zone. In fact, O’Reilly felt CBS never gave him the credit he deserved for the reporting he did when the rioting was most intense. O’Reilly moved to ABC News in 1986, and then left to become the host of a news and entertainment show called Inside Edition. He stayed in that slot until 1995 when he went to Harvard’s Kennedy School to get a degree in public policy. The Fox News network was just getting started when O’Reilly graduated and he became host of the show that soon became known as The O’Reilly Factor. O’Reilly and the Falklands O’Reilly’s accounts of his time in Argentina go into most detail when he describes helping a cameraman who was knocked down and cut his ear, and about soldiers firing on protesters. The rest of the time, his references to the war have been more in passing. The Mother Jones article included several instances when O’Reilly talked or wrote about the Falklands. For example, it cited a line from O’Reilly’s book The No Spin Zone: Confrontations With the Powerful and Famous in America, that said, ""I've reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands."" There are also two video clips of O’Reilly referring to his Falklands experiences. In one, O’Reilly chides journalist Bill Moyers, saying, ""I missed Moyers in the war zones of the Falkland conflict in Argentina, the Middle East and Northern Ireland. I looked for Bill, but I didn't see him."" Our search of the Nexis database unearthed an instance on Feb. 13, 2007, when O’Reilly talked on his show about the Falklands. He was interviewing two reporters who had covered the Iraq War. One of them, Mark Kukis with Time magazine, described what it was like to interview soldiers. Kukis: ""The soldiers that I was in combat with in those moments, they get really psyched up and they're excited, particularly the Marines in Ramadi. It's not a bad time to talk to them about what they're doing. It's probably the best time if you want to get a positive response from them."" O'Reilly: ""Okay. See, my experience in El Salvador, in the Falklands War was let them calm down. Because ... when all hell breaks loose, you know, you're not thinking clearly. You're reacting."" While there’s some wiggle room for interpretation, a reasonable person would think that O’Reilly had been with soldiers in combat in the Falklands. In another video clip used by Mother Jones, O’Reilly was a little more ambiguous. ""I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete."" Interpreting O’Reilly’s statements Ultimately, this fact-check is an exercise in the art of language. Namely, did O’Reilly never say he was on the Falklands islands? Two media critics, one from Fox News and one from Politico said this is a dispute over semantics. Fox News said in a statement that ""This is nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates Mother Jones and Media Matters."" Under some circumstances, ""in"" can mean ""during,"" as in ""What did you do in the war, Daddy?"" Daddy might have slogged through the swamps of Vietnam or he might have worked a desk in a Pentagon office. On the other hand, it’s not much of a stretch for a listener to conclude that O’Reilly’s statements meant that he had been on the same ground where the actual fighting took place. Certainly during his interview with war reporters, O’Reilly strongly implied that he had been with soldiers in combat ""in the Falklands War."" Even experienced listeners have stumbled over his meaning. Our ruling O’Reilly said, ""I never said I was on the Falkland Islands."" The central word here is ""on."" O’Reilly has a point that — at least so far as we can tell — he’s always said he was ""in"" the Falklands conflict rather than ""on"" the islands. At the very least, we can say that when O’Reilly talked about the Falklands in the past, his phrasing was ambiguous — to the extent that reasonable people could understand him to mean he’d set foot in a place where military combat was taking place, not reporting from 1,000 miles away. Also, O’Reilly offered his statement as proof that he never had falsely claimed that he was in the thick of the fighting. But you can suggest you were there without specifying that you were on the islands. The English language is plenty flexible enough to convey the same meaning using a different word, such as ""in."" O’Reilly’s statement is accurate but omits important context, so we rate this claim Half True. Correction: British forces sank an Argentine cruiser. An earlier version of this fact-check misidentified the type of vessel.",/factchecks/2015/mar/03/bill-oreilly/oreilly-i-never-said-i-was-falkland-islands/

$5,000 for couples, but half that for ""every American""
","
Candidates often try to place their proposals in the best possible light. But John McCain went a step too far in saying at a debate in Nashville on Oct. 7, 2008, that he wants to give ""every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit.""
 
It's actually half that: $2,500 for singles and $5,000 for couples.
 
The tax credit is part of McCain's health proposal, which seeks to increase competition for health care by reducing reliance on employer-provided health insurance.
 
Most Americans who have health insurance get it through their employer. Usually, the premiums are split so that the employer pays part and the employee pays part. Strictly speaking, the part that the employer pays is compensation, and workers would owe taxes on it if there wasn't a tax exemption in federal law. The exemption makes employer-provided health insurance more attractive to both workers and employers.
 
McCain's idea is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by tax incentives. So under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer-provided health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit to spend on any health insurance they wish. They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own.
 
Another caveat about McCain's tax credit: You can't get cash for it. To ensure that it goes to health care, the credit is payable directly to insurance companies. Any remainder would go into a special health spending account.
 
We've seen Barack Obama talk about a $1,000 tax cut for working families, when it's actually a $500 per person tax credit. McCain would be accurate if he had said $5,000 per family, but his statement in the debate takes things too far. It's $2,500 for single people. We rate his statement Half True.

Abortion survivor would have been protected under existing law
","
An ad from an independent advocacy group, BornAliveTruth.org, criticizes Barack Obama's votes on abortion when he was a state senator in Illinois.
 
The ad shows a young woman, Gianna Jessen, looking directly at the camera and saying the following: ""Can you imagine not giving babies their basic human rights, no matter how they entered our world? My name's Gianna Jessen, born 31 years ago after a failed abortion. But if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here. Four times Barack Obama voted to oppose a law to protect babies left to die after failed abortions. Senator Obama, please support born alive infant protections. I'm living proof these babies have a right to live.""

View the ad here

.
 
The ad refers to Illinois legislation put forward in 2001, 2002 and 2003 by opponents of abortion. The intent was to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is ""born alive"" and ""shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law.""
 
The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse, Jill Stanek, who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms. Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions.
 
Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care.
 
Obama did vote against the laws, by voting no or present on the bills. (In Illinois, a present vote has the same weight as a no vote.) But because of the older law, Jessen is wrong when she says ""if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here."" According to the medical records provided by the organization that produced the ad, Jessen was born at 29 weeks, which would have been a viable pregnancy and subject to the older Illinois law requiring that she receive medical care. So it's not correct to say that Obama opposed that.
 
Also, Jessen was born in California, not Illinois.
 
We know Jessen is speaking somewhat figuratively here, but the fact is that someone born under similar circumstances in Illinois would have been protected under the law. Obama has said he supported the existing law and felt it provided sufficient protection for abortion survivors like Jessen. We rule her statement False.

The Obama campaign has been trying to make inroads with voters who oppose abortion. Though Obama supports the right to abortion, he said he believes the number of abortions performed can and should be reduced. So the campaign released a vigorous response ad to the BornAliveTruth.org ad. But instead of targeting BornAliveTruth.org or Gianna Jessen,

the ad attacks McCain

.
 
""John McCain's attacks, the sleaziest ads ever. Truly vile. Now, votes taken out of context accusing Obama of letting infants die. It's a despicable lie. Even the bill's Republican sponsor said that it's untrue. Obama's always supported medical care to protect infants. McCain. He's running on a platform to ban abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. Sleazy ads. Anti-choice. That's John McCain.""
 
There are a few problems here. Obama's ad shows footage of the BornAliveTruth.org ad, which the McCain campaign did not produce. So the Obama ad is blaming McCain for an attack he didn't make. The first ad clearly states that BornAliveTruth.org created it, as is required by law.
 
Also, though the Republican Party platform does call for a ban on abortion, McCain himself favors exceptions for rape and incest. (His running mate Sarah Palin has said she opposes those exceptions, but the ad doesn't mention her.)
 
We looked for examples, but could find no cases of McCain accusing Obama of ""letting infants die."" Certainly some antiabortion activists who support McCain have made the charge, but that's quite different from the McCain campaign saying it. McCain's abortion-related attacks usually center on Obama's refusal to confirm conservative judges. We find the claim that McCain made the accusation to be False.

"['National', 'Economy', 'John McCain']","
The idea is old, but the plan is McCain's
","
In a debate that featured rehashed candidate positions, one new policy emerged: Sen. John McCain’s proposal to have the government buy and renegotiate what his top adviser later said would be “literally millions” of mortgages on houses whose values have dropped and whose owners are struggling to keep up with payments.
 
Taxpayers would cover the difference between the original loan and the new one, at a cost the McCain campaign estimated to be at $300-billion.
 
“Is it expensive? Yes,” McCain said during the debate on Oct. 7, 2008. “But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we’re never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And we’ve got to give some trust and confidence back to America.”
 
In announcing the plan amid the question-and-answer of a town hall meeting, McCain sought to make clear that this was a bold, new idea all his own: “And it’s my proposal, it’s not Sen. Obama’s proposal, it’s not President Bush’s proposal.”
 
The question is whether or not McCain's proposal is as original as he claims.
 
But first, some details on the plan.
 
“Mechanically, the initiative is very simple,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, senior policy adviser for the McCain campaign. “A home­owner would initiate the process by calling a mortgage broker or other originator and basically saying, 'I’d like to refinance my home,’ and they would start the underwriting process, verify incomes.”
 
The government loans would be available to mortgage holders who:
 
• Live in the home as a primary residence.
 
• Can prove their creditworthiness (and made a down payment at the time of the purchase).
 
The FHA would then issue a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at a rate Holtz-Eakin estimated would be “in the low 5 percent” range. Mortgage rates for 30-year fixed home loans are currently about 5.82 percent.
 
Taxpayers would pick up the difference between the value of the two loans.
 
While at least part of the expense of McCain’s plan would be borne by the recently approved $700-billion bailout plan, the initiative also would tap some of the $300-billion tied to the Housing and Economic Recovery Act passed this summer. That’s a plan that seeks to refinance loans for low- to moderate-income homeowners struggling to pay for homes they bought for more than they are now worth.


The McCain plan outlines a dramatic shift in emphasis for the $700-billion bailout plan. While the bailout contained provisions to allow the Treasury to purchase mortgages directly, the legislation primarily was intended as a means for the government to buy troubled assets from financial institutions that might otherwise fail and that could later be sold when the markets recover.
 
The hope, said Holtz-Eakin, is that McCain’s “bottom level up” plan will offset the need for some of that $700-billion.
 
When McCain announced the plan at the debate, Obama supporters were quick to note that Obama had in previous weeks recommended that the bailout plan include the option of buying individual mortgages. “We can’t simply bail out Wall Street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are facing foreclosure — or, for that matter, are seeing their home values decline,” Obama said.
 
McCain argued, during the debate and afterward, that his proposal is nothing like what Obama talked about. And after hearing details the next day, the Obama campaign agreed with McCain.
 
Obama has always supported plans to have the government buy loans at market prices (in other words, the loan companies would have to swallow some loss), said Obama campaign economic policy director Jason Furman. And homeowners would have to share some of the profits should the value of the home rise. But McCain's proposal wouldn't do either of those things. The government would refinance homes at their new, lower value and absorb the loss in propoerty values entirely.
 
Okay, so who's idea is it?
 
Charlie Black, a senior adviser to McCain, told the

New York Times

the mortgage renewal idea actually originated with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who borrowed it from a Depression-era New Deal agency, the Home Owner’s Loan Corp.
 
Clinton spoke about her plan before Congress on Sept. 18, 2008. ""A new government entity like the HOLC with a focus on attacking the source of the problem can serve the purpose of clearing a lot of those toxic mortgage securities from the market,"" Clinton said. ""We know there will not be any semblance of a normal or orderly marketplace until we have found a way to resolve these mortgage securities that are metastasizing in the bottom of our markets. By taking this paper out of the market and quarantining it in this new entity we will be able to give the market breathing room to recover. We will also be able to set the stage for an orderly sale of these securities and in turn allow some of them to recover and actually regain some of their value. Perhaps just as importantly, not only would our financial markets stabilize but so would our housing markets.""
 
Although Clinton did not offer specifics of her plan, she seemed to suggest that it would entail buying mortgages at discounted current market rates, and that taxpayers might ultimately turn a profit on them. 
 
That's not McCain's plan.
 
So here's where we stand: It's true that terms of the $700-billion bailout plan first initiated by President Bush contains authority for the Treasury to purchase mortgages directly. And it's true that Obama has called for a component of the buyout plan to include direct purchase of mortgages to alleviate homeowners struggling to make payments. Finally, it's true that Clinton sketched out a plan last spring that shared some of the goals and traits of McCain's proposal.
 
The method McCain proposes — buying mortgages at their original value and renegotiating at the current market value (with taxpayers picking up the difference) — is indeed new. But while McCain can rightly take credit for the details of his proposal, he is by no means alone with the idea of having the federal government buy mortgages directly. We rate his statement Mostly True.

Small businesses exempt from Obama's plan
","
At the second presidential debate in Nashville, John McCain attacked Barack Obama's health care plan.
 
Obama's plan calls for ""mandates and fines for small businesses,"" McCain said.
 
""If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you — will fine you. That's remarkable,"" McCain said.
 
But we find that when you dig into the nitty gritty of Obama's plan, that's not the case.
 
Obama's plan expands health care coverage for those who don't have it by a number of strategies, such as creating national pools for individuals to buy their own insurance. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. And it aims at reining in costs for everyone by streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care.
 
Obama's plan does not mandate coverage, except for children. Obama said often during the Democratic primary campaign that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes. If there's a mandate on anyone to purchase health care, the mandate would be on parents, not small businesses.
 
Obama's plan says that employers who don't offer their employees insurance will be required to contribute to the national pool. Obama's plan exempts small businesses from contributing to the pool. The plan does not define what's a small business and what's not.
 
McCain calls this a ""fine,"" but being required to contribute to a pool is not the same as paying a penalty for some wrongdoing.
 
So even by a generous definition, Obama does not fine ""small businesses."" Indeed, they are not even subject to the mandate. We rate McCain's claim False.

High earners get a break under McCain's plan
","
In a debate in Nashville on Oct. 7, 2008, Barack Obama and John McCain tussled over tax policy.
 
Obama, responding to a question about fiscal responsibility, said the federal debt needs to be reduced in a way that shares the burden fairly.
 
""Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.""
 
To come up with that number, the Obama campaign cites an average CEO salary of $12.8-million and a tax savings of 5.5 percent for the top earners during the year 2012 under a McCain administration. That comes to about $705,000.
 
The math is accurate, but the numbers require a small amount of explanation.
 
The $12.8-million comes from a

Forbes

magazine study of the average CEO compensation in 2007 for the 500 largest companies. Technically speaking, this would not be the Fortune 500, a listing compiled by

Fortune

magazine. An extremely minor point, but we note it to give

Forbes

its due for compiling the study.
 
The 5.5 percent tax savings comes from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which estimated tax impact for income brackets under the McCain plan. They created an analysis that draws on the candidates' campaign stump speeches, and found that according to those proposals, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would get a 5.5 percent decrease in their tax rates in 2012 under McCain's plan. That comes to $700,000.
 
But the center also did an analysis based on information from the candidates' economic advisers, and those policies are slightly more conservative than what the candidates say in their stump speeches. For example, the candidates will talk about a proposal as if it will begin immediately, when the advisers say it will actually be phased in. Using the more conservative analysis, CEOs would receive a tax rate decrease of 2.1 percent, or about $270,000. That's still a big number, but not quite as big as $700,000.
 
It's not surprising that candidates select the numbers most advantageous to their argument, but it's worth noting that there is a different way to look at this calculation that is also valid. Still, Obama is using credible numbers from independent sources to make his point. It does seem that high earners do better under John McCain's plan. We rate his statement Mostly True.

Obama sounded the alarm on subprimes
","
As the U.S. and world economic systems continue to falter, both Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama claim to have seen the crisis coming to some degree, and tried to head it off.
 
McCain has

cited his endorsement of legislation

in 2006 that would have reined in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac somewhat. And at the second presidential debate, Obama cited a letter he wrote to federal officials ""two years ago.""
 
""Understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system,"" Obama said during the Oct. 7, 2008 debate. ""Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a subprime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.
 
""I wrote to (Treasury) Secretary (Henry) Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman (Ben) Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.""
 
The last sentence appeared to refer to

this letter

that Obama sent to Paulson and Bernanke on March 22, 2007.
 
Obama's comments in the debate suggest the letter warned about the then-looming subprime lending crisis and its potential impact on the wider economy.
 
So let's check the text.
 
""There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures,"" he wrote. ""We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes.""
 
He went on to suggest the two officials convene a homeownership-preservation summit where banks, investors, regulators and consumers could forge a plan to stave off foreclosures.
 
""Rampant foreclosures are in nobody’s interest... There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy,"" he wrote.
 
So yes, Obama characterized the letter accurately. In it, he not only called for action to head off the unraveling of the subprime mortgage market, but also warned about its impact on the nation's economy. He sent the letter about 18 months ago, a time frame for which ""two years"" is a fair estimate. We find his claim to be True.

Obama's earmark number is correct
","
The presidential candidates argued about the economy and fiscal policy at a debate on Oct. 7, 2008, in Nashville.
 
Barack Obama criticized John McCain's talk of earmarks, saying that cutting earmarks would not significantly affect the federal deficit.
 
""Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget,"" Obama said.
 
Fiscal conservatives concerned about the national debt — which is now more than $9-trillion in total — often mention earmarks as something that needs fixing. But earmarks are only a small part of the problem.
 
According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $18-billion for the 2008 budget, or roughly 10 percent of the deficit for that year. Another report found that appropriations bills in fiscal year 2008 included $16.5 billion for earmarks. Those numbers are lower than previous years because earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year’s deficit of $318-billion.
 
The numbers show Obama gets his earmark number correct. We rate his statement True.

eBay's big, but not that big
","
Asked during the second presidential debate whom he would consider for treasury secretary, Sen. John McCain floated the name of former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman, then talked her up with an astounding statistic.
 
""I like Meg Whitman,"" McCain said during the Oct. 7, 2008, debate. ""She knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was the CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now — 1.3-million people in America make their living off eBay.""
 
That's way off. We hate to nitpick apparent misstatements, but this one's a doozy — 1.3-million is the number of people

worldwide

who make

some

money off eBay, according to a 2006 A.C. Nielsen study.
 
As of 2003, some 20,000 Americans made their living off eBay, company executive Jim Griffith told a Colorado newspaper at the time.
 
These days, the company only keeps track of eBay entrepreneurs worldwide, and doesn't distinguish between full time and part time online auctioneers, a representative told us.
 
But it's not conceivable that the number of Americans making a living off eBay has climbed to 1.3-million. In 2005, the latest year for which statistics are available, just 724,000 Americans made money selling on eBay, according to a Nielsen study. But that includes many who made just a few bucks – not a living.
 
We examined this issue

before

, when McCain said 50,000 Americans made their living off eBay. The company told us it didn't know where he got that number, but we gave him a Half True because we couldn't be certain he was wrong.
 
This time, his number is more than a million higher, and not even conceivably true. McCain bought himself a False.

94? Not even close
","
As the presidential campaign heads into its final weeks, John McCain’s camp increasingly is portraying Barack Obama as a classic liberal who has never met a tax hike that he can’t support.

 

McCain’s camp contends Obama’s addiction to taxes would further weaken the already staggering economy by placing new burdens on middle-class Americans and prompting U.S. corporations to shift more jobs overseas. This line of attack allows McCain and his proxies to point to the Arizona Republican’s lengthy record in Congress of opposing tax increases while supporting reduced federal spending.
 
During the second presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., McCain made the charge directly.
 
""Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That's his record.""
 
Ninety-four times? Not that we could find. The tally more accurately demonstrates how easy it is to distort a candidate’s record by characterizing in broad strokes complicated bills and resolutions that contain myriad policy proposals.

 

The 94-vote count first appeared in a June 9 Republican National Committee “tax backgrounder” that purported to document the tax increases Obama proposed or supported in the U.S. Senate and Illinois Legislature, when he served in the state Senate. The RNC didn’t respond to a request from PolitiFact to provide a breakdown of all 94 votes it says its research staff unearthed. It indicated the results were gleaned using the Library of Congress’ legislative search engine, Thomas (named for Thomas Jefferson and

found here

).

 

With the right query, it’s possible to get that result, but the GOP’s list is misleading for a number of reasons.

 

First, it counts votes on Democratic budget resolutions, which set nonbinding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation but don’t have the force of law. For example, the Republicans cite Obama’s votes in support of a fiscal 2009 budget resolution they say would raise taxes on individuals earning as little as $31,850. We’ve previously dealt with this claim and ruled it

False

. The document assumes that many of President Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will be allowed to expire at the end of 2010, or that their cost will be offset by new sources of revenues. Republicans point to this as evidence that Democrats want to raise taxes. But the documents don’t have line items on tax proposals. And even if they did, they would amount to little more than political statements, because the documents cannot change tax law. So voting in favor of the resolution isn’t akin to voting to raise taxes.

 

The budget resolutions do provide a perennial source of fodder for incendiary claims because while they’re largely symbolic, they prompt lengthy debates with numerous votes. Obama voted on 43 occasions with the majority of Democrats during various stages of debate on the 2009 budget resolution, including instances in which he helped defeat Republican proposals dealing with borrowing from the Social Security trust fund and erecting new procedural hurdles to any legislation that would raise income taxes.

 

The 94-vote list also takes liberties characterizing which votes actually are “for higher taxes.” McCain’s folks count Obama’s opposition to extending lower tax rates for dividends and capital gains (at least nine votes), and his votes against exemptions to the Alternative Minimum Tax for middle-class taxpayers (at least five votes). These proposals were hallmarks of Republican efforts to extend a variety of popular tax breaks that were expiring when the GOP controlled Congress. Many Democrats, including Obama, opposed them as fiscally irresponsible and primarily benefitting the rich.

 

But if voting against a tax cut is the same as voting for higher taxes, then it’s worth noting McCain’s rather well-documented record in this regard. In 2001, McCain antagonized conservatives when he voted against President Bush’s tax cuts, saying they needed to be paired up with equivalent cuts in spending. He voted against the 2003 round of cuts, too.

 

We give McCain credit for adding the phrase ""or against tax cuts"" to Obama’s list of alleged misdeeds, because unlike the RNC tax backgrounder, this captures the essence of at least 20 of his documented votes.
 
However, McCain and the RNC both fail to note that some of the other votes would not have resulted in a net tax increase, but instead redistributed the burden among different payers. The 94-vote tally, for example, cites Obama’s support of higher taxes on the oil and gas industries. But some of those Democratic tax plans that would have eliminated a tax break for domestic production or imposed a “windfall profits” tax on the biggest oil companies would have applied the proceeds to wind energy, cellulosic ethanol, geothermal power and other emerging energy sources that produce less pollution than traditional sources. They also would have created a new incentive for consumers to buy plug-in hybrid cars and extend tax breaks for energy-efficient homes and businesses.
 
The Obama campaign says the 94-vote figure is dishonest and misleading, and with a wink compiled its own list of McCain votes, using his camp’s methodology. The results: the Republican candidate voted for higher taxes 477 times since arriving in Congress in 1982, including 105 occasions since 2005. Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden invoked the 477 figure during the vice presidential debate when Gov. Sarah Palin made the very same 94-vote charge. Biden said, “It’s a bogus standard.”
 
We didn't track down all 477 votes the Democrats claimed, but we looked at a few and found that McCain, indeed, could be depicted as having voted to raise multiple taxes, just as Obama did, if one reads the fine print. For example, in May 2006, McCain voted for a massive fiscal 2006 tax and spending bill that, among other things, increased excise taxes on public charities and expanded the base of the tax on private foundation investment income. These revenue-raisers helped offset $70-billion in tax cuts, including reduced rates on capital gains and dividends and writeoffs for small businesses, according to a summary prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1997, McCain voted for a $100.4-billion, five-year tax cut package that, among other things, raised cigarette taxes 10 cents per pack in 2000 and 15 cents per pack in 2002.


In the record, there are many instances in which Obama supported actual tax increases. We found more than 20 examples, such as an August 2007 vote on legislation to expand the State Children’s Health Insurance Program that called for increasing the federal cigarette tax by 61 cents per pack, to $1. Obama also supported a plan enacted in June to pay for a new veterans’ education benefit by levying a new 0.5 percent surtax on individuals who make more than $500,000 or couples who make more than $1-million in adjusted gross income annually.
 
But 94 still is awfully far away. The McCain campaign could easily claim that Obama has ""repeatedly"" supported higher taxes according to his record in the Senate. But by using such a precise number, the McCain campaign's charge carries a greater level of authority and credibility, which it really doesn't deserve. It's not merely that their count is wrong, but that they're misleading with their attempt at unsupported precision. We say False.

Unused acres aren't necessarily being ignored
","
In the second presidential debate on Oct. 7, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama listed energy independence as one of the nation's biggest priorities, and touched briefly on the controversial issue of whether to open up new areas to offshore drilling.
 
""I believe in the need for increased oil production,"" Obama said. ""We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68-million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.""
 
Obama has been a consistent opponent to opening new areas to offshore drilling. But in early August, Obama softened that position when he said he was open to supporting the New Energy Reform Act of 2008, a bipartisan compromise bill that includes alternative energy incentives that Obama wants — such as $84-billion over 10 years on research and development of better batteries, fuels and energy-saving technologies and tax incentives for people who buy hybrid and alternative-fuel cars — but also would allow drilling for oil and natural gas as close as 50 miles from Florida’s west coast. 
 
As he did in the debate, Obama has often bolstered his case against moving too fast on drilling with the argument that before opening up new areas to drilling, oil companies should be required to drill the acreage they already have.
 
Obama is echoing a June report from the Democratic staff of the House Natural Resources Committee, which cited the fiscal 2007 statistics from the Interior Department's Minerals Revenue Management that classified 67,055,715 acres of oil and gas leases as ""non-producing.""
 
The line sounds good as a Democratic rebuttal to Republican demands that Democrats move to allow drilling in Alaska's protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore areas that also are currently off limits to the oil and gas companies. A Democratic House bill would bar new oil and gas leases to leaseholders who have not met benchmarks to ""ensure"" oil and gas production within five years on the leases they already hold.
 
But Obama's statement is misleading, inasmuch as it suggests that oil and gas companies have access to 68-million acres of oil and gas fields that they deliberately are not drilling. What Obama did not take into account is the long, complex process that companies must work through, both in federal red tape and in geologic exploration, before leased property becomes a producing oil or gas field. The government classifies that acreage as ""non-producing"" simply because the companies aren't taking oil and natural gas out of it now.
 
David Curtiss, director of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists' Geoscience and Energy Office in Washington, D.C., says it's wrong to assume that ""the only lease that is being actively worked is one that has a drill rig on it.""
 
The Interior Department issues leases for onshore territory for 10-year initial terms. The department issues offshore leases for five-, eight- or 10-year initial terms, depending on the depth of the water. Dave Smith, a spokesman for the department's Minerals Management Service, which handles offshore leases, says those initial terms are calculated according to how long the government thinks it will take oil and gas companies to find and start producing oil or gas.
 
For both onshore and offshore leases, the companies have to comply with government permitting requirements as they undertake a lengthy scientific exploration process that culminates in test drilling to determine whether there is enough oil or natural gas in a particular spot to warrant full-scale drilling. All the while, the companies are paying rent to the federal government for acreage that is classified as ""non-producing.""
 
It can take more than 10 years for a company to start producing oil or natural gas from a leased parcel, but as long as the company can demonstrate that it is making serious efforts to find some, the leases are extended. If the company cannot show that it's actively working the parcel, the lease is not renewed. Sometimes companies don't renew leases if their early work leads them to believe adequate reserves of oil or gas don't exist.
 
Obama's statement suggests that ""non-producing"" acreage where drilling is permitted is land that oil companies are ignoring. That is simply not true. Years of exploration and federal permitting must be completed before leased land yields oil or gas. As a result, we find Obama's claim to be False.

McCain proud to have parted ways with Bush
","
During the second presidential debate, Sen. John McCain drew a distinction with President Bush on the issue of global warming.
 
""We have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet,"" McCain said when environmental issues arose during the Oct. 7, 2008, debate. ""I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.""
 
He went on to say he traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, and introduced legislation on the subject of global warming.
 
But let's check the record – as we have

in the past

when McCain made similar claims on the campaign trail – and see if he was in fact at odds with Bush on global warming.
 
McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.
 
On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.
 
When he introduced the bill, McCain called it ""the first comprehensive piece of legislation"" in capping emissions.
 
""The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. ""It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.""
 
By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.
 
Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in ""educating the Senate"" about how government could respond to global warming.
 
""It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,"" Roy said.
 
He called McCain ""a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.""
 
And so we find McCain's statement to be True.

Obama and Ayers, Round II
","
We at PolitiFact wondered when the toaster would pop on the William Ayers -Sen. Barack Obama connection.
 
Back in the primary, Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain made some political hay of Obama’s relationship with Ayers, a onetime member of the Weather Underground, a leftist fringe of the 1960s antiwar movement that was responsible for bombings at several federal buildings in the early 1970s.
 
PolitiFact looked at the

claim

then and found from 1999 to 2001, Obama and Ayers served overlapping terms on the board of directors for the Woods Fund, a philanthropic organization in Chicago. We also noted that campaign finance reports show Ayers donated $200 to Obama’s state senate re-election campaign in 2001.
 
Since the general election began, the McCain campaign had largely kept the issue on the shelf. But with the economy sagging and McCain’s numbers dipping in the polls, an Oct. 3, 2008, a story in the

New York Times

that added some new details to the association between the two provided the McCain campaign just enough kindling to revisit Obama’s long-ago association with the controversial figure.
 
And now, Gov. Sarah Palin is running with it.
 
""Well, I was reading my copy of

The New York Times

the other day, and I was really interested to read about Barack’s friends from Chicago,"" Palin said at a rally in Clearwater, Fla., on Oct. 6.
 
""Turns out, one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers. And according to

The New York Times

, he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that, quote, ‘launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.’ Wow.
 
""And there’s even more to the story,"" Palin said. ""Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that’s less than truthful. His own top advisor said they were, quote, ‘certainly friendly.’ In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’s home. And they’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago.""
 
First, a little background on Ayers. He was, in fact, a founding member of a group known as the Weathermen, who were responsible for bombings of the New York City police headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971 and of the Pentagon in 1972 in protest of the Vietnam War.
 
Ayers and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, also a Weather Underground member, spent years as fugitives in the 1970s, but federal riot and bombing conspiracy charges were dropped in 1974 because of illegal wiretaps and other prosecutorial misconduct.
 
Since then, Ayers has rehabilitated his image with many in the Chicago community, including Mayor Richard M. Daley. Ayers is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago and has developed a reputation as an advocate for school reform. Which is, according to Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, how the two met.
 
The recent

New York Times

story added to the understanding of Obama's association with Ayers, through an education project. Ayers helped Chicago win nearly $50 million for Chicago schools as part of a national school reform project, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge.
 
In March 1995, Obama was named chair of the six-member Chicago Annenberg Challenge board that distributed the grants. A

New York Times

review of archives of the Chicago Annenberg project found that the two attended six board meetings together.
 
Later that year, the Ayers’ hosted a coffee at which Illinois State Sen. Alice Palmer, who planned to run for Congress, introduced Obama to some of her long-time supporters as her chosen successor. According to the

New York Times

story, it was one of several neighborhood events held that year on Obama’s behalf, and it was not the first. Obama campaign officials also note the event at Ayers’ home was not a fundraiser. And they claim that Obama did not know Ayers’ history with the Weather Underground at that time. They did not say when Obama found that out.
 
Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt told PolitiFact the two have not communicated by phone or e-mail since Obama became a U.S. senator in 2005, and that they last spoke to one another about a year ago, when they bumped into each other in the neighborhood - they live just a few blocks apart.
 
""The suggestion that Ayers was a political adviser to Obama or someone who shaped his political views is patently false,"" LaBolt said. ""As the

New York Times

confirmed, the two were not close.""
 
Asked about his relationship at a Democratic debate on April 16, 2008, Obama said, ""This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who’s a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from. He’s not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis.
 
""And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old, somehow reflects on me and my values doesn’t make much sense.""
 
For what it’s worth, the story Palin cited in her comments, the Oct. 3, 2008,

New York Times

piece, concluded after a review of Chicago Annenberg archives and interviews with a dozen people who know both men, that Obama ""has played down his contacts with Mr. Ayers...But the two men do not appear to have been close. Nor has Mr. Obama ever expressed sympathy for the radical views and actions of Mr. Ayers.""
 
In previous speeches the day before her appearance in Clearwater, Palin accused Obama of ""palling around with terrorists."" We think that statement goes too far, and is just false, as there is no evidence that Obama has had any relationship with Ayers as a U.S. senator.
 
But let’s review what Palin said in Clearwater, and weigh it against the facts as we know them. Palin called Ayers one of Obama’s ""earliest supporters"" and said Obama ""held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’ home."" Obama campaign officials acknowledge Ayers hosted a coffee in 1995, the purpose of which was to introduce Obama to some local political players leading up to his first run for public office. Obama campaign officials say Obama didn’t know Ayers’ past at that time, and McCain campaign officials wonder why this week was the first time that has ever been mentioned. Make of that what you will, but that part of Palin’s statement is true.
 
Palin said Ayers was a ""domestic terrorist."" The Weather Undergound group was labeled a ""domestic terrorist group"" by the FBI, and Ayers was a founding member of the group, but charges against him were dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct.
 
Palin said Obama claimed Ayers was ""just someone in the neighborhood,"" but her remark ignored Obama's condemnation of Ayers in that very sentence she quotes. Obama did seem to downplay his relationship with Ayers, stating that he was ""a guy who lives in my neighborhood,"" but Obama in that same answer acknowledged that he knew Ayers and called his actions 40 years ago ""detestable"" and said they do not reflect his own values.
 
Lastly, Palin said Obama and Ayers have ""worked together on various projects in Chicago."" They were both involved with the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. And they both served for a time as directors of the Woods Fund. Neither chose the other to work with either group.
 
Voters can decide for themselves how much stock to put in all that. And they may disagree with the implications that are inherent in Palin mentioning such connections.
 
Palin generally has her facts right here, but she ignores an important element -- Obama's condemnation of Ayers' history -- and implies a closer relationship than the record supports. We find her claim Mostly True.

Obama revives an 80s scandal
","
Days after Sen. John McCain's campaign started attacking Sen. Barack Obama's past association with the 1970s radical William Ayers, Obama's campaign countered with a 13-minute Web video on McCain's history with convicted banker Charles Keating, Jr.
 
The documentary burrows deep into the details of McCain's role in the Keating Five, a quintet of senators investigated for pressuring regulators on Keating's behalf prior to his notoriety as a villain in the late 1980's savings-and-loan crisis.
 
This sentence, from a blurb introducing the video on a

Web site

set up by the Obama campaign on Oct. 6, 2008, best encapsulates their attack:
 
""McCain intervened on behalf of Charles Keating with federal regulators tasked with preventing banking fraud, and championed legislation to delay regulation of the savings and loan industry – actions that allowed Keating to continue his fraud at an incredible cost to taxpayers.""
 
Let's check the evidence.
 
Keating and McCain, both former Navy fliers, met at a Navy League dinner in 1981, and became friends and mutual supporters.
 
Keating, a prominent Arizona banker, organized fundraisers for McCain's campaigns for the House and later the Senate, and donated $112,000 to McCain by 1987. He also hosted the McCain family at least nine times at his lavish vacation home in Cat Cay, Bahamas.
 
""I genuinely liked him and enjoyed being around him, especially on those occasions when Cindy and I and our oldest child, Meghan, were invited to his family's vacation home in the Bahamas,"" McCain wrote in his 2002 book

Worth the Fighting For: A Memoir

.
 
Keating complained frequently to McCain about regulations – and regulators – that he said threatened the success of the Lincoln Savings and Loan, a subsidiary of Keating's American Continental Corp.
 
McCain was persuaded to act. On two occasions in 1987, he and fellow Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of Ohio and – in the second meeting – Don Riegle of Michigan, (all Democrats aside from McCain), met with federal regulators at Keating's request and asked them to back off Lincoln.
 
During the second meeting, the regulators told the senators they suspected Lincoln of criminal misconduct, and intended to refer the matter to the Department of Justice. That took the senators aback – McCain, in particular, did nothing more on the matter after the regulators mentioned criminality, a Senate investigation later found.
 
The regulators went on to recommend a criminal investigation of Lincoln, but little came of the recommendation until the government seized the failing institution in 1989. Different players in the drama have different interpretations of whether the senators' involvement delayed the investigation.
 
But it is clear that indeed McCain ""intervened on behalf of Charles Keating with federal regulators tasked with preventing banking fraud,"" as the Obama campaign claimed.
 
In fact, McCain had intervened on Keating's behalf before.
 
Having ""heard frequently from Charlie"" about a proposed savings-and-loan regulation called the ""direct investment rule,"" Mcain tried to fight the regulation or get an exemption for Lincoln, he wrote in his book.
 
""I sent or cosigned as many as five letters to (Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chair) Ed Gray and White House officials, and in January 1985, I cosponsored a House resolution calling for the promulgation of the regulation to be postponed,"" McCain wrote. ""All such efforts came to naught, however. The rule was promulgated on schedule, and Lincoln's application for an exemption was rejected.""
 
So yes, McCain also ""championed legislation to delay regulation of the savings and loan industry,"" the second component of the Obama campaign's claim.
 
But here we have a quibble with the Obama campaign. It's hard to see how McCain's championing of the legislation ""allowed Keating to continue his fraud,"" since the legislation failed.
 
The Obama campaign did not respond to our requests to defend its claim.
 
It's also important to note that the Senate Ethics Committee, after a 14-month investigation into the Keating Five, largely exonerated McCain, citing him only for ""poor judgment.""
 
""The Committee concludes that Senator McCain exercised poor judgment in intervening with the regulators,"" the committee said in a statement at the conclusion of its investigation in 1991. ""Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate.""'
 
Nevertheless, revelations about his relationship to Keating tarred McCain. He did not reimburse Keating for $13,433 worth of airfare to Keating's home in the Bahamas until the trips were exposed years later by reporters in Arizona. And reporters also discovered that McCain's wife and her father had invested $359,100 in a shopping center with Keating in 1986.
 
Keating was convicted in 1993 of 73 counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud, and served 50 months before the conviction was overturned because the jury had been told of his conviction in state court. In 1999 he pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and was sentenced to time served.
 
The government seizure of Lincoln cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, a sum that many would find ""incredible,"" as the Obama campaign claimed.
 
So it's clear that McCain did ""intervene on behalf of Charles Keating with federal regulators"" – language lifted almost directly from the Senate committee report. And McCain also ""championed legislation to delay regulation of the savings and loan industry"" – as he acknowledged in his own book. It's debatable whether the first of those actions ""allowed Keating to continue his fraud,"" and the second certainly didn't, since the legislation didn't pass. But yes, Keating's fraud did exact a huge cost from taxpayers. We find this claim Mostly True.

McCain opposed 2007 war funding bill
","
UPDATED: We updated this item on Oct. 6 and changed the ruling to True. See explanation at end.
 
During an exchange with Sarah Palin in the St. Louis vice presidential debate on Oct. 2, 2008, Joe Biden tried to rebut a charge that Barack Obama had failed to ""fund the troops"" in Iraq by saying John McCain had done the same thing on a different bill.
 
Palin began the exchange by saying that ""Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so. And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that. You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that. He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops.""
 
Biden replied that Obama had offered a withdrawal plan that would shift responsibility to the Iraqis over the next 16 months and would draw down U.S. combat troops. As for the allegation about failing to fund the troops, Biden said, ""John McCain voted the exact same way. John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops. And John said I'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there's a timeline.""
 
Republicans candidates have charged that Obama ""failed to fund the troops"" because of his May 24, 2007, vote against

an appropriations bill

that included funding for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. (It passed, 80-14.)
 
We addressed that charge in

this item

and found it was misleading to say Obama did not want to fund the troops. We noted that Obama's primary reason was that the bill lacked a timetable for withdrawal. “We must fund our troops,"" he said at the time. ""But we owe them something more. We owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war. ... We must negotiate a better plan that funds our troops, signals to the Iraqis that it is time for them to act and that begins to bring our brave servicemen and women home safely and responsibly.”
 
Biden's rebuttal in the vice presidential debate seems to be a reference to a war spending bill that first passed the Senate in March 2007. When Biden refers to an ""amendment,"" we believe he was referring to the provision that would require a withdrawal of troops. And Biden is correct that McCain voted against the bill when it included that requirement.
 
The bill,

H.R. 1591

, included $97 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and set a goal to withdraw most U.S. troops in Iraq by 2008. It passed 51-47 but was opposed by most Republicans because of its timetable for withdrawal. 
 
McCain said he opposed the bill because it had been loaded with political pork and because it required a withdrawal regardless of conditions in Iraq.
 
""Such a mandate would have grave consequences for the future of Iraq, the stability of the Middle East and the security of Americans at home and abroad.  For these reasons, I do not support this bill,"" McCain said at the time. (The bill passed but was vetoed by President Bush.)
 
Biden is right that McCain opposed a war spending bill. We find Biden's statement True.
 
UPDATE: We originally rated Biden's statement Half True because, although McCain had issued a statement opposing the bill, he missed the vote on the bill on April 26, 2007. But after a reader called our attention to this vote, which occurred one month earlier, we changed our ruling to True.

Health care ad is right -- until the end
","
A new ad from Barack Obama attacks John McCain's health care plan.
 
""John McCain talks about a $5,000 tax credit for health care,"" an announcer says. ""But here’s what he’s not telling you. McCain would make you pay income tax on your health insurance benefits. Taxing health benefits for the first time ever. And that tax credit? McCain’s own Web site said it goes straight to the insurance companies, not to you, leaving you on your own to pay McCain’s health insurance tax. Taxing health care instead of fixing it. We can’t afford John McCain.""
 
The ad has a good bit of truth in it, but the notion that it leaves you ""on your own"" to pay a new tax on insurance is deceptive.
 
Let's back up a minute, though, to explain a few features of current health care policy and how McCain's proposal would change it.
 
Most Americans who have health insurance — about 71 percent — get it through their employer. Usually, the premiums are split so that the employer pays part and the employee pays part. Strictly speaking, the part that the employer pays is considered compensation and workers would owe taxes on it if there wasn't a tax exemption in federal law. The exemption makes employer-provided health insurance more attractive to both workers and employers.
 
McCain wants to improve the health care system by encouraging greater competition for health insurance. His idea is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by tax incentives. So under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer provided health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit of $2,500 per person ($5,000 for couples) to spend on any health insurance they wish. They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own.
 
At times, the McCain campaign has touted the credit without mentioning the proposed repeal of the tax exemption on employer-provided insurance. (For an example, see the exchange on health care insurance between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden during

the vice presidential debate

on Oct. 3, 2008.)
 
The ad reminds viewers — fairly, in our view — about the end of the tax exemption, an important part of the overall McCain plan. But then the ad says, ""McCain’s own Web site said it goes straight to the insurance companies, not to you, leaving you on your own to pay McCain’s health insurance tax.""
 
McCain's Web site does say that, but there's an excellent reason that the credit goes to the insurance companies. It's so people don't blow the tax credit on cigarettes and beer (or whatever else they'd like) instead of health insurance. Under McCain's plan, workers would pay taxes on the health exemption, but they would get $2,500 knocked off their health insurance bill. If workers come out ahead and there's money left over, that would go into a health spending account for them to spend on health-related incidentals.
 
It's a complex switcheroo, but there's ample evidence to show that the plan would be a wash for most workers. The McCain campaign says only workers with ""gold-plated"" health programs would do worse. An independent analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute confirms that: ""In general, lower-income people with health insurance would receive benefits from the credit that would be well in excess of the value that they receive from today’s tax exemption. The gains are much smaller for higher-income people.""
 
So the Obama ad gets its particulars correct, but ends with an unfair assertion. McCain's health plan does not leave you ""on your own to pay McCain’s health insurance tax."" We rate Obama's statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Sarah Palin']","
Property taxes rates went down, sales tax up
","
In the vice presidential debate on Oct. 2, 2008, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin reached back to her tenure as mayor of a small Alaska town to make a point that she has some history as a tax cutter.
 
""I’m going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also,"" Palin said. ""As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes. I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax. We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up.""
 
We’re going to focus here on the claims Palin makes about her record as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, from 1996 to 2002.
 
During that time, Wasilla’s property tax rate did inch down year after year, from 2 mills to 0.5 mills.
 
But did taxes actually go down? That depends on how you define taxes. The overall amount of taxes collected increased by 25 percent under Palin. According to a review of Wasilla's financial reports, the amount of revenue taken in during 1996 was $6,070,806 and rose to $8,710,166 in 2002. That’s a 43 percent increase (25 percent when adjusted for inflation).
 
So how is it possible to lower the property tax rate but take in more in taxes? The simple answer is sales tax. The sales tax is overwhelmingly the chief source of revenue in Wasilla. In 2002, the sales tax brought in nearly $6-million, compared to $343,000 from property taxes. And according to a city analysis, the amount of money brought in by the sales tax increased each year, by a total of about 50 percent between 1997 and 2002.
 
That's a testament to economic growth in Wasilla, said current Mayor Diane M. Keller. In fact, under Keller, property taxes were later eliminated.
 
The increased sales tax revenues allowed Palin to cut the property tax rate each year at the same time spending increased. The operating budget for Wasilla went from $6,050,160 in fiscal year 1996 to $9,393,768 in 2002, according to figures provided by the city. That’s a 55 percent increase (35 percent when adjusted for inflation).
 
While the property tax rate decreased on Palin's watch, the sales tax rate increased from 2 percent to 2.5 percent. The increase was approved by voter referendum to pay for construction of a multiuse sports complex. Due to the economic growth in the community, Keller said, Wasilla is going to be able to stop charging that extra 0.5 percent sales tax two years earlier than anticipated.
 
Under Palin’s mayorship, the city also took on an additional $23.7-million in long-term debt to finance the sports complex as well as for street and water projects.
 
 
 
According to Keller, much of the additional spending under Palin was due to the growth of the city during those six years, both economically and in increased population.
 
Palin is right when she says personal property tax and business inventory taxes were eliminated. But those cuts were mostly offset by an increase in a vehicle tax enacted by Matanuska-Susitna Borough — the equivalent of a county in many states — where Wasilla is located. A portion of the vehicle tax is distributed to Wasilla. According to a Dec. 24, 1997, article in the

Anchorage Daily News

, the elimination of Wasilla's personal property tax and business inventory taxes amounted to a revenue loss of about $93,000 a year. The borough's vehicle tax increase brought Wasilla an additional $70,000 a year.
 
Palin can rightly claim that the property tax rate decreased when she was mayor. But she fails to note that while property tax rates went down, sales tax revenues went up. Some may not consider that a tax increase. But in addition to more revenue from increased economic activity, the sales tax rate also was increased. That increase was tied to funding a new sports complex, and was passed by referendum, but it’s still an additional tax. And so we find Palin's statement Half True.
