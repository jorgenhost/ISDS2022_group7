Bill Nelson says Connie Mack IV has been “a promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage”
","
The primary isn’t over yet, but Bill Nelson expects his general election rival for U.S. Senate will be Connie Mack IV, and he’s launched his first statewide ad attacking his rival.

Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, released the ad against Mack, a Republican congressman from Fort Myers, on Aug. 2. It seeks to paint Mack as a brawling incompetent.

Narrator: ""Florida, meet Connie Mack IV. A promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage. A big spender with a trail of debts, liens and unpaid bills. He has one of the worst attendance records in Congress this year but he still voted to end Medicare as we know it. Questionable work habits. A sense of entitlement. Connie Mack, he thinks the rules are different for him.""

That echoes some online attacks by Mack’s Republican primary opponent George LeMieux, who dropped out of the race in June because of Mack’s overwhelming lead in the polls and fundraising.

LeMieux claimed that Mack’s only ""real job in the real world"" was an events coordinator for Hooters. We ruled that Mostly False because Mack had some additional private sector jobs including selling fitness equipment. PolitiFact Florida also recently checked a claim by another Mack Republican rival, former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, that Mack missed ""almost half"" his votes in Congress this year. We rated that Mostly False. Though Mack had missed votes, he had not missed that many.

In this report, we will briefly review Mack’s Hooters-related job and whether he had a ""history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage.""

Mack’s work for Hooters

Mack campaign spokesman David James told us for our previous fact check about Hooters that Mack was a marketing executive for LTP Management from 1994 to 2000. The company owned and operated several Hooters franchises in Florida, as well as Dan Marino's Town Tavern and Lulu's Bait Shack.

Mack never received a paycheck directly from Hooters, but ""we never denied he worked on behalf of Hooters,"" James said.

Hooters has often been mentioned in articles throughout Mack’s political career, which started with a state House seat he won in 2000. He won his first congressional race in 2004.

A 2000 Palm Beach Post article quipped: ""When he announced his candidacy in November, he mentioned his ‘broad business experience’ - surely an unintentional pun."" The Tampa Bay Times The Buzz blog recently posted Mack’s Hooters business card.

Nelson’s ad cited a 2012 POLITICO blog headline: ""Connie Mack’s Hooters connection."" The blog stated that Mack, his political action committee and his wife U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack, R-Calif., received nearly $50,000 in donations from Hooters management during their time in office.

Our one criticism about this part of the ad is that Nelson didn’t make it clear that Mack’s Hooters-related work ended more than a decade ago. Calling Mack ""a promoter for Hooters"" leaves the impression that Mack currently works for Hooters. That isn’t accurate -- he stopped working for LTP management in 2000.

 ""A history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage""

Now let’s turn to the portion of the ad where the narrator said that Mack had ""a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage."" On the screen the word ""arrest"" also appears.

The ad cites a March 2012 Associated Press article describing past incidents that occurred in the 1980s and early 1990s when Mack was in his 20s. The Miami Herald also wrote about Mack’s past in February 2012. We will pull from both newspaper articles plus court documents the Miami Herald posted online to summarize these incidents.

1989 nightclub arrest: While at a Jacksonville nightclub called Bananas, Mack, then 22, was arrested by an off-duty Duval County sheriff’s deputy. After Mack or one of his friends was asked to remove his hat (reports conflict on this point), Mack refused and swore at club workers, according to employee testimony. Mack refused to leave and was arrested for resisting an officer without violence. 
Mack called the arrest a misunderstanding and pleaded no contest. The judge withheld adjudication, meaning he has no criminal record, according to the Herald. The report was sealed by court order. As we'll see, Mack was later involved in litigation that brought the incident to light.

1992 bar brawl: In February 1992, Mack got into a brawl with then-professional baseball player Ron Gant at an Atlanta bar called Calico Jack’s. The Miami Herald reported: ""A waitress testified that Mack, who had been heavily drinking beer and Jagermeister shots all night, took the first swing at Gant. Mack testified he couldn’t remember how much beer he drank, but said he had only one liquor shot — of tequila. Gant claims a drunken Mack repeatedly bumped into him, precipitating a fight. Mack claims Gant attacked him for no reason. During the melee, Gant head-locked Mack. Mack testified that he couldn’t breath. So he starting striking and grabbing the ball player’s crotch. At a certain point, the club’s bouncers got involved and Mack broke his ankle. He sued Gant, who was held liable. But a jury awarded no damages."" (Here is a court document in which Mack describes that incident at length.)

Late 1980s road rage incidents: The road rage incidents came to light in a 1996 deposition involving the Gant case. Here is how Mack described them: In one incident, which Mack placed around 1987 or 1988, Mack and a girlfriend were driving to Cape Coral when he said a man tried to run them off the road after he thought that Mack’s girlfriend had cut in front of him. She drove off the road into a ditch, and Mack and the other man got out. ""He attempted a swing at me, and I swung back and hit him..."" Mack testified. Mack said he then headed back to his car and the other man, wielding a bat, chased him, tried to hit him and then smashed the windows of Mack’s car.

In the other incident, which Mack placed around 1987, occurred in West Palm Beach when he was in a car with friends and stopped at a draw bridge. The guys in Mack’s car had just watched a Howie Mandel video, and one of the guys in the car was ""in the back screaming like Howie Mandel."" A man in another car apparently got upset. Mack got out of his car, and the other man got out of his car and jumped on top of Mack.

Mack said he later received a phone call from a police sergeant who said someone wanted to press charges but that he never heard anything about it again.

We don’t have a full account of the road rage incidents -- the Associated Press wrote that court records in the Gant civil suit didn’t include testimony from the other people involved. And there were conflicting accounts in the Jacksonville and Atlanta brawls. For example, in the Gant fight a waitress said Mack bought about 20 pitchers of beer and rounds of shots over five hours and was drunk, while Mack said he felt no effect from two to four beers and one shot over two hours, according to the Associated Press.

Mack’s response

For this article we asked James, Mack’s campaign spokesman, if he had anything he wanted us to review. James told us in an email that ""all of this is very important as PolitiFact found all of this stuff false or mostly false in the spring when LeMieux did it.""

A Mack spokesman previously told the Miami Herald as for Mack’s past brawls that Mack was ""young and foolish"" at that time.

Our ruling

Nelson told TV viewers across the state: ""Florida, meet Connie Mack IV. A promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage."" The word ""arrest"" appeared during the ad.

Much of that statement is true, but there are some key omissions:

• Nelson failed to make it clear that Mack stopped working as a promoter for Hooters 12 years ago.

• Nelson omitted the timeline on the criminal history and road rage: Those incidents occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mack was in 20s at the time. He’s now about to turn 45.

• We have an incomplete picture of the road rage incidents, making it difficult to discern how much Mack was to blame.

But Mack did work as a promoter for Hooters and has a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Mitt Romney would add “trillions” to the deficit while Barack Obama would “cut the deficit by $4 trillion,"" says Obama TV ad
","
Editor’s note: After we published this item, we were alerted that our description of the position of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget contained incomplete information. We reviewed that description, interviewed the committee’s staff again, made changes, and re-published our report on Sept. 19, 2012. The text of our original report is archived here. The ruling remains Half True.

President Barack Obama would like to cast Mitt Romney as a retread of the George W. Bush years. His campaign’s latest ad lists some prominent features of the Bush presidency and has Romney’s plans matching them item for item. Here’s what the ad says:
   
""You watched and worried. Two wars. Tax cuts for millionaires. Debt piled up. Mitt Romney's plan? A new $250,000 tax cut for millionaires. Increase military spending. Adding trillions to the deficit. Or President Obama's plan. A balanced approach. 4 trillion in deficit reduction. Millionaires pay a little more.""
   
In this fact check, we’ll look at the statement about the deficit. Would Romney’s plan add trillions while Obama’s cut the deficit by $4 trillion? Both candidates have put forward proposals, and independent analysts have tallied the impacts over the next 10 years. While predictions that far out are never guaranteed, they do provide some useful comparisons.
   
Romney’s plan
   
Romney has outlined specific tax cuts on his campaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax.
         
Romney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent.
   
To offset those cuts, Romney has suggested that he would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes.
   
There are many tax breaks for individuals and businesses. Which ones will be reduced or eliminated? Romney doesn’t say.
   
For individuals, two of the biggest are the home mortgage deduction and the tax-free treatment of health insurance benefits. For companies, industries from oil and gas to agriculture enjoy tax deductions and exemptions. Romney’s goal is to spur growth by giving people fewer opportunities and incentives to game the system. He promises that broadening the tax base will not be a back door tax hike.
   
""Washington’s problem is not too little revenue,"" Romney says. ""But rather, too much spending.""
   
On the expenditure side, Romney says he will bring federal spending below 20 percent of GDP by the end of his first term. Defense is not on the chopping block -- he would ""reverse"" the cuts proposed by President Obama -- but everything else is.
   
Romney endorses capping non-security discretionary spending below 2008 levels. He would cap Medicaid, turn it into a block grant to the states and limit increases to 1 percent a year.

We should note that Romney has been highly complimentary of the House Republican budget plan, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Romney says the plan moves in the direction he wants to go on spending.

But the plans are not identical. For example, Romney favors more defense spending. And on taxes, Ryan would reduce the number of tax brackets to two, while Romney would keep the usual six.

In Romney’s most detailed spending plan, he said he will ""pursue further entitlement reform."" He makes no specific proposals on Social Security or Medicare but says there are many options to keep both systems solvent. Romney says he will reduce the federal workforce by 10 percent and consolidate agencies.

Romney’s lack of detail on both the tax and spending sides raises uncertainty among independent budget analysts. The Tax Policy Center, a collaboration of the Urban Institute and Brookings, said it was impossible to precisely gauge the impact on total tax revenues because Romney doesn’t say how he would expand the tax base. With no change in the tax base, the center estimated that by 2015, tax collections would be about $900 billion less than you would expect under current law.

""That would be fine with me,"" said Chris Edwards, head of the libertarian Cato Institute’s project on downsizing the government. ""But Romney should match it with equal proposed spending cuts, which I don’t think he’s done. He might give a percentage of GDP target for spending, but I think candidates should be specific.""

The Obama campaign cited an article by Josh Barro, now lead writer for the Bloomberg Ticker, as one of the sources of their claim that Romney’s plan would add trillions to the deficit. Barro estimates the 10-year cost of all of Romney’s tax cuts would be $5 trillion. But Barro himself says Romney is too vague for anyone to draw the definitive conclusion made in the Obama ad.

""There’s a strong case to be made that it would add to the deficit,"" Barro told us. ""But I would take it more as an opinion than a factual statement.""
   
Still, Barro is skeptical that Romney’s plan would hold up. ""It is politically unlikely that you would be able to come up with enough spending cuts and base broadening to achieve $5 trillion in revenue reductions,"" he said.

Finally, there is the assessment from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction. They estimate that Romney’s plan will increase the deficit by a total of $2.6 trillion by 2021. Jeff Vanke, senior policy analyst at the committee, says the Romney campaign consistently declines to describe how they will broaden the tax base and compensate for lower tax rates.
   
""We’ve asked them several times if they can specify any offsetting reduction,"" Vanke said. ""They have said each time that we’ll have to wait.""
   
Vanke’s tally of the missing numbers from theRomney plan looks like this: 
Looking at a 10-year period through 2022, Vanke says Romney has not explained $5.7 trillion in tax changes and spending cuts.
   
Obama’s plan
   
The president’s plan for deficit reduction relies on a blend of tax reductions for some, tax hikes for others and spending cuts. On the tax side, he would allow the Bush tax cuts to expire for single people making over $200,000 and couples making over $250,000. Those higher-income earners would also see a drop in the tax benefit of their itemized deductions.The estate tax would go back up to 2009 levels. Big banks would pay as much as $61 billion more. He would eliminate tax breaks for oil and gas companies.
   
Obama would extend the payroll tax cuts for employers with deeper reductions for firms with 20 workers or less. The corporate tax rate would fall from 35 percent to 28 percent. Like Romney, he would broaden the tax base by eliminating tax breaks.
   
In contrast to Romney, Obama has an extensive list of tax breaks he would eliminate. They can be arcane. For example: 
On the spending side, Obama proposes $580 billion in cuts to a number of programs that range from agricultural subsidies to rental assistance to airport construction. In 2011, Obama proposed some $320 billion in health program cuts. Washington would pay less to drug makers and nursing homes. In the long run, many states would shoulder a larger share of Medicaid costs.
   
The Obama plan includes many hikes in user fees and related payments. Federal workers would pay more into their retirement fund. Higher income Medicare beneficiaries would pay more for Part B premiums and drug coverage. Air travelers would see a rise in the security fee added to a ticket. Gold and silver mining companies would pay higher royalties.
   
Changing baselines
   
The Obama campaign claims that over 10 years, it would trim deficits by $4 trillion. Many assumptions lie behind that statement but the most important question is, compared to what?
   
No budget projection makes sense unless it’s measured against some baseline. A baseline is an analyst’s best guess as to what the deficit would be if things were left to themselves. Changes in tax law, government spending and economic growth are just some of the major factors that drive baseline estimates.
   
The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, looked at the president’s 2013 budget and concluded that it would increase the cumulative deficit by $3.5 trillion over its baseline between now and 2022. That greatly undercuts Obama’s argument that he is saving money.
   
But the CBO baseline assumed that all of the Bush tax cuts and other tax breaks would expire. It assumed that Congress would stick to all the spending caps in the deficit reduction law it passed to avoid a government default. Many, if not most, analysts doubt that the CBO baseline is realistic.
   
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has its own baseline. Unlike the CBO, it assumes that Congress will find a way around the deepest budget cuts and that it will extend the tax cuts to some degree. Where the CBO predicts that the total debt held by the public will stand at about 76 percent of GDP by 2022, the committee thinks the number will be more like 86 percent.

It’s important to keep this in mind: A baseline that predicts a higher deficit, either in terms of dollars or as a percentage of the GDP, makes it easier for a deficit reduction plan to look good. The worse the problem is expected to be, the bigger the gains from a solution.
   
By the way, the CBO does craft an alternative baseline. Under that one, the total debt would be about 93 percent of GDP in 2022.
   
Using the baseline developed by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the president’s budget plan looks much better. Jason Peuquet, the committee’s research director, says it delivers about $2.4 trillion in new savings. Another group, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, estimates the number at $2.2 trillion.

In order to get to $4 trillion, you need to add the savings that stem from spending cuts in 2011, both from the budget deal and earlier in the year. Obama includes those in his tally but they did not originate with his budget proposal.

Peuquet warns that all numbers like these ""can be gamed."". His group thinks the more important goal is to get deficits headed down relative to the size of the economy. On those terms, he says the president’s plan is a good start but does not go far enough.
  
Our ruling
   
The Obama campaign ad said Romney would increase the deficit by trillions while Obama would cut the deficit by $4 trillion. Obama's deficit reduction plan is much more specific than Romney's, but for a sitting president, that's expected.
   
Still, independent analysts say that Romney's plan is so vague that it's difficult to know how his plan will impact the federal budget. What are missing are the politically sensitive details on which programs he would cut and which tax breaks he would reduce. What we do know indicates his plan could drive up deficits, potentially a great deal.
   
The Obama plan offers enough details to estimate its impact with more accuracy. Independent analysts estimate savings of about $2.4 trillion over ten years due solely to his proposal.  Obama’s plan on its own does not produce the full $4 trillion. Plus, estimates over 10 years are always uncertain and some analysts caution that achieving the $4 trillion goal by itself does less to solve the deficit problem than the president suggests.

"['Georgia', 'State Budget', 'Transportation', 'Stacey Abrams']","
Does Georgia have a pothole in transportation spending?

","
The morning after the Atlanta area overwhelmingly said no to a 1 percent sales tax to fund more than 150 transportation projects across the region, one prominent leader said that her fellow state lawmakers now needed to take the lead on the issue.

""Georgia has under-invested in our transportation network for years, and we rank near the bottom in per capita transportation spending,"" House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat, said in a press release.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the state representative was correct. Or do we need to put a ""stop"" sign in front of Abrams before she repeats this claim again?

As we began our research, PolitiFact Georgia found several officials making similar claims, including the state’s Transportation Department.

""Georgia is the 6th fastest growing state in the nation, yet 49th in per capita spending on transportation,"" said a May 16 press release from the state agency about bridge replacements over Lake Lanier.

A spokeswoman for the state’s House Democratic Caucus, which sent out Abrams’ press release, initially forwarded us a link to the Atlanta Regional Commission’s top 10 facts about the recent transportation referendum. The ARC, which works on growth and development issues for the 10-county metro area, said that Georgia was 48th in per capita spending on transportation. The ARC report did not have any charts or graphics showing how Georgia compares to other states.

The caucus later sent us a report by the fiscally conservative Georgia Public Policy Foundation that said Georgia ranks 49th in per capita transportation spending. The report did not have a chart showing Georgia in comparison to the other states.

We decided to do the math for ourselves as well.

As part of our research, we noticed that several groups used data compiled by the Federal Highway Administration to calculate how much money each state spends on transportation. One chart we saw on its website had revenues used for highways. The most recent year was 2010. PolitiFact Georgia calculated the totals for each state and excluded federal funds since we are examining a claim about state spending on transportation. We then divided the total for each state by the number of its residents. Only two states had lower per capita highway spending, South Carolina and Tennessee. Georgia spent about $298 per person on highways.

How did that compare to other reports on per capita highway spending that we reviewed? Georgia ranked similarly low.

The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center found in 2009 that Georgia ranked ahead of just Rhode Island and South Carolina in per capita highway spending. The Tax Policy Center, a partnership between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, examines federal and state tax policies and those of this year’s presidential candidates.

Another report we found that examined transportation spending in Pennsylvania, based on data compiled in 2010, ranked Georgia 50th in per capita highway spending, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Federal Highway Administration. The report on Pennsylvania shows Georgia has more miles of highway than 40 states. Most of the states with more miles of highway also ranked low in per capita highway spending.

The National Conference of State Legislatures ranked Georgia second to last in per capita revenue on highways in a report it released in 2006. The report examined highway spending from 1999 to 2004. Georgia spent about $220 per person annually, the report found. Only California was lower. Delaware was first, spending more than $900 per person, according to the research.

The NCSL report also included data on spending for public transportation. Georgia ranked 38th of the 45 states that had data that could be examined. Georgia spent 55 cents per person in 2004, according to a chart in the report. Massachusetts was first, spending approximately $376 per person. Northeastern states dominated the top of the rankings and had more sources of transportation funding. We did not see any other reports on public transportation spending by state.

The charts we reviewed and our own research all showed the same thing: Georgia was among the five lowest states in terms of per capita spending on highways. The most recent NCSL report on public transportation showed a similar conclusion. Therefore, we rate the statement by Abrams as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970157C0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/07/stacey-abrams/does-georgia-have-pothole-transportation-spending/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says U.S. was on path to balanced budget when he left the Senate
","
Republican George Allen says the federal budget was in decent shape when he left the U.S. Senate in January 2007.

""When I left the Senate, we were on a trajectory towards a balanced budget,"" Allen said during a July 22 debate in Hot Springs with Democrat Tim Kaine, his opponent for the U.S. Senate.

Kaine has repeatedly criticized Allen for casting votes during his term in the Senate that helped turn a budget surplus Allen inherited into deficits. We were curious whether Allen’s response -- that the nation was on a course towards a balanced budget at the end of his term -- is correct.

When Allen came into the Senate in January 2001, the government was running its fourth straight fiscal year of surpluses, taking in $121 billion more than it was spending and paying down the federal debt, then valued at $3.3 trillion.

In fiscal 2002, the U.S. began its current streak of running deficits. The economy slowed that year, and a number of measures that Allen backed during his term contributed to the red ink: two foreign conflicts, tax cuts and the expansion of Medicare to cover prescription costs.

The deficit swelled to $413 billion in fiscal 2004 and contracted to $161 billion in fiscal 2007, when Allen left the Senate after an election defeat.  

The Allen campaign, in a website post, cited the steadily declining deficits from 2004 to 2007 as proof of Allen’s statement that the U.S. was heading towards a balanced budget at the end of his term.

The campaign also cites budget projections released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in January 2007, shortly after Allen left office. The CBO predicted that deficits would gradually diminish and the budget essentially would be balanced in 2011 and produce a surplus in 2012 and afterwards.

But there’s an important caveat that the Allen campaign glosses over. CBO projections are made with an assumption that policies currently in effect will not change. And when the CBO released the report cited by Allen, major tax cuts approved under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 were scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. The Bush tax cuts have since been reset to end at the end of this year.

Allen, in his unsuccessful 2006 campaign against Democrat Jim Webb, repeatedly called for the Bush tax cuts to be extended permanently, a position he has strongly maintained in this year’s race against Kaine.

In other words, Allen’s proof that the U.S. was on a trajectory towards a balanced budget when he left the Senate relies on ending the Bush tax cuts -- an action that he has long opposed.

We wondered what would have happened if Allen had gotten his way and the tax cuts were permanently extended during his term. Would the U.S. have still been on a path towards a balanced budget when Allen left the Senate? Let’s examine this through the lens of January 2007, the final month of Allen’s term.

Back then, the nation was in its fourth month of a fiscal year that would produce a $161 billion deficit. The CBO was projecting improvement to a $170 billion surplus for 2012. But pivotal to the nation returning to black ink was $332.2 billion in added revenues from the expiration of the Bush tax cuts.

If the tax cuts had been made permanent, the U.S. would have been heading towards a $162.2 billion deficit in 2012. The red ink would have grown to a $242.7 billion in 2016, according to CBO figures, before falling slightly to $210.7 billion in 2017. So in terms of raw dollars, the deficit would have been expected to slowly increase during the 10 years after Allen’s departure if the Bush tax cuts had been made permanent.

Many economists say the best way to compare deficits through history is to measure them against the Gross Domestic Product -- the market value of all goods and services produced by a nation. The comparison to GDP provides a gauge of a country’s ability to absorb its deficit.

In fiscal 2007, the U.S. deficit that was 1.2 percent of its GDP.  A computation of figures in the CBO report issued that January show that if the Bush tax cuts had been made permanent, the deficit would have dropped to 0.9 percent of GDP this year, risen to 1.2 percent next year and leveled at 1.1 percent in 2014 and 2015, risen to 1.2 percent in 2016 and dropped to 1 percent in 2017.

So if the Bush cuts had become permanent before Allen left the Senate, little long-term change would have been expected in size of the deficit compared to the GDP.

Of course, many of the numbers bandied about in 2007 seem now rosy in the light of the $1.3 trillion U.S. budget deficit expected this year. Hindsight is perfect, and back in 2007 the CBO couldn’t predict collapses in the housing and financial markets that led to the Great Recession. 
Our ruling 
Allen, trying to refute charges he voted to run up federal deficits, said the U.S. was ""on a trajectory towards a balanced budget"" when he left the Senate in 2007.

Allen’s campaign cites a 2007 CBO report that said Washington was on the road to budget surpluses, starting in 2012. But those projections were based on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would end as scheduled in 2010. And Allen has maintained since at least 2006 that the tax reductions should be made permanent.

Had Allen prevailed on the tax cuts, figures in the 2007 CBO report point to the deficit slowly rising in raw dollars over the next eight years. The deficit, as a percentage of GDP, would have been only a smidgen lower in 2015 than it was in 2007.

So Allen is right that the U.S. was projected to be on a trajectory towards a balanced budget when his Senate term ended. But he omits a key detail that creates a different impression: the projected path towards a balanced budget required a step Allen refused to take -- ending the Bush tax cuts.

"['Rhode Island', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Poverty', 'Retirement', 'Chain email']","
Blue Cross logo gives new fuel to bogus e-mail claiming huge after-election premium increase for Medicare recipients.
","
If you're a Medicare recipient, are you facing a massive increase in your monthly premium if you pay for Part B coverage?

That’s what a chain e-mail that’s making the rounds says. We received a copy and we heard a caller cite it recently on WPRO’s ""The Buddy Cianci Show,"" so we decided to check it out.

The e-mail claims the increase was ""purposely delayed so as not to confuse the 2012 Re-Election Campaigns."" It says the $104.20 monthly fee for 2012 will be ""$120.20 per month in 2013 and $247.00 per month in 2014."" That's more than double in one year.

Some other versions blame Obamacare for the sharp increase.

""You probably haven't heard about it in the Mainstream News,"" the e-mail says.

Well, there's a reason for that.

The claim is as bogus as a $3 bill.

Fact-checkers everywhere have debunked it, including PolitiFact National and our friends at FactCheck.org and Snopes.com.

But the version that's making the rounds has a new twist: it comes from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama.

More about that in a moment.

First, we should update some numbers.

The e-mail says the ""current"" monthly fee is $96.40. That was actually the premium in 2009. It gives a 2012 rate as $104.20; it's actually $99.90.

The premium for 2013 will be set in the fall. But according to Page 229 of the 2012 report from the board of trustees on Medicare, the estimated standard monthly premium will be about $109.10 a month, not $120.20. In 2014 it will be about $3 more, not $127 more as the e-mail claims.

After that, the report projects, annual increases through 2021 will likely range from 4.3 to 6.1 percent.

It should be noted that higher-income seniors are charged more, a provision that was in place years before Obamacare was passed.

Now back to Blue Cross.

We suspect that the e-mail is getting additional credence because it carries the logo of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama and contact information for a worker there.

When we called Alabama, Koko Mackin, a Blue Cross vice president, said the worker had simply received the e-mail and forwarded it without assessing whether it was true.

""This e-mail was not created or approved for distribution by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama and is not reflective of the Company's position. It contains incorrect information received by an employee who redistributed it to six others,"" she said in a statement.

Our ruling

A chain e-mail says Medicare insurance premiums will be rising to ""$120.20 per month in 2013 and $247.00 per month in 2014.""

The claim has been repeatedly debunked and although the truth can easily be found with a quick Google search, it continues to spread.

Even newer estimates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services show that the increases projected through 2021 will bring the premium to $161.20 -- not even close to the $247 premium that the e-mail says will take effect in 2014.

So if you're feeling hot and bothered after reading and passing along this bit of e-mail twaddle, it's not because seniors will be facing a 105 percent premium increase from 2013 to 2014.

It's because you've got Pants on Fire!

Mitt Romney says a lawsuit filed by President Obama's campaign challenges voting privileges for the military
","
After some Ohio voters faced hours-long lines at polling places during the 2004 presidential election, the state adopted reforms designed to prevent similar problems in the future. Those reforms included allowing voters to cast ballots at county boards of elections for an extended period before elections. In 2008, Barack Obama’s presidential campaign used those new laws to its advantage. The campaign made particular use of voting the Sunday before elections in Ohio and other states as African-American churches organized ""Souls to the Polls"" events that took congregants to vote after religious services.

Republicans who control Ohio’s state government passed a law last year that would have reduced the time frame for early voting from five weeks to three, eliminated most weekend voting hours and dropped a requirement that poll workers redirect voters to the correct precinct if they show up at the wrong one in a location that hosts multiple precincts. Ohio legislators repealed that law when it became clear it would face a referendum this year, though its ban on early voting on the weekend before elections remained in place because it was part of a separate law.  Democrats including U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown say Republicans wanted to eliminate that weekend’s early voting to cut turnout among African-Americans who vote after church, a demographic likely to vote for Obama. Brown said that in 2008, up to 19 percent of Ohio voters cast their ballots during the weekend before the election.

Last month, President Obama’s re-election campaign filed a lawsuit against Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted  to demand that in-person voting be allowed during the three-day weekend before elections. It noted that approximately 93,000 Ohioans voted in the three days before the 2008 presidential election. The lawsuit argues that all Ohio voters should be permitted to cast ballots that weekend, as members of the U.S. military are permitted to do. The complaint alleged that Ohio’s legislature failed to justify the disparate treatment between military and nonmilitary voters, and contended the ""unequal burden on the fundamental right to vote violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.""

That assertion by the Obama campaign riled more than a dozen military groups - including AmVets and the Military Officers Association of America. On Aug. 1, they filed a motion to intervene in the Obama campaign’s lawsuit. It said they want to ""defend the fundamental constitutional right to vote of members of the U.S. Armed Forces, which includes the right to receive special accommodations, flexibility and extra time to facilitate their voting, whether absentee or in-person.""  Their legal filing said the means the Obama campaign was using to request an overall extension of Ohio’s early voting period - ""a ruling that it is arbitrary and unconstitutional to grant extra time for early voting solely to military voters and overseas citizens - is both legally inappropriate and squarely contrary to the legal interests and constitutional rights"" of members of the U.S. Armed Forces.

On the same day as the military groups filed their briefs, attorneys for the state of Ohio filed their own response to the Obama campaign’s complaint. It said that special laws were enacted to help uniformed and overseas citizens cast absentee ballots because they are often not present in the areas where they vote, and that the state of Ohio doesn’t have to treat other voters the way it treats those uniformed and overseas citizens.

""From the beginning of our Republic, military voters have had special problems in obtaining ballots and casting them,"" the state of Ohio’s legal filing says. ""Ohio’s laws, allowing UOCAVA (Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voter Act) voters the ability to cast an absentee ballot after the time during which non-military and domestic voters may do so has closed, rationally recognizes the unique circumstances that military voters may face.""

The state of Ohio filed a brief that backed intervention by the military groups. So did the Obama campaign.

""Plaintiffs seek to restore for all voters access to early voting through the Monday before Election Day,"" the Obama campaign’s brief said. ""Neither the substance of its Equal Protection claim, nor the relief requested, challenges the legislature’s authority to make appropriate accommodation, including early voting during the period in question, for military voters, their spouses or dependents. The question before the Court is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the State of Ohio may arbitrarily and without justification withdraw from all other Ohio eligible voters the same right they previously had to vote the weekend and Monday before election day.""

It didn’t take long for these dry legal exchanges to erupt into a political bonfire. Toward the end of last week, websites began to make the misleading claim that the Obama campaign was suing the state of Ohio to restrict military voting, when the lawsuit actually sought to permit all Ohio voters to vote the weekend before elections, as military voters can do. On Saturday, GOP Presidential candidate Mitt Romney issued a statement that accused Obama of trying to undermine the rights of military voters.

""President Obama’s lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state’s early voting period is an outrage,"" Romney’s statement said.

In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Obama campaign advisor David Axelrod disputed the way that Romney and others were characterizing the lawsuit.

""What that lawsuit calls for is not to deprive the military of the right to vote on the final weekend ,"" Axelrod told host Chris Wallace. ""Of course, they should have that right. That suit is about whether the rest of Ohio should have the same right. And I think it’s shameful that Governor Romney would hide behind our servicemen and women to try and win a lawsuit to deprive other Ohioans. . . of the right to vote.""

Democrats lined up their own military members to protest how some were describing the lawsuit.

Former Democratic congressman John Boccieri of Alliance,  a Lt. Col. in the U.S. Air Force Reserves,  issued a statement that accused Republicans of distortion.

""This is about restoring equal and fair access to early voting and in no way asks for restrictions to voting,"" Boccieri said. ""Anything said otherwise is completely false. Period. And as a member of the American Legion and a lifetime member of the AMVETS, I find these claims outrageous.""

Indeed, Obama’s lawsuit clearly states that it seeks to permit all Ohioans - not just members of the U.S. military -  to vote during the three days before the election, as was the case in 2008. The suit in no way suggests restricting early voting by members of the military.

It is simply dishonest for Romney and his backers to claim that Obama’s effort to extend early voting privileges to everyone in Ohio constitutes an attack on military voters’ ability to cast ballots on the weekend before elections.

"['Oregon', 'Infrastructure', 'Transportation', 'TriMet']","
Would we need to add 2.9 lanes to the Sunset Highway if not for Westside MAX?
","
TriMet recently ran ads in some editions of The Oregonian claiming that ""without Westside MAX, we’d need to add 2.9 lanes to the Sunset Highway."" 

For those drivers lucky enough not to experience the hell that is a Sunset Highway commute, know that TriMet is talking about the portion of U.S. 26 that carries vehicles between downtown Portland and Washington County. The lanes are jammed during commute hours, and we’re pretty sure some drivers would love to add an extra 2.9 lanes anyway to relieve congestion.

Light-rail trains parallel some of the highway, but not all of it. Our question was simple: We wanted to know how TriMet, the metro area’s public transit agency, calculated the need to add 2.9 lanes of highway if not for westside MAX.

TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch got back to us with a calculation prepared by staff; the explanation clarified that the figure should be 2.7 lanes. (This is not the first time a query by PolitiFact Oregon has prompted a revised figure. There’s just something about us that makes people correct themselves.)

Here’s the calculation:

Basically, TriMet checked how many times a light-rail train went through the Washington Park station (westbound) and through the Sunset Transit Center station (eastbound) between 4:30 and 5:30 in the evening in Spring 2011. The total was 20 trips, or trains.

Each two-car train can carry a maximum, or full load of, 266 people, according to TriMet. If you multiply 266 by 20 trains, that’s a maximum 5,320 people on light-rail that pass through those points in that one-hour period. Compare that to the 2,052 people estimated in one highway lane over the hour. (That’s using a standard 1,800 vehicles per hour multiplied by an occupancy rate of 1.14 people per auto during a commute. )

So the maximum number of people on MAX over that hour is equivalent to the number of people on 2.6 lanes. Hence 2.6 added lanes. Again, that was in spring 2011. TriMet added another train this spring, bringing the total number of trains to 21, which translates into the revised figure of 2.7 added lanes and a maximum capacity of 5,586 riders.

Next, we turned to John Charles of the Cascade Policy Institute, who is the libertarian think tank’s leading critic of light-rail transit.

He contested TriMet’s claim on several fronts, including the theory that the analysis doesn’t account for people who could have been carried by bus if TriMet hadn’t reduced bus service for light-rail. But the most interesting suggestion he made was that maximum capacity doesn’t matter; actual ridership matters.

We asked Fetsch for the number of riders on those trains.

Weekday ridership for the 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. peak hour in spring 2012 averaged 1,673 westbound and 938 eastbound for a total of 2,611 riders. That’s not close to the maximum capacity of 5,586 riders and, using TriMet’s own calculations, comes to 1.3 added lanes.

Fetsch said TriMet’s intent was not to suggest that they would need to build 2.7 lanes to the highway corridor, which probably isn’t possible anyway unless you demolish some hills. ""Our intent was to describe the mobility capacity of MAX in terms that people could relate to who travel within that corridor,"" she wrote in an email.

But that’s not what the ad says. It clearly states we would ""need to add"" lanes. That indicates that without westside MAX, we’d need that many more lanes to maintain the traffic flow we have now.

TriMet may have the capacity to carry the equivalent of 2.7 lanes, but that’s not what the ad said.

There’s an element of truth in the statement. TriMet can show a method by which it translates carrying capacity into highway lanes. TriMet may have the capacity to carry the equivalent of 2.7 lanes, but its trains weren’t carrying anywhere near that many people at the time of the estimate. And with that, we wish commuters good luck and rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097465D00>],/factchecks/2012/aug/06/trimet/would-we-need-add-29-lanes-sunset-highway-if-not-w/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Alan Grayson']","
Alan Grayson says Jeb Bush rejected ""Quiñones Plan"" as taxation without representation
","
Let’s say you’re a Florida Republican seeking public office. If there’s one nickname you don’t want, it’s ""Tax Man.""

And if there’s one man you don’t want dissing your ideas, it’s former Gov. Jeb Bush.

Alan Grayson, the former Democratic U.S. House member from Orlando, is trying to stick both of these toxic GOP labels on former state Rep. John Quiñones. Grayson is unopposed for the 9th congressional district, but Quiñones, R-Kissimmee, must pass the Aug. 14 primary.

""John Quiñones: The Tax Man,"" claims a mailer from Grayson’s campaign.

The mailer says Quiñones voted to raise various taxes as a Tallahassee lawmaker and as a current member of the Osceola County Commission.

The kicker: ""Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed the Quiñones Plan because it was ‘taxation without representation on a large scale.’ ""

Grayson cites a June 28, 2006, story by the Tampa Bay Times as backup for the Bush claim. We cracked open the archives and found references to rental cars but nothing about Quiñones or the ""Quiñones Plan.""

We wondered what Grayson was talking about.

The plan in question was a wide-ranging transportation bill, SB 1350, that would have raised money for city and county transportation projects by adding a $2-a-day tax on rental car customers, if voters approved it in a county referendum.

Central Florida Republicans had backed the idea for years, including former state Sen. Daniel Webster, who ousted Grayson from his U.S. House seat in 2010. They argued the surcharge wasn’t really a tax because it would be up to county voters, and the state needed money to pay for urgent transit needs. 
An Orlando Sentinel editorial praised the surcharge as ""the Holy Grail of Central Florida lawmakers for nearly a decade."" The charge would have targeted tourists, who come to Orlando for theme parks and clog the highways. 
If approved by voters in Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties, the proposal would have generated $40 million for local transportation needs, or $80 million coupled with matching funds, according to the newspaper. 
SB 1350 passed the House by a vote of 103-14 and the Senate by 34-4. Quinones -- along with now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and most House conservatives -- voted yes.

Rental car companies and Americans for Tax Reform, the anti-tax group of Grover Norquist, attacked the plan as unfair to tourists. In the end, Bush agreed.

He threw down a veto a few days before the law was to take effect. In his veto message, Bush praised legislators for trying to solve rising transportation costs and make transportation project contracts more competitive. But he drew the line at the optional increase on rental car taxes, and Grayson accurately quotes part of his explanation:

""While I appreciate the inclusion of voter approval as a prerequisite to implementing the new tax, these taxes will be paid disparately by tourists visiting Florida, consequently creating taxation without representation on a large scale. Philosophically, I cannot support this.""

So where does Quiñones come in? Even though his name isn’t on the final legislation, he played a role in the rental car surcharge issue. He introduced the House companion to Webster’s Senate bilion Oct. 31, 2005. Quiñones’ bill, HB 301, exempted motorists who rented cars while their automobiles received repairs.

His bill was never brought up for a full floor vote on its own, but the idea was amended to the final version of SB 1350. 
Quiñones defended the idea in committee. 
""In this situation, you have an opportunity to allow tourism to help on the transportation problem that we have in our community,"" he said, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. ""This way it would have less impact on the local residents. I didn’t want to have an added burden on the local constituencies."" 
The Orlando Sentinel editorial credited Webster and now-state Sen. Andy Gardiner for guiding the measure through session, ""with the help of Rep. John Quiñones."" 
Our ruling 
Grayson says Bush vetoed the ""Quiñones Plan"" because it was ""taxation without representation on a large scale."" His mailer accurately quotes Bush’s veto message but lacks context about what the vetoed ""Quiñones Plan"" entailed.

There’s no denying Quiñones played a hand in legislation that would have allowed county residents to vote on an additional $2 per day surcharge on rental cars, which would mostly have hit tourists. He sponsored language that ended up in the final bill.

But the mailer has no details for voters, unless residents somehow connect it with the words ""rental cars"" in a cluster of items Grayson says Quiñones taxed. It’s unfair to say Quiñones taxed rental cars when the ""plan"" in question would be up to county voters and it never happened because of Bush’s veto.

Plus, even though Quiñones sponsored a version of the surcharge legislation, his clout trails the influence of two Central Florida colleagues widely credited for getting the language in the final version of SB 1350 -- which was certainly not known as the ""Quiñones Plan"" around the Capitol.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Taxes', 'Harry Reid']","
Harry Reid says anonymous source told him Mitt Romney didn't pay taxes for 10 years
","
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney’s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn’t paid any taxes for 10 years. 
In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, ""His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,"" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. 
Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, ""Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years."" 
Reid continued, ""He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,"" said Reid. ""But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? … You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars."" 
On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, ""As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not."" 
And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, ""I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years."" 
Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. 
""Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,"" Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, ""Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign."" 
Other Republicans leaped to Romney’s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN’s State of the Union that ""I think he’s lying"") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a ""dirty liar"" on ABC’s This Week. 
Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times’ Frank Bruni called Reid’s charges part of an ""unbecoming, corrosive game."" ""Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,"" Bruni wrote. ""Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That’s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late."" 
Many readers asked us to put Reid’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. 
An anonymous source? 
On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. 
Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn’t pay taxes for 10 years. 
In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. 
But Romney’s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he’s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. 
To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it’s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it’s safe to assume it’s well below 7.5 percent. 
Neither study directly addresses Romney’s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it’s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. 
Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, ""probably not."" 
The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it’s ""highly unlikely"" that he paid nothing. 
""It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn’t taxed until sold and may never be sold,"" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, ""But Romney’s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It’s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said."" 
Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it’s theoretically possible, it’s also ""preposterous."" 
""Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,"" the article said. ""But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney."" 
We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. ""I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,"" White said. 
Our ruling 
Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that ""the word is out"" when in fact it was only Reid who put that ""word"" out. 
Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. 
Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up. Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028096711F00>],/factchecks/2012/aug/06/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-anonymous-source-told-him-mitt-rom/

Group says Connie Mack has passed only one bill in Congress in seven years
","
Woody Allen once said 80 percent of success is showing up.

And that’s the point American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC, makes in a farcical online video that criticizes U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV for a shabby attendance record, and for not getting much done.  

""Connie Mack: Only one bill passed in seven years,"" says the video, which features a bummed out Florida family (presumably actors) unable to find Mack in Washington. ""You think we’ll see him next time, pa?"" says a disappointed child.

""Connie Mack: If he doesn’t show up for work now, why elect him senator?"" the video continues.

Mack’s missed votes have made news for several months as he prepares for a likely November face-off with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. PolitiFact found that although he’s not the most representative representative (sorry!), his attendance record is better than opponents have claimed.

But did Mack really pass just one bill since he was elected in 2005?

Here comes the fact-check.

Mack sponsored only one bill -- during the 110th Congress in 2007-08 -- that was signed into law, according to the Library of Congress.

The measure corrected a faulty map of Florida’s Coastal Barrier Resources System, which protects coastal landforms that conserve wildlife.

The bill was passed ""under suspension,"" which means it was so noncontroversial Congress didn’t put it through committee for vetting. Most of the other 46 bills Mack sponsored died in committee.

""In this case, he didn’t have to jump through the normal hoops,"" said Norm Ornstein, a congressional expert and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""That may be very nice for Florida, but it’s certainly not major policy.""

Yet, the numbers game often isn’t a fair assessment of legislators’ efficacy, Ornstein said. Some of history’s best lawmakers rarely saw their names attached to legislation.

""It’s not just the number, it’s the quality. You could pass a whole bunch of bills that would be renaming post offices, commemorative resolutions, etcetera,"" Ornstein said.

That’s one reason why accusations about attendance and effectiveness, which surface often in elections, are usually ripe for rebuttal.

In fact, the video itself is a parody of one put together by former Gov. Charlie Crist when he ran for governor in 2006 against then-U.S. Rep. Jim Davis.

""This ad used the same standard the Crist campaign used for the Davis ad,"" said American Bridge spokesman Matt Thornton. ""There was some discussion in the media, but the consensus was that the ad was a fair.""

The American Bridge video doesn’t mention that Mack co-sponsored 700 bills since 2005, about 50 of which passed.  But co-sponsorship is not a good measure of efficacy, Thornton said, because bills often have hundreds of sponsors who sign on for purely political reasons.

""Anyone can co-sponsor anything,"" he added.

Case in point: Mack was one of 308 cosponsors for a measure by Jacksonville Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown that awarded the congressional gold medal to the Montford Point Marines, a nonprofit veterans group.

Brown’s office said that, while Mack was kind enough to sign on to the measure, he didn’t help move it through Congress.

Still, it’s possible Mack was instrumental in some of the bills he cosponsored. And he also might have passed some of his proposals by tacking them on to other bills as amendments.

Both scenarios are difficult to track, and Mack campaign spokesman David James gave vague responses to questions intended to pin down the congressman’s specific accomplishments.

Mack’s record only proves that he focuses on repealing bad bills rather than passing new ones, James said.

""Connie has run successfully four times for the Congress representing Southwest Florida on the platform of reducing government, not growing it,"" James wrote in an email.

Also, he said, Mack has a plan to balance the budget -- known as the Penny Plan -- that has attracted support in Congress.

Our ruling

American Bridge is right to say Mack only passed one bill in seven years. However, they leave out that Mack cosponsored about 50 bills that were written into law and didn’t consider that some of his bills may have passed as amendments.

Also, it's important to note that the number of Mack bills that became law is only one measure of his overall record -- and one that can be misleading when viewed in isolation.

GOP congressman Chuck Fleischmann claims Obama was saying “small businesses succeed because of government”
","
Republicans have been pounding President Barack Obama relentlessly ever since he made remarks about the intersection of business and government during a campaign appearance in Roanoke, Va., on July 13, 2012.

Critics pointed to two lines in the speech to make the case that Obama holds a general disdain for people who create and build businesses.

U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, who represents Tennessee’s 3rd Congressional District, offered his own critique of the president’s remarks a few days after Obama set off the firestorm.

""Obama: Small Businesses Succeed Because of Government,"" screamed the headline from a blog entry that Fleischmann posted on his campaign website on July 17, 2012.

""Having no experience in running a business, President Obama just doesn’t get it,"" Fleischmann wrote. ""In fact, he fights against it. Just recently, he said: ‘If you’ve got a business – you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.’ ""

""If you are like me,"" Fleischmann continued, ""you were speechless at the President’s latest arrogant attack on the foundation of the American economy. The President insists on pushing his view of successful businesses in America – that we owe the government for our success.""

Asked to explain Fleischmann’s comments, his campaign spokesman, Jordan Powell, said the blog item was built around Obama’s remarks in Roanoke.

""The president seems to think that the government is the engine of success, and Chuck thinks it’s not so – it’s the private sector and hard-working small business owners,"" Powell said.

Obama’s Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has made pretty much the same claim about the president at public events and in several ads. The Republican National Committee and the National Federation of Independent Businesses are among the groups that have released their own videos and statements claiming Obama is out of touch.

The criticism has become so big a threat that Obama’s re-election campaign felt the need to address the issue in a web video titled ""Tampered"" that quoted media accounts saying the quote had been taken out of context.

We won’t delve into the broader question of what President Obama thinks about businesses. Here, we will simply examine Fleischmann’s claim that, in his campaign speech, Obama was saying ""small businesses succeed because of government.""

Our colleagues at PolitiFact national have examined similar claims made by Romney and others and given them False rulings. Many of their points are repeated here.

Let’s begin by looking at the full context of Obama’s speech. Here’s what he said:

""There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me -- because they want to give something back. They know they didn’t -- look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.

""If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business -- you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.

""The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.

""So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the G.I. Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that’s the reason I’m running for President -- because I still believe in that idea. You’re not on your own, we’re in this together.""

When placed in context, it is obvious Obama was making the point that success comes from the combination of ""individual initiative"" and the fact that ""we do things together.""

Fleischmann and others who have criticized Obama’s remarks omitted the lead-up to his statement -- that ""if you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges.""

These words indicate Obama was referring to infrastructure and educational opportunities that were paid for by taxpayers through the government -- things that the President argues establishes a necessary foundation for making private businesses successful.

We think his meaning is clear -- that both business people and government play a role in the American enterprise system, not purely one or the other.

Our ruling

 Rep. Fleischmann cherry-picks a quote from President Obama’s remarks to make it appear Obama was being dismissive of businesses and was saying in essence that
""small businesses succeed because of government.""  But the preceding sentences in Obama’s remarks make clear that he was talking about the importance of government-provided infrastructure and education to the success of private businesses.

Fleischmann also ignores Obama's clear summary of his message, that ""the point is ... that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.""

By leaving out the ""individual initiative"" reference, Fleischmann has given a false impression. We rate his statement False.

In Wisconsin Senate race, Republican Jeff Fitzgerald say Dem U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin has passed only 3 bills
","
In the race for a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat, Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin consistently portrays herself as a fighter for the middle class.

And the four Republicans seeking to win the Aug. 14, 2012, primary to challenge her frequently remind voters that Baldwin is one of the most liberal members of the House. (In September 2011, we rated as Mostly True a claim that she is the most liberal.)

With a July 26, 2012 news release, GOP candidate Jeff Fitzgerald took a different tack on Baldwin's record.

""Without her extreme liberal voting record, you wouldn’t even know she has been in Washington for the last 14 years,"" the Wisconsin Assembly speaker said, adding:

""In her nearly decade and (a) half in Congress, Tammy Baldwin has sponsored 105 bills. Only three have been enacted into law.""

The implication: Baldwin is ineffective.

Fitzgerald's evidence

Baldwin, who is unchallenged in the Democratic primary, entered Congress in January 1999. She is serving her seventh two-year term.

Fitzgerald’s news release provided a term-by-term count of the 105 bills he said Baldwin sponsored, plus a summary of the three it said became law. (Baldwin’s campaign agrees with the numbers.)

Baldwin’s House Resolution 1760, introduced in 2005, named a Madison post office for Robert LaFollette Sr., who served in the U.S. House and Senate, and as Wisconsin’s governor, in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Her House Resolution 1132, introduced in 2007, provided waivers relating to grants to expand screenings and follow-up services for breast and cervical cancer.

And her House Resolution 797, also introduced in 2007, modified standards to allow more veterans to qualify for disability compensation for vision impairment.

While the three did become law, none was a major piece of legislation.

Baldwin response

Asked to respond, Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus said most of her bills had Republican co-sponsors. And he argued that legislation she currently backs is being ""obstructed by the GOP.""

Neither point refutes Fitzgerald’s claim on the number of Baldwin-sponsored bills that have become law. But Kraus also made a third point that goes to Fitzgerald’s suggestion that Baldwin has been unproductive.

Kraus noted U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who also the entered House in 1999, has sponsored 75 bills, with two becoming law. (One named a post office and one modified excise taxes on arrows.)

Neither of those measures qualifies as major legislation, either -- even though Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, is prominent enough to be mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate in 2012.

The implication: Looking strictly at bills passed doesn’t say much about the overall performance of a lawmaker.

""The number of bills introduced that are enacted into law is a blunt and often misleading measure of legislative effectiveness,"" congressional scholar Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., told us. ""Many of the most effective legislators seldom introduce bills themselves but work instead in committee and on the floor to influence the shape of legislation. Paul Ryan is a good case in point.""

We would add that many factors -- such as which party controls Congress and the White House -- affect whether a bill becomes law. And sponsoring legislation is only one of the myriad tasks a House member performs. On her House website, for example, Baldwin claims credit for bringing more than $100 million in federal money to her district.

Our rating

Suggesting that Baldwin has been nearly invisible in Congress, Fitzgerald claimed: ""In her nearly decade and (a) half in Congress, Tammy Baldwin has sponsored 105 bills. Only three have been enacted into law.""

His statement is accurate, but it needs clarification. The number of Baldwin bills that became law is only one measure of her overall record -- and one that can be misleading when viewed in isolation.

"['New Jersey', 'Guns', 'Frank Lautenberg']","
Frank Lautenberg says gun violence claimed more American lives in U.S. than in Iraq and Afghanistan
","
War may be good for one thing: providing U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg with leverage for his argument that the United States needs stricter gun laws.

Lautenberg, who is pushing to reinstate a federal ban on high-capacity ammunition clips in the wake of the deadly mass shooting last month at a Colorado movie theater, said, ""our lax gun laws make it far too easy for murderers to commit acts of violence.""

""Here are the facts: Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. In support of the two wars, more than 6,500 American soldiers have lost their lives. During the same period, however, guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil,"" Lautenberg said in a July 30 op-ed article posted on NorthJersey.com.

Lautenberg’s numbers are technically correct since 2001. In fact, he could have cited just a year of gun violence in the U.S. to make his point. But experts call his comparison flawed and misleading.

""More pickles are consumed in New York City than in Rhode Island. Is that a good comparison? I don’t think so. Because there are way more people in New York City,"" said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the school of criminal justice at The University at Albany.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks murders in the United States through its Uniform Crime Report program. Caley Gray, a spokesman for Lautenberg, cited that source -- which shows more than 8,700 people were murdered in the United States with firearms in 2010 -- to support the senator’s statement.  

Since 2001 -- the year the war in Afghanistan began -- more than 95,000 people have been murdered with a gun in the United States, according to the FBI data.

Though those statistics do not include citizenship status, Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, said ""my reaction is that you can safely assume that the vast majority of murder victims are U.S. citizens.""

That death toll is far higher than the number of U.S. military casualties from the nation’s recent wars.

More than 6,500 U.S. military personnel have died in conflicts from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001, according to data from the U.S. Department of Defense.

Gray said: ""The numbers speak for themselves. The bottom line and the sad truth is that far more Americans are being killed by guns in their own neighborhoods than in deadly war zones.""

But Kleck called the senator’s comparison ""foolish and misleading.""

""Taking account of the very different population sizes at risk, the risk of a gun homicide (or any kind of homicide) is enormously greater in Afghanistan than in the U.S.,"" Kleck said in an e-mail. ""Obviously even one homicide is one too many, but the hinted suggestion that the risk of death from a gun is even remotely as high in the U.S. as in Afghanistan is absurd.""

Lizotte also criticized Lautenberg’s statement for focusing only on the deaths of U.S. troops. ""Many more people were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq than Americans,"" he said.

For example, a July 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service noted that in Afghanistan ""11,864 civilians have been killed in the conflict since 2007, when the United Nations began reporting statistics, to the end of 2011.""

Our ruling

Lautenberg said, ""guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan,"" claiming that ""more than 6,500 American soldiers"" died while ""guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil.""

Though Lautenberg’s numbers are mainly on target, three experts agreed that the senator’s statement is flawed largely because he uses raw numbers to compare two very different populations.

Also, Lautenberg focuses solely on deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, when many more have died in both wars.

We rate this statement Half True.

Michigan Gov. Whitmer said she would veto legislation to limit her emergency powers

An April 27 Instagram post includes a screenshot of a tweet that claims the Michigan Legislature stripped Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of her emergency powers because of the actions she’s taken against COVID-19. The tweet, which was posted April 26, links to a story from Neon Nettle, a website that has published misinformation in the past. ""Michigan's Democrat governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has just been stripped of her emergency coronavirus powers by her state legislature after she abused that power with insane orders such as blocking sales of vegetable seeds and American flags, etc.,"" the post reads. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It has more than 4,700 likes. (Screenshot from Instagram) Whitmer has been the subject of several hoaxes about her handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Michigan, where thousands protested the governor’s stay-at-home orders in mid-April. So we wanted to check out this Instagram post, too. Michigan’s Republican-controlled Legislature has moved to restrict Whitmer’s emergency powers. But the bills have only passed the Senate, and the governor has said she will veto any legislation that restricts executive power during the coronavirus crisis. Plus, Whitmer has not banned the sale of vegetables or American flags, as the post claims, though her orders have restricted the types of retail businesses and store departments that can stay open. Whitmer first declared a state of emergency March 10 and issued a stay-at-home order nearly two weeks later. On April 24, Whitmer signed an executive order to extend the stay-at-home restrictions through May 15, but loosened some provisions.  Although the number of new COVID-19 cases has slightly decreased in Michigan, Whitmer’s aggressive actions against the coronavirus have attracted the ire of Republicans in her state and across the country who say they are unnecessarily strict and harm the economy. Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, has said the governor is turning Michigan into a ""police state."" Several businesses and groups have filed lawsuits challenging the orders. On April 16, Republicans in the state House of Representatives and Senate introduced bills that would repeal the 1945 Emergency Powers of the Governor Act, which gives the governor broad authority to declare a state of emergency in times of ""great public crisis."" Another pair of bills would amend the Emergency Management Act of 1976 to decrease the number of days the governor can declare an emergency from 28 to 14. The Senate versions of both pieces of legislation passed in roll call votes April 24. But, as of April 29, they had not yet passed the House, which is also Republican-controlled. Whitmer has said she will veto the measures. ""Of course, I will veto bills that they send over to limit the executive power. I've been very clear about that from day one,"" she said April 23. ""Those blatant power grabs are bad in good times and dangerous in times of crisis."" The Instagram post also errs in saying that Republicans targeted Whitmer’s emergency powers because she used them to issue orders ""blocking sales of vegetable seeds and American flags."" We rated two similar claims False — Whitmer’s executive orders do not ban the sale of any particular product. Since Michigan legislators have moved to limit the governor’s emergency powers, the Instagram post contains an element of truth. But Whitmer’s emergency powers have not yet been repealed, and she has said she will veto the legislation if and when it reaches her desk.

What Gov. Cuomo got right about disparity between states in COVID-19 funding
","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose daily press briefings on the state’s battle against the coronavirus have drawn wide coverage, has extended his rhetorical reach through social media. On April 12, Cuomo took to Twitter to spotlight what he saw as a disparity in federal funding between New York and states that had fewer coronavirus cases. ""Some states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported COVID-19 case. New York is the hardest-hit state and yet we are getting only about $12,000 per case,"" Cuomo tweeted.  Some states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported COVID-19 case.New York is the hardest-hit state and yet we are getting only about $12,000 per case.We need a fair federal stimulus bill that is distributed by need.   We found that the statement relies on a credible study of how one part of the federal funding is being divided among the states, though it glosses over the fact that it’s counting money going to health care providers directly, rather than to the states themselves. The number of coronavirus cases changes by day, and even by the hour. But at the time he made his claim, Cuomo was correct to say the difference between New York and the other two states was lopsided. New York has been hardest hit by the coronavirus. On April 12, the state reported a cumulative 195,031 known cases of the virus.  Montana and Nebraska, which have far smaller populations, saw much smaller outbreaks of the virus at the time: Montana had 394 reported cases, while Nebraska reported 792.  The money Cuomo is referencing comes from the $2.2 trillion federal coronavirus aid package passed in March, known as the CARES Act.  While that bill earmarked $150 billion directly for state, local and tribal governments, the breakdown Cuomo is referring to comes from a different provision that provides funds directly to hospitals and other health care providers.  This portion of the CARES Act allocates up to $100 billion to health care providers. When Cuomo sent his tweet, $30 billion of that total had been distributed. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, providers have received money from the stimulus bill based on a formula that involves how much money they received from Medicare reimbursements in 2019 (excluding payments under Medicare Advantage, which works through private insurers).  HHS estimated that these Medicare reimbursements amounted to $484 billion in 2019. Because HHS wanted to push the first $30 billion of coronavirus aid out the door quickly, it allocated the money based on providers’ share of these reimbursements from 2019.  In other words, the formula for this first stage of funding had nothing to do with the number of coronavirus cases a state was facing. Using these guidelines, Kaiser Health News, a PolitiFact fact-checking partner, calculated how much money providers in each state had received from the $30 billion. The publication based these numbers on a House Ways and Means Committee funds breakdown and New York Times daily coronavirus numbers.  The analysis was originally published two days before Cuomo’s tweet.  According to Kaiser Health News’ published analysis, hospitals and providers in New York state were due to receive stimulus money amounting to $12,000 per coronavirus case at the time.  Providers in states with fewer cases, such as Montana and Nebraska, had received over $300,000 per case, according to the analysis.  So Cuomo’s tweet tracks what the Kaiser Health News analysis found, though it’s worth noting that the total amount given to New York providers in this initial round, nearly $1.9 billion, was significantly more than what went to the other states: about $111 million for Montana and $225 million for Nebraska, according to the authors of the analysis. Jack Hoadley, an emeritus professor at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute, told PolitiFact New York that the Kaiser study’s methodology was sound. He added that later rounds should address this imbalance. HHS has said that the next wave of the $100 billion will take into account how many coronavirus cases each state has. This ""should respond at least in part to the concern raised by Gov. Cuomo,"" he said, though ""more information is needed before we can assess the dollars-per-patient metric"" down the road. Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the New York State Division of the Budget, told PolitiFact that ""the tweet relied on information from a Kaiser Health News article and quoted it nearly word for word. There’s no question that the facts are accurate and there is a disparity in the federal funding structure among states in this regard."" Cuomo tweeted, ""Some states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported COVID-19 case. New York is the hardest-hit state and yet we are getting only about $12,000 per case,"" In the first round of funding for health care providers, New York state’s providers received far less money per coronavirus case than other, less-affected states, according to a credible analysis. However, Cuomo’s tweet addressed only one part of the federal funding, and it glossed over the distinction between states and health care providers in those states. The funding source Cuomo tweeted about sends money to providers, not the state. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DD8B00>],/factchecks/2020/apr/29/andrew-cuomo/what-gov-cuomo-got-right-about-disparity-between-s/

Trump says N95 masks can be sterilized for reuse. Only in a pinch, experts warn.
","As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, front-line health care workers are decrying unsafe working conditions — in particular, describing inadequate access to personal protective equipment, or PPE. Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available.  But at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear. ""We’re also using a sterilization process ― some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it’s working very well,"" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks — specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 ― has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious — can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it’s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house ""critical care decontamination system,"" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask’s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But ― despite Trump’s enthusiasm — it is not a best practice. ""It’s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,"" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health’s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. ""This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use."" In fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle’s decontamination system ""may be effective"" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for ""when there are insufficient supplies."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse ""only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy."" The reasons are multiple. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it’s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. ""Decontamination is a complicated process,"" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. ""Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research,"" she said.  N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle’s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask’s filtration. Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. At Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear. Battelle’s 20-time reusability metric, he added, was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator’s fit.  ""If [an N95] doesn’t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn’t matter how good a filter it is,"" Kenney said. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected ― since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard — and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility.  ""These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,"" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle’s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. In describing ongoing efforts to reuse protective respirators, Trump said the United States is using ""some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask."" That, he argued, ""is like ordering 20 times more masks."" It is true that technology exists to sterilize N95s up to 20 times. But there are knowledge gaps and other shortcomings that limit how effective this process is. Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as ""ordering 20 times more masks."" The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that undermine the president’s point.

Convalescent plasma therapy showing promise against COVID-19
","As physicians grapple with the best ways to treat patients infected with the coronavirus, one treatment that has gained increasing attention is convalescent plasma therapy. This therapy involves transfusing blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients into a sick patient. The plasma contains a specific antibody that helps the immune system fight the virus. The idea is to help give seriously ill patients an immune-system boost so they can better fight off the virus. COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy is considered as an investigational product by the Food and Drug Administration.  Dr. Jamie N. Nadler, the medical director of quality and patient safety for Buffalo General Medical Center and Gates Vascular Institute in upstate New York, recently told the Buffalo News that there’s some evidence that it could be an effective way to treat COVID-19.  ""There have been small trials and small attempts around the world that seem to have had some degree of success,"" Nadler said. ""So it's worth trying as long as it's done correctly."" Nadler is right: We found two studies of convalescent plasma therapy that have shown  at least initial promise with COVID-19 patients, although experts caution that more investigation is needed. (Nadler did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Convalescent plasma therapy has a long history. It was developed by Paul Ehrlich and Emil von Behring for treatment of diphtheria, a finding that was recognized in 1901 with the first Nobel Prize for medicine, epidemiologist Dr. Ian Lipkin, a professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told CNBC.  More recently, it was used against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, an infection with similarities to COVID-19 that emerged in Asia in the early 2000s.  In one study in Hong Kong during a SARS outbreak, a hospital treated 80 patients with convalescent plasma. Among the treated patients, the study showed a higher discharge rate prior to day 14 of the illness: 58.3% became well enough to be discharged, compared with 15.6% of those who did not receive the treatment. However, patients suffering from Ebola — a different kind of virus in the filovirus family — did not experience positive results from convalescent plasma treatment.  A Chinese study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, described a study treating five critically ill COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma. All five patients, ranging from 36 to 65 years old, began the study while on ventilators.  Following the transfusion, the authors reported, four of the five patients’ body temperatures normalized within three days. Other key metrics, including viral loads, improved within 12 days. The hospital discharged three of the five patients. The remaining two were in stable condition 37 days after the transfusion.  The authors concluded that this represented an ""improvement,"" but cautioned that the limited sample size and study design precluded ""a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment."" Another Chinese study found similar results. It has not yet been peer reviewed but has been published online.  In the study, 10 patients with severe cases received a dose of convalescent plasma. Within three days, the viral load became undetectable in seven patients, with no adverse effects. In addition, fever, cough, shortness of breath and chest pain disappeared or significantly improved in all 10 patients within one to three days of the transfusion.   The authors concluded that the therapy was ""well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes"" in severe COVID-19 cases. However, they added, questions on the optimal dose and timing need further investigation. ""Just as COVID-19 has taken us back to classic methods for outbreak containment like isolation, through a novel use we are rediscovering the lifesaving potential of a classic strategy like plasma therapy,"" Lipkin said.  Experts say that convalescent plasma therapy is promising, but much more work is needed. ""There have not been any breakthroughs recently,"" said Jessica Donington, a professor of surgery at the University of Chicago and chief of the thoracic surgery section. But, she added, ""it all has been going on very quickly,"" with larger clinical trials in the works. Nadler said that ""there have been small trials and small attempts around the world"" to test convalescent plasma therapy for coronavirus patients, and they ""seem to have had some degree of success.""

"['Coronavirus', 'Steve Bannon']","
Did Fauci tell U.S. 'not to worry about' coronavirus?
","Former White House advisor Steve Bannon has been defending President Donald Trump against criticism that he was slow  responding to the coronavirus. Bannon recently lauded Trump's Jan. 31 order restricting travel with China, the original source of the virus. Bannon said the action came while a key medical adviser - Anthony Fauci,  director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases - was saying COVID-19 was not a threat to the United States. ""Fauci told us there’s nothing to worry about. That’s his quote, ‘There’s nothing to worry about,’"" Bannon said during an April 14 radio interview on The John Fredericks Show, a conservative broadcast based in Portsmouth, Va. We fact-checked Bannon’s claim. Bannon, a Richmond, Va. native, cited two instances in late January when Fauci said the disease wasn’t a big threat to Americans. Each time, however, Fauci added that the situation could change. On Jan. 21 - the day the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. was confirmed - Fauci appeared on conservative Newsmax TV. ""Bottom line, we don’t have to worry about this one, right?"" asked Greg Kelly, the host. Fauci said, ""Obviously, you need to take it seriously and do the kind of things the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the Department of Homeland Security is doing. But this is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about."" So Fauci, in a qualified response said, don't worry ""right now;"" ""you need to take it seriously;"" and although ""this is not a major threat,""  keep an ear open to the CDC and Homeland Security.  On Jan. 26, Fauci gave an interview to John Catsimatidis, a syndicated radio host in New York. ""What can you tell the American people about what’s been going on?"" Catsimatidis asked. ""Should they be scared?"" ""I don’t think so,"" Fauci said. ""The American people should not be worried or frightened by this. It’s a very, very low risk to the United States, but it’s something we, as public health officials, need to take very seriously."" Fauci reiterated that the COVID-19 ""isn’t something the American people need to worry about or be frightened about"" because, at the time, it was centered in China and the U.S. could screen travelers from that nation.  But Fauci also twice described the virus as ""an evolving situation,"" and said, ""Every day, we have to look at it very carefully.""   On April 13, PolitiFact National examined a tweet by Republican DeAnna Lorraine, a unsuccessful California congressional candidate. She said Fauci ""was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and (COVID-19) posed no threat to the US public at large."" Lorraine’s statement was ruled Mostly False. Although Fauci said that day he saw no immediate need for social distancing, PolitiFact noted that his comments were ""filled with caveats that the situation could change."" And contrary to Lorraine’s tweet, Fauci’s didn’t say then ""there was nothing to worry about."" Bannon’s remark is based on different Fauci statements from an earlier time with different words and different context. Bannon said, ""Fauci told us there’s nothing to worry about. That’s his quote, ‘There’s nothing to worry about.’"" Fauci did say twice in late January, when there was one reported COVID-19 case in the U.S., that American shouldn’t worry about the virus. But Bannon omits an important detail: Both times, Fauci added that the situation could change. So we rate Bannon’s statement Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280970568C0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/29/steve-bannon/did-fauci-tell-us-not-worry-about-coronavirus/

UV radiation is not a common way to kill viruses and bacteria in the body
","Health experts have debunked President Donald Trump’s idea to potentially use sunlight to treat coronavirus patients. But some social media users say the president is onto something. An April 24 Facebook post shows an image of what appears to be someone hooked up to an IV that is emanating blue light. The caption claims it shows a ""UV radiation"" treatment. ""For all you dummies that have absolutely no idea what trump is talking about... INTERNAL DISINFECTANT aka Ultraviolet Radiation is administered into the body as a ‘disinfectant’ to kill bacteria and viruses and this has been used for a while now,"" reads the post.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) During an April 23 press briefing, Trump floated the idea of using light to treat COVID-19 patients after a Department of Homeland Security official presented a preliminary study that found sunlight kills the coronavirus on certain surfaces. We found no evidence to suggest such a treatment would work on patients, but we wanted to take a closer look at this recent Facebook post. While the exact origin of the image in the post is unclear, its central claim — that some health care providers inject UV light into patients to kill bacteria and viruses — is inaccurate. We reached out to the original poster for evidence, but we haven’t heard back. We used a reverse image search to scour the internet for the source of the photo in the Facebook post. While we couldn’t find the source, we did find several tweets from the same day that included the image. One user who shared the photo claimed it shows ultraviolet blood irradiation (UBI). The treatment involves drawing a patient’s blood, then exposing that blood to an external light box before returning it to the body. It was popular in the mid-20th century before the development of antibiotics and was used to treat conditions including pneumonia, tuberculosis, arthritis and asthma.. Now UBI is mainly used in the alternative-medicine community. But UV light is not ""administered"" into patients’ bodies, as the Facebook post claims, and experts who have experimented with the treatment say there is no scientific evidence that it kills bacteria or viruses. Dr. Edzard Ernst, an emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, said the research into UBI and related methods has been limited in scope. ""Yes, there are quite a few papers on UBI and related methods. But most of them are in-vitro studies, while robust clinical trials are missing completely,"" Ernst wrote in an April 25 blog post. ""Needless to say also that UBI is an invasive treatment where lots of things might go badly wrong."" RELATED: Why Trump’s comments on using disinfectants, sunlight to treat COVID-19 are wrong There are three types of UV light: UVA, UVB and UVC. The first makes up the majority of radiation that reaches the Earth, the second can cause sunburn and skin cancer, and the third destroys genetic material. Applying UVC light to rooms and surfaces has helped some hospitals cut the transmission rate of diseases like MRSA, which can linger in rooms after patients are discharged. The light waves kill bacteria and viruses by disrupting their DNA. But applying UVC light directly to the body would damage genetic material and cause burns within seconds, experts told PolitiFact. Physicians do sometimes use UVA or UVB light to treat skin lymphoma, but they avoid giving patients too much, as it could increase their chances of developing skin cancer later in life. ""There is a modified version of this in which a drug can be injected ahead of time to increase cell sensitivity to externally applied UV, but in general it’s not possible to inject UV light itself,"" said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, an associate research scientist at Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity, in an email. Health care providers also sometimes treat donated blood or plasma with radiation before performing infusions to prevent certain diseases, but most American blood banks use gamma rays or x-rays. That’s different from using UV light to treat blood or plasma that’s still inside a patient.  ""There is no evidence that injecting UV light into the body will kill bacteria or viruses,"" said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, a clinical assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University, in an email. ""We irradiate blood that has been taken out of the body, but that is different than using UV light. I am not sure what that picture is in the Facebook post."" The Facebook post is inaccurate.

No, Sweden is not faring the same as its locked down neighbors
","Attacked by the coronavirus, superpowers such as the United States retreated into lockdown, deeming it the smartest way to stop the spread of the disease. Sweden, which hasn’t been in a shooting war in two centuries, faced the enemy by arming its citizens mostly with guidelines, not stay-at-home orders. That strategy, according to a widely circulated Facebook post, has been as effective as the shutdown policy adopted by two of Sweden’s neighbors.    ""Sweden has zero lockdown"" but ""is in no worse shape than Denmark or Norway, which are currently experiencing full lockdown,"" the post claims. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On key data points, each of which has limitations, Sweden is faring worse than Denmark and Norway. Sweden has a population of 10 million people, nearly nine out of 10 of whom live in urban areas. As we reported in a fact-check comparing Sweden with Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, Sweden has imposed no lockdown and no quarantines, although gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Elementary schools, bars, restaurants and businesses are still open, though with social distancing and other safety measures encouraged. What’s happening in Sweden seems like something closer to life as most Americans remember it before much of the country was shut down. The idea in Sweden is to essentially pursue herd immunity — let the virus spread as slowly as possible while sheltering the elderly and the vulnerable until much of the population becomes naturally immune, or a vaccine becomes available. In contrast, Denmark and Norway closed their restaurants and ski slopes and told all students to stay home. Norway required most people returning from abroad to enter a two-week quarantine and limited groups outdoors to no more than five people. Denmark closed its borders, sent public workers home with pay and encouraged all other employees to work from home.  Here are some of the major metrics on how Sweden (which also borders Finland) compares with Denmark and Norway. We’re including the United States for informational value. The figures are from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, who is director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford.  All data are as of April 19, the date of the Facebook post. Confirmed infection rate: Sweden rising faster Sweden has a higher confirmed infection rate than Denmark and Norway. The measure is the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people. United States: 2,220.79 Sweden: 1,368.61 Norway: 1,288.27 Denmark: 1,250.3 The differences among Sweden, Norway and Denmark are not significant, Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told PolitiFact. But the total number of confirmed cases is increasing faster in Sweden than in Norway and Denmark — even though Sweden is doing less testing per 1,000 people than Norway and Denmark. Anders Tegnell, the epidemiologist who is credited with developing Sweden’s COVID-19 strategy, says infection rate is an unreliable measure of how a country is doing. ""The recorded infection rate depends hugely on the number of tests performed and what indications for testing that are used,"" Tegnell, the director of the Swedish Public Health Agency, told PolitiFact for a previous fact-check.  Helen Jenkins, a Boston University professor of biostatistics, also told us she wouldn’t rely on that measure because of how much testing varies among countries. One way to compare COVID-19 deaths is the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases. Sweden’s is more than twice as high as Denmark’s and more than five times higher than Norway’s. Sweden: 10.93%  United States: 5.29% Denmark: 4.78% Norway: 2.12% Even though this case fatality rate is commonly discussed, during an outbreak it is a poor measure of the true risk of death, Our World in Data says. That’s because the rate relies on the number of confirmed cases, and many cases are not confirmed. And it relies on the total number of deaths; and with COVID-19, some people who are sick will die soon but have not yet died.  Another measure is COVID-19 deaths per million people. Again, Sweden’s is higher than Denmark’s and Norway’s. Sweden: 149.61 United States: 117.55 Denmark: 59.74 Norway: 27.3 This per-capita death rate ""is a better measure of the severity of the issue,"" Kates said. Per capita case rates may, or may not, include everyone who needs to be tested, but not everyone who gets infected will get sick or die, she said. And deaths reported are less dependent on testing capacity than cases. Tegnell has said Sweden’s death toll ""is not a failure for the overall strategy,"" but rather ""a failure to protect our elderly who live in care homes."" Overall, Jenkins cautioned against drawing conclusions on comparing the three countries, given that the outbreak is still unfolding.  ""This is not over yet; in fact, it’s just starting,"" she told PolitiFact. ""Hard to judge the full impact of lockdown or not right at the moment.""  Another expert, Paul Franks, a genetic-epidemiology professor at Lund University in Sweden, wrote on April 23 that studies indicate that ""we should soon expect infections and deaths in Stockholm,"" Sweden’s largest city, ""to drop substantially in the coming weeks.""  Peter Callerfelt, 43, who owns a recruiting consulting business in Stockholm, said he believes it’s too soon to judge Sweden’s policy. He appreciates that he and his wife can still commute to their offices, where they are almost completely isolated from co-workers, and that their daughter can still go to kindergarten. Callerfelt told PolitiFact that Sweden's policy is set by the country's health experts, not elected officials, and that citizens respond to the experts' recommendations. He wonders whether people in Norway and Denmark would comply with a second shutdown if their countries reopened and then the virus reappeared, whereas Sweden has more flexibility. ""If this is not enough, you can still have the ace left and say, OK, now we’re doing a total lockdown. In the other countries, they have nothing left to play,"" Callerfelt said. A Facebook post claims that amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden has no lockdown and ""is in no worse shape than Denmark or Norway,"" which are in lockdown. It goes too far to say Sweden has no lockdown, in that gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited.  The claim has an element of truth in that Sweden has roughly the same number of confirmed cases per million people as Denmark and Norway. But it’s misleading to say that Sweden is doing no worse. The total number of confirmed cases is increasing at a faster rate in Sweden than in Norway and Denmark — even though Sweden is doing less testing per 1,000 people than Norway and Denmark. Moreover, Sweden has higher death rates. For a statement with some truth that ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809702DA80>],/factchecks/2020/apr/28/facebook-posts/sweden-mostly-open-has-higher-covid-19-death-rate-/

Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Vos sparks legal conundrum with claim to ‘constitutional’ status
","On March 4, 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic was knocking on Wisconsin’s door, Gov. Tony Evers convened a meeting at the Capitol so state health officials could brief lawmakers on preparations.  In the end, only nine of 132 state lawmakers attended the briefing, including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester.  Several other legislative leaders -- including Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau; Senate President Roger Roth, R-Appleton, and Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh -- sent staffers. The briefing by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, broadcast live on the WisconsinEye public affairs network and posted on YouTube, was conducted by Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm. Evers himself did not attend.  ""It was surprising to me today that I was the only constitutional officer that came,"" Vos said after the briefing.  That caught our attention, and not just on the basis of attendance.  Vos has referred to himself as a ""constitutional officer"" numerous times -- including in comparing himself to Evers.  One example: On the Jan. 23, 2020 ""Dan O’Donnell Show"" on 1130 WISN-AM, Vos said, ""the constitution basically says that the three branches are co-equal. So that means that, you know, when I meet with Governor Evers, we are his constitutional equal.""  In the wake of the Evers vs. GOP battle over what to do about the April 7 election amid the coronavirus outbreak, and as Vos and Republicans have gone to court to challenge Evers over his plans to extend the state’s safer-at-home order, we decided to do a little research into the state constitution. What does it say about the role of the Assembly Speaker? We talked to a wide range of legal experts on this one, and there was -- predictably -- a range of opinions.  But let’s start with what everyone agreed upon: A constitutional office is one created by the constitution. That’s the definition used by the website USLegal.com: A constitutional officer ""is a government official whose office is created by a constitution, rather than by a statute. The term of office of such officers are fixed and defined by the constitution."" In the Wisconsin constitution, there are six state-level officers listed: Governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, state superintendent of public instruction, secretary of state, and state treasurer. Case closed? Not entirely. The state constitution, of course, talks about many other other elected positions, at various levels of government. For instance, it mentions county sheriffs, judges, district attorneys, even coroners. And, of course, it talks about the state Legislature. Vos is a state lawmaker, and that role is mentioned. But when he made his claim he was talking specifically about his role as Assembly Speaker -- not the fact he is one of 99 elected members of the Assembly. Remember: Eight other lawmakers attended the meeting after which Vos claimed he was the only constitutional officer present. So, we will look at it from that perspective. Here, the constitution is less declarative -- and where different interpretations come in. To be sure, the constitution does not even set a specific number of state lawmakers, saying only: ""The number of the members of the assembly shall never be less than fifty-four nor more than one hundred. The senate shall consist of a number not more than one-third nor less than one-fourth of the number of the members of the assembly."" At the same time, it also says this: ""Each house shall choose its presiding officers from its own members.""  ""There is no constitutional provision that creates a position called ‘Speaker of the Assembly,’"" said Madison attorney Lester Pines, who typically represents Democrats and related causes. ""It exists by custom and tradition. The Legislature could at any time choose to eliminate the position of ‘speaker.’"" Rick Esenberg, president of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, agreed on that point -- ""the legislature wouldn't have to have one"" -- but noted the constitution does recognize there would be a leadership position. ""So the constitution does authorize the creation of an office like his and provides that the legislature decides who will hold such an office,"" he said. ""This reflects a determination that the legislature should organize itself. So, in that sense, he could be called a constitutional officer.""  Marquette University law professor Ed Fallone, who has twice sought a seat on the state Supreme Court, took a slightly different approach. He said the phrase ""constitutional officer"" has a specific meaning in Wisconsin, in that it refers to public officials who are elected at the county-wide level.  ""Beyond this specific meaning, it is also common to use the phrase ‘constitutional officer’ when referring generally to a particular group of elected officials who are elected statewide and who exercise executive powers, namely the Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, State Treasurer and Secretary of State,"" he said in an email. ""The point is that these offices are all elected statewide, by the voters of the entire state.  Members of the legislature are elected by the voters of their district, and not in a statewide election."" Ryan Nilsestuen, chief legal counsel to the governor’s office, offered a similar point, and noted even the state Blue Book, produced by the Legislative Reference Bureau, ""distinguishes between statewide elected officials (i.e., the six constitutional officers) and the legislative body."" Fallone did not say whether it was right or wrong to use ""constitutional officer"" in the context used by Vos. ""I think that it is unusual for members of the Legislature to call themselves ‘constitutional officers,’ and it strikes me as an attempt by members of the legislature to bolster their own self-importance by claiming to belong to the elite club of state leaders who are elected statewide,"" Fallone said in an email.  Vos communications director Kit Beyer did not respond to emails seeking comment. Vos refers to himself, in his role as Assembly Speaker, as a ""constitutional officer.""  But that position is not among those specifically mentioned in the constitution, a roster of roles that is generally understood to refer to statewide positions such as governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. At the same time, the constitution says the Assembly and Senate must designate presiding officers. So, a position such as the one Vos holds is anticipated by the document. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Half True.

Biden plotted to kidnap John F. Kennedy Jr.? Another unsubstantiated conspiracy
","A widespread Facebook post falsely claims that former Vice President Joe Biden was once part of a scheme to kidnap John F. Kennedy Jr., the son of former President John F.

The post is the latest in a series of unsubstantiated conspiracies related to the younger Kennedy, who died in 1999 when a plane he was piloting crashed in the Atlantic Ocean.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Kennedy Jr. has become a favorite figure of QAnon conspiracy theorists, some of whom claim that he is not only alive, but also the leader in their movement known in online forums as ""Q.""  Other Facebook posts have previously claimed, without evidence, that Kennedy once touted the possibility of a Donald Trump presidency in a magazine, and that his plane crash occurred days after he was declared the frontrunner in a race for the Senate seat Hillary Clinton later held. Our research found that the latest post about Biden is also inaccurate. The claim hinges on a collection of FBI records that the Associated Press obtained in 2000 through a Freedom of Information Request. According to the records, which remain heavily redacted, Kennedy was the target of at least three kidnapping threats before he died. The threats came in 1972, when Kennedy was in elementary school; in 1985, shortly after he graduated from Brown University; and in 1995, when he was 38 years old. None of the plots involved Biden, who was a senator from 1973 to 2009, when he became vice president. Biden was mentioned in the FBI files as a ""victim"" — not as a suspect.  That’s because in 1994, Biden received a death threat in a letter postmarked from Worcester, Mass., that prompted an FBI investigation. ""Dear Sen. Biden: You are a traitor …,"" the letter said, according to the FBI records. It was signed, ""John F. Kennedy Jr."" But the case was eventually closed with no suspects identified, according to the records.  ""The FBI dismissed it as a hoax,"" said Steven M. Gillon, professor of history at the University of Oklahoma and author of a recent biography about Kennedy, adding that the FBI chose not to pursue the letter ""because they did not believe that John wrote it."" Gillon said he got access through a lawsuit to thousands of pages of documents related to Kennedy’s life and death, which he reviewed while writing his biography. The documents were mostly about Kennedy’s death, Gillon told us, but some were about threats against him. ""There is no mention, none at all, of a Biden attempt to kidnap JFK Jr.,"" Gillon said. ""The statement (in the Facebook post) is false."" We found no credible reports implicating Biden in any kidnapping threats while searching Google and the Nexis database, either.

Early date on CARES Act is due to a legislative quirk, not a plot
","The coronavirus pandemic has generated a torrent of conspiracy theories. One of them is that the U.S. government somehow planned the pandemic. An April 26 Facebook post sought to prove its case by showing a screenshot of a Wikipedia-like page describing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, more commonly known as the CARES Act.  The $2.2 trillion act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, included direct payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small business and other relief measures. The page captured in the screenshot lists the bill as having been introduced on Jan. 24, 2017. That’s more than three years before the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, which the post cites as evidence that the pandemic was a long-planned event. The poster added the comment, ""Clearly a PLAN-DEMIC. Guess what they have planned next for you. Hint — None of it is in your best interest. Hint 2 — It's much worse than you could ever imagine."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In reality, there’s a mundane explanation for why the bill was introduced well before the pandemic itself, and it has nothing to do with a government plot. But explaining it requires a short lesson in constitutional law and how Congress works. Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution says that bills related to raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives before moving to the Senate for consideration. Sometimes, lawmakers decide that revenue-related legislation must pass urgently, and the shortest path is to skip the normal House-to-Senate process. That was the case with the CARES Act.  While the Democratic House majority did offer a version of the bill, negotiators from the White House and the Senate were already deep into talks about what should be in the bill. When the Senate came up with a version of the bill that the leaders in both parties could support, they drew up the legislative text to be voted on. However, because of the constitutional rule on tax-related bills, the senators didn’t create a new Senate bill. Instead, they took an existing bill that had been passed by the House but not by the Senate. The Senate stripped out the language, inserted the new CARES Act wording into the shell, and voted on it. It passed unanimously, and was later passed by the House and signed by President Donald Trump. What the Senate did is a ""commonly used workaround,"" said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in legislative procedure. The original House bill had been to repeal the ""Cadillac tax"" on high-cost insurance plans, which was part of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. It was introduced on Jan. 24, 2019, (not 2017, as the image in the post says) and easily passed the House on July 17, 2019, 419-6. The bill never made it to a vote in the Senate, making the measure ripe for the picking when Senate leaders went looking for a House-passed measure where the CARES Act language could be swapped in. The bill that passed the Senate ""bears zero resemblance to the original bill,"" Koger said. And the introduction date signifies nothing about when the government knew of the coronavirus. This same tactic was used in the subsequent coronavirus response bill that added more funding for small-business loans, said Donald R. Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The process used to enact the CARES Act, Koger said, shows that ""the modern Congress often bears little resemblance to the ‘How a Bill Becomes a Law’ lessons"" people learn in school. Facebook posts said the government must have planned the coronavirus pandemic because the coronavirus relief bill had been introduced three years earlier. The introduction date cited in the post was off by two years, and the post is a misunderstanding of how the bill moved through Congress.  Because of a constitutional requirement that tax-related bills originate in the House, the senators who drew up the CARES Act used a common workaround, stripping an existing House-passed bill of its old text and inserting the new text into it.  So there’s nothing fishy about a coronavirus relief bill having been introduced prior to the pandemic’s emergence. The original text of the bill that eventually became the CARES Act was on an entirely different topic.

While mosquitoes can transmit some illnesses such as malaria, we found no evidence that COVID-19 is spread through mosquitoes. It is a respiratory virus that spreads between people, public health agencies say. ""To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes,"" says the World Health Organization on a myth-busting page. The main driver of COVID-19 transmission, based on available data, is people who have symptoms, WHO spokeswoman Carla Drysdale told PolitiFact. COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, the WHO found. ""The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person,"" said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For a virus to pass to a person through a mosquito or tick bite, the virus must be able to replicate inside the mosquito or tick, said Joseph M Conlon, an adviser for the American Mosquito Control Association. ""None of the coronaviruses have been shown to do that,"" he said. However, mosquitoes can factor into the severity of the disease if a patient has underlying medical issues due to mosquito-borne diseases, Conlon said.  ""Mosquito-borne viruses such as West Nile virus and dengue fever have not disappeared as COVID-19 has usurped the media landscape,"" he said. ""As potential contributors to severe outcomes, their prevention/control becomes even more critical."" Though the WHO and CDC have said mosquitoes don’t transmit COVID-19, ProPublica reported that an internal briefing memo showed that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched its own study into the matter. The USDA did not respond to ProPublica’s questions. We tried to confirm the memo ourselves but did not hear back from the agency. A Facebook post said mosquitoes can transfer COVID-19 ""from person to person"" Major health organizations said that mosquitoes do not transfer the virus. Instead, it is transferred via droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. Without evidence to support the claim, we rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B1D240>],/factchecks/2020/apr/27/facebook-posts/no-proof-mosquitoes-transfer-covid-19-between-peop/

Crowded beaches in Arizona? Coronavirus spoof fools the unwary
","Some people just don’t get a joke. An April 22 Facebook post had a mock screenshot of beachgoers crammed cheek by jowl to enjoy the waves at Arizona’s ever popular seaside. The image looked as though it was pulled from television news and under the headline, ""Crowded beaches in AZ,"" was the summary ""People defying stay-at-home order fill Arizona beaches."" (We tweaked the image to avoid spreading bad information.)  Some users appreciated the phony timestamp of 0:01. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We might have given this item a pass as all in good fun. Except some users were taken in. ""Are people really that ignorant?"" one person commented. ""Wow, this took me forever until I realized AZ doesn’t have beaches, does it?"" said another. Arizona has much to recommend it, but ocean frontage isn’t one of them. The closest major beach lies along the Gulf of California, in Mexico, about 50 miles from the border.   Source: Google Maps Arizona does have its sandy deserts, and it has plenty of places to swim. There are lakes, rivers and swimming holes, with small patches of sand. Lake Havasu State Park on the state’s western border with California has some beachfront looking out on its placid reservoir. But the surfing is a lot better at Muizenberg Beach in Cape Town, South Africa, which is where this image appears to be from, judging by the row of painted huts on the sand. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey issued a stay-at-home order that runs through April 30, and has made no decision on whether to extend it. He said he’ll be looking at the trends in coronavirus cases. Meanwhile, save your swimsuit for Arizona’s swimming holes and go after the crisis passes.

Chris Larson has no basis to connect spike in new coronavirus cases to election
","Politicians and armchair epidemiologists alike can’t seem to help themselves from making political hay from Wisconsin’s coronavirus trends. And many are struggling to use the data accurately. An April 17, 2020, article widely shared on Facebook claimed the in-person election had caused a ""surge"" in new cases. We rated that False. Four days later, the state’s Republican legislative leaders said the state was ""clearly"" seeing a decline. That was Mostly False. Now a Democratic state senator is again tying an uptick in cases to the state’s mid-pandemic election. Spoiler alert: The data work is still poor. Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, posted the following points on Facebook on April 23: 19 - # of new COVID-19 cases linked to the April 7 election, per DHS. 5 - # of National Guard members displaying COVID-19 symptoms after assisting in the election. 57% - single-day increase in new COVID-19 cases two weeks after the election, compared with the previous two-week average. Yet, some would say, it was ""incredibly safe to go out."" It's time we base decisions on science and the best information available, instead of what we think will benefit us politically. We’re zooming on the 57% claim.  There was indeed a large spike in cases April 22. But Larson is off base attributing that to the election. Let’s see if Larson lived up to his own call to use the ""best information available."" Asked for evidence of the claim, Justin Bielinski, who joined Larson’s office as communications director April 21, claimed the post did not attribute the jump in cases to the election. ""The claim was not that the jump was ‘due to’ or caused by the election, but merely that it was linked,"" Bielinski said in an email. ""Linked is meant to convey correlation."" That, frankly, doesn’t make any sense. The entirety of Larson’s post was about the election, and it described the April 22 increase as occurring ""two weeks after the election."" Larson followed that by quoting an oft-criticized ""incredibly safe"" statement Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, made while working the polls on Election Day in full protective gear. The only reasonable takeaway for readers is that Larson is claiming the election had something to do with the increase. A cursory glance at the data, or headlines around the state, show jumps around April 22 weren’t about the election in general, but one outlier county. Brown County has seen a tremendous surge in new cases due to a COVID-19 outbreak at several meat-packing plants. From April 19 to April 24, the county jumped from 215 confirmed cases to 605. County health officials have traced about half those cases to meatpacking employees and their families, primarily from JBS Packerland in Green Bay. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration are both investigating. But let’s turn back to April 22, the date Larson cited. Wisconsin posted a record 225 new cases that day, after averaging 152 per day the week leading up to that. (As usual, the change in new cases corresponded with a change in testing, which rose to 1,886 on April 22 compared to an average of 1,558 the preceding week). But Brown County accounted for 88 of those cases. Officials haven’t said exactly how many of those 88 were meat-packing related, but they have said there is no evidence linking the recent spike and the April 7 election. If we take Brown County out of the equation, the number of new cases in Wisconsin was 137, not far off the daily average of 121 over the preceding week. Of course, there have been coronavirus cases linked to the election. And officials say it’s too soon to say for sure what impact the election had on the coronavirus trends in Wisconsin. On April 21, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services said 19 people who voted or worked the polls April 7 had tested positive, but officials said there is ""no way to know with certainty"" if they contracted the illness at the polls or somewhere else. And those were factored into the state tallies before the April 22 spike Larson zeroed in on. Larson referred to an April 22 jump in new coronavirus cases as coming ""two weeks after the election,"" then mocked Vos’ quote about the election being ""incredibly safe."" The obvious takeaway is that the jump and election are related. We haven’t seen any evidence that’s true. The increase that day was due in large part to a spike in Brown County, where outbreaks at meat-packing plants led to a surge in new cases. Brown County officials say there has been no evidence of a link between their case surge and the election. We can’t say for sure how the election impacted the April 22 statistics, but connecting the entirety of that day’s increase to the election is an exaggeration. We rate Larson’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A489D40>],/factchecks/2020/apr/24/chris-larson/chris-larson-has-no-basis-connect-spike-new-corona/

Fact-checking Sweden’s COVID-19 infection rate without shutdown
","While cheering President Donald Trump’s ideas for ""opening up America"" amid COVID-19, the Rev. Franklin Graham suggested on Facebook that Trump’s ""enemies and the liberal media"" want a prolonged national shutdown in order to prevent Trump from being re-elected. The Christian minister and son of Billy Graham, the late evangelist, also made a claim about Sweden and its contrarian approach to combating the coronavirus. ""I read yesterday that Sweden had not shut down, but their people were following social distancing and other protocols with the government stressing personal responsibility, and their infection rate still remains lower than the UK’s, Italy’s and Spain’s,"" Graham wrote in an April 17 post on Facebook.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) After PolitiFact published a rating on this statement April 24, Graham edited his original Facebook post to remove reference to the infection rate. Data support Graham’s claim about infection rates. But the epidemiologist credited with developing Sweden’s COVID-19 strategy said infection rate is not a reliable indicator of how a country is doing.  Sweden has a population of 10 million people, nearly nine out of 10 of whom live in urban areas; about 20% of residents were born abroad. In contrast to most of the United States, Sweden has imposed no lockdown and no quarantines, although groups of larger than 50 people are banned. With elementary schools, bars, restaurants and businesses still open, though with social distancing and other safety measures encouraged, what’s happening in Sweden seems like something closer to life as most Americans remember it. The idea in Sweden is to essentially pursue herd immunity — let the virus spread as slowly as possible while sheltering the elderly and the vulnerable until much of the population becomes naturally immune or a vaccine becomes available. We didn’t get replies when we asked for information from two North Carolina-based organizations led by Graham, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and the international relief organization Samaritan's Purse. We found infection-rate figures from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, who is director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford.  Here are the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1 million people as of April 17, the day of Graham’s post: Spain: 3,910.1 Italy: 2,794.18 United States: 2,028.17 United Kingdom: 1,518.62 Sweden: 1,241.67 So, Sweden’s known rate of infections is lower than the other countries Graham mentioned (and lower than the U.S. rate, as well).  We’ll note that Our World in Data figures for April 17 show that the death rate — the ratio of confirmed deaths to confirmed cases — in Sweden was slightly higher than Spain’s, though lower than the other countries Graham cites.  United Kingdom: 13.32% Italy: 13.12% Sweden: 10.63% Spain: 10.46% United States: 4.96% Sweden’s death rate was much higher, however, than the three countries that border it: Denmark: 4.67%; Finland: 2.23%; Norway: 2%. Experts urge caution on reading too much into the infection-rate figures that Graham alludes to. Testing has been focused on health care workers and people whose cases who are serious enough to end up in the hospital, so we don’t know the number of people infected who suffer mild or no symptoms, wrote Paul Franks, a genetic epidemiology professor at Lund University in Sweden and an adjunct professor at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health. ""The existing data suggest that the infection rates are probably much higher in Stockholm than in London and a little higher across Sweden than across the UK,"" he told PolitiFact. Indeed, Anders Tegnell, the epidemiologist who is credited with developing Sweden’s COVID-19 strategy, says infection rate is not a good measure of how a country is doing. ""The recorded infection rate depends hugely on the number of tests performed and what indications for testing that are used,"" Tegnell, the director of the Swedish Public Health Agency, told PolitiFact. ""In other words, an unreliable measure."" Asked if Sweden’s strategy has been effective, Tegnell told us: ""Partly, to the extent that the health system managed the challenge and that there are always free beds. Not so well in protecting the elderly."" As we were preparing this fact-check, there were reports that confirmed infections in Sweden were rising sharply. For example, according to The Guardian, Sweden reported 812 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on April 24, the highest number of new cases in the country yet reported. At the same time, if Swedish studies are accurate, infections and deaths in Stockholm, where more than half of the country’s COVID-19 deaths have occurred, should ""drop substantially in the coming weeks,"" Franks wrote on April 23.  Urging that the reopening of the United States not be delayed, Graham said the COVID-19 infection rate in Sweden, which has no forced lockdown, is lower than in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Infection rates are lower, but that’s not necessarily a telling metric. Experts, including the epidemiologist credited with devising Sweden’s no-lockdown strategy, said there are other reasons, including a lack of testing, not to read too much into infection rates as a measure of how well a country is responding to the virus. Sweden’s death rates, for example, are higher than some of its peers.  For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True. UPDATE, April 27, 2020: This story has been updated to reflect that Graham edited his original April 17 Facebook post to remove reference to Sweden's COVID-19 infection rate following the April 24 publication of this fact-check.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A48E8C0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/24/franklin-graham/fact-checking-swedens-covid-infection-rate-without/

No, Pastor David Wilkerson did not predict that the COVID-19 pandemic would shut down the economy
","A Facebook post from the Jerusalem Prayer Team, an American Christian-Zionist organization  says a 1986 prophecy foretold of a plague like COVID-19 hitting New York City.  The post says that David Wilkerson, the late founder of the Times Square Church, told Mike Evans, the leading pastor of the Jerusalem Prayer Team, the following:  ""I see a plague coming on the world and the bars and church and government will shut down. The plague will hit New York City and shake it like it has never been shaken. The plague is going to force prayerless believers into radical prayer and into their Bibles and repentance will be the cry from the man of God in the pulpit. And out of it will come a third Great Awakening that will sweep America and the world."" There is no evidence that Wilkerson, who died in 2011, actually made this prediction.  PolitiFact reached out to the Times Square Church, the non-denominational church that Wilkerson established in 1987, and a spokesperson there said, ""The church is not aware of Pastor David ever writing that in any of his books or sermons."" We did not receive a response to multiple inquiries to the Jerusalem Prayer Team. The Facebook post instructs readers to click on a link, where they can find video, transcript and a prophetic message from Evans as well as the ""entire prophecy from David Wilkerson."" That page then instructs readers to enter their email address to receive a free speech by Evans where he shares Wilkerson’s prediction. The speech says Evans met Wilkerson for breakfast in 1986 at an Embassy Suites hotel near the Dallas-Fort Worth airport in Texas. There, according to Evans, Wilkerson predicted a plague so strong that it would shut down restaurants and bars in New York City.  Evans writes that Wilkerson pointed him to the Bible’s Old Testament Book of Isaiah, where it says that ""every house will be shut up, and no one will be coming or going. The city of confusion is broken down, and every house is shut up that no man may come in."" The book of Isaiah, which Judeo-Christian tradition holds was written by a prophet by the same name, does address a plague that forces people to stay inside and shuts down an economy. But it doesn’t explicitly point to the coronavirus hitting New York City. Chapter 24 is believed to describe the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah due to man’s inability to follow God’s covenant.  Evans is promoting his new book, ""A Great Awakening is Coming!"" an ad for which appears to have aired on Fox News, and also focuses on this tale of Wilkerson’s prophecy. A video posted April 23 on a YouTube account called ""Mike Evans"" shows the ad airing during ""Fox and Friends.""  As a photograph of Wilkerson appears on screen, a narrator reads the same prophecy that is quoted in the Facebook post. ""Number one New York Times best-selling author Mike Evans has written an astonishing book on it called ‘A Great Awakening is Coming!’"" it continues. Then it directs viewers to get the book and the full prophecy by going to a website, where they can purchase the book in print, electronic form or in a set with DVDs selling for up to $56.90.  Wilkerson’s claims have faced scrutiny before. In 2009, Snopes.com debunked the claim that he was sent a message from God warning of the terrorist attacks in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001. Wilkerson had claimed to have been awoken from a dream weeks before planes crashed into the Twin Towers and told by God to prepare sandwiches. He claimed that he and other members of the Times Square Church made over 2,000 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. However, there was no evidence that the sandwiches were actually made prior to the attacks; they were actually made during the day on Sept. 11, after planes had already crashed into the Twin Towers.  A Facebook post from the Jerusalem Prayer team says Wilkerson warned Evans of a plague striking New York City, shutting down bars and restaurants and forcing people to shelter in their homes.  There is no evidence that Wilkerson said this, and his own church denies any instance of him saying this in a book or sermon. We rate the statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C01C600>],/factchecks/2020/apr/24/facebook-posts/no-pastor-david-wilkerson-did-not-predict-covid-19/
