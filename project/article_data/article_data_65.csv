Kucinich opposed the war early, but first?
","On the topic of the conflict in Iraq, Dennis Kucinich holds the high ground among his Democratic rivals who oppose the war with his 2002 vote against authorizing military action against Saddam Hussein. Of the Democrats running for president who were in Congress at the time, Kucinich is the only one who voted against the war resolution.
 
But to earn the crown as the ""first"" -- whatever that means, and Kucinich's campaign wouldn't clarify -- is a more nuanced privilege.
 
Was he the first person? No. Was he the first Congressman? No. Was he the first presidential candidate? No (Correct answer: Republican Ron Paul). Was he the first Democratic presidential candidate? Yes.
 
According to the Congressional Record, the Cleveland Democrat first spoke against the war in the context of Iraq in remarks made March 20, 2002. Kucinich advocated peace and warned against the slippery slope of nuclear weapons. (Paul spoke out on Nov. 29, 2001 saying ""the argument that (Saddam) Hussein is producing weapons of mass destruction is the reddest of all herrings,"" according to the Congressional Record.)
 
But Kucinich earned the title as the leader of the anti-war movement in late August 2002 after holding a widely reported Capitol Hill briefing where he called for more ""discussion about why we should not go to war,"" according to an article in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. He then began building a congressional coalition against the war.
 
""Unilateral military action by the United States against Iraq is unjustified, unwarranted and illegal,"" said Kucinich, according to The Washington Times on Sept. 20, 2002. ""The administration has failed to make the case that Iraq poses an imminent or immediate threat to the United States.""
 
Kucinich solidified his position as the opposition headmaster Oct. 3, 2002, when he took the floor of the House to present an eight-page, point-by-point analysis refuting the joint resolution on Iraq in the days before the vote.

Biden right: No fast way out.
","U.S. commanders say it would be a lengthy process, and independent military analysts have said it would take about a year to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq safely. It could be done faster, but with larger U.S. casualties and more abandoned equipment, experts say. McClatchy Newspapers has reported that a simulation conducted by the Pentagon since the debate suggested a retreat could take as little as six months, but critics said that estimate is overly optimistic.
""We must consider the complexity of the threat and deliberately reduce our forces based on the situation on the ground as well as the capability of the Iraqi security forces,"" Army Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, the deputy commander of forces in Iraq, said at a briefing this month. ""I think the plan will reflect that as we develop it.""

We would have accepted the results of a cerebral blood flow study or proof that Biden had examined Bush to see if he had an oculocephalic reflex.

McCain has been pretty consistent on Roe v. Wade
","The Roe v. Wade charge against John McCain seems to be the result of a verbal lapse eight years ago by the notably anti-abortion McCain. McCain had answered written questionnaires saying he opposed Roe v. Wade, but when the San Francisco Chronicle and CNN asked him about it in late 1999, McCain said, ""I'd love to see a point where it (the court ruling) is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short-term, or even the long-term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs. Wade, which would then force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations.""
 
McCain aides almost immediately started backpedaling from McCain's words, noting that McCain misspoke when he used the phrase ""even in the long term."" McCain said in an interview a few months later, ""I clearly misspoke there. I'm a person who's made mistakes in this campaign, and I'll continue to make mistakes. My voting record is clear, of 17 years of pro-life. I continue to hold that position, and I … continue to believe that Roe vs. Wade was a very flawed decision, as in the opinion of most experts.""
 
In South Carolina this year, McCain said, ""I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.""
 
We find McCain's brief remark of support falls short of a full-fledged change in position, so we rated Romney's claim Half True.

Correct, but he uses the most sensational estimate
","There's more than one source on these bank account figures and all of them are estimates.
 
But no matter the details, the point Edwards seeks to make is the same: Because they lack bank accounts, millions of poor must rely on expensive check-cashing services and payday loans.
 
The Edwards campaign Website uses the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank for its figure of about 56 million people without accounts. The center got the number from a 2002 report by the General Accounting Office, which used U.S. Census data to estimate that 55.9-million adults did not hold checking, savings or money market accounts in 1999.
 
But that number is at the high end of the available estimates. According to the Federal Reserve Board's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, its most recent, the number of American families without a bank account is closer to 10-million. The Census estimates 2.6 individuals per houshold, which would put the Federal Reserve estimate on bank accounts at 26-million at the very most because the Census household figure includes children.

McCain has come around to favor ethanol
","On ethanol, McCain has maintained a long-standing opposition to subsidies for the alternative fuel and that hasn't changed. But the way he talks about ethanol has changed significantly. In 1999, he told an audience in Iowa, where corn-based ethanol is popular: ""I'm here to tell you the things you don't want to hear as well as the things you want to hear. One of those things is ethanol. Ethanol is not worth it. It does not help the consumers. … Those ethanol subsidies should be phased out. And everybody here on this stage, if it wasn't for the fact that Iowa is the first caucus state, would share my view that we don't need ethanol subsidies.""
 
In 2007, McCain started to speak more favorably of ethanol and admitted it was a position change. He told Tim Russert on ""Meet the Press"": ""It makes a lot of sense. We are dependent on foreign oil too much. We have a situation where greenhouse gases has now become--emissions has become a vital issue. I am for sugarcane, biofuels, switch grass, and corn-based ethanol because of our need for independence on foreign oil. … I have adjusted to the realities of the world we live in today, and if I don't adjust to those realities, then I would be stuck in the past.""
 
That's a significant change in opinion on the biofuel. We found the statement that McCain used to oppose ethanol but now supports it to be Mostly True.

Thompson ignores contrary death penalty research
","The deterrent effect of execution on murders has long been debated, but Thompson suggests the matter has been resolved. Not so. Here is the full assertion from Thompson's broadcast on ABC radio June 27:
 
""...study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders. Some studies show really dramatic effects, with each execution of a murderer deterring as many as 18 or more murders. That's according to Emory University professors, who found as well that delaying execution also leads to further murders. Most studies have concluded that some number of murders between three and 18 are prevented for every application of capital punishment.""
 
A dozen research papers in the last six years support Thompson's assertion that capital punishment prevents murders, according to the Associated Press. Three studies get the most attention: a 2006 report by two economists and statistical papers in 2003 and 2006 from the Emory researchers.
 
The Law & Order star accurately quotes the Emory study, but his generalizations about ""most studies"" ignore significant contrary research.
 
A handful of studies directly challenge pro-deterrence findings by highlighting various missteps in methodology. ""These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims, standards such as replication and basic comparisons with other scenarios,"" said Jeffery Fagan of the Columbia Law School during testimony before a New York legislative panel.
 
Most notable is a paper by two National Bureau of Economic Research fellows who concluded ""that execution policy drives little of the year-to-year variation in homicide rates. As to whether executions rise or lower the homicide rate, we remain profoundly uncertain.""

If it quacks like a lobbyist, it's a lobbyist
","In his speeches and his TV ads, Barack Obama criticizes the influence of lobbyists.
 
""I know that I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington,"" he says in the television spot. ""But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.""
 
The announcer says, ""He's leading by example, refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists who have too much power today.""
 
But his anti-lobbyist policy includes one caveat and a few loopholes that weaken his claim to be funding his political campaign in a way that's truly different from his competitors.
 
He almost always qualifies his statement to note that he won't take money from federal lobbyists, a distinction that allows him to accept money from well-connected state lobbyists.
 
For example, South Florida lobbyist Russ Klenet and his wife will host a fundraising event in Broward County for Obama on August 25. Klenet represents state groups such as the Florida Association of Mortgage Brokers, but also companies such as Match.com and Election Systems & Software.
 
And Obama still accepts tens of thousands of dollars from people who work for Washington firms that do substantial lobbying. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is an Obama contributor who isn't a registered lobbyist, but works as a consultant for Alston & Bird, a lobbying firm in Washington.
 
The Center for Responsive Politics found that Obama accepted $55,019 from employees at lobbying firms, and much more from companies that are not classified as lobbying firms but have lobbying divisions.
 
So we give Obama's statement a Half-True on the Truth-O-Meter. While Obama can accurately say that he does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists, he still accepts thousands from people in the influence industry.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Tom Price']","
In bid to restructure Medicaid, does Rep. Tom Price get conclusions of an academic paper right?
","When Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, released his committee’s 2017 budget resolution, he posted the text on Medium. Part of the budget takes a jab at the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. The committee proposes to restructure Medicaid, the federal-state program for health coverage for the poor. The resolution urges repealing the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and ""giving states more power to control their Medicaid dollars."" But one passage caught our eye: ""For too many Americans, Medicaid is an empty promise. Finding a physician who will see Medicaid beneficiaries can be incredibly challenging because providers are under-reimbursed and cannot afford to provide care at the rates the program pays. In fact, a study conducted by a team of renowned economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Dartmouth concluded that Medicaid’s value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program."" We wondered whether Price and his committee were correct to cite the work of three health care academics to support the argument that Medicaid is ""an empty promise"" that provides ""significantly lower"" value to its beneficiaries than its actual cost. As it turns out, it’s more complicated than that. In fact, one of the paper’s co-authors told PolitiFact that he disputed the connection the committee was seeking to draw. About the paper We started our research by locating the paper, written by Amy Finkelstein of MIT, Nathaniel Hendren of Harvard and Erzo F.P. Luttmer of Dartmouth and published in June 2015. Titled, ""The Value Of Medicaid: Interpreting Results from The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment,"" it looked at data from Oregon’s 2008 expansion of its Medicaid rolls. Oregon’s Medicaid program provided a unique opportunity for researchers, because the state had only enough funding to cover a portion of residents who wanted to sign up. So to distribute spots in the program, they set up a lottery. This allowed health care economists a rare opportunity to compare health-related outcomes for those with Medicaid as well as an uninsured control group. (We have previously written about a different study that uses the Oregon data.) The paper is aimed at hard-core health care wonks, but the gist of the authors’ mission was to determine how much of every Medicaid dollar benefited recipients directly, as opposed to how much benefited the wallets of whoever else would have been paying the health care bills if the person was not covered by Medicaid. Ultimately, the authors estimated that between 40 and 80 cents of every dollar benefitted whoever would have been paying those health care costs if Medicaid hadn’t been. These could be state or local governments, the patient’s relatives or friends, or health care providers who would otherwise have to eat the unreimbursed costs of care. (Between 20 and 40 cents of every dollar replaced money that Medicaid recipients would have spent on their own.) When the study came out, some supporters of a more free-market approach to health care touted it as evidence that Medicaid wasn’t doing a good job of targeting its dollars. And if true, this would be an argument for cutting the program or making significant changes to it. The authors respond However, it’s important to remember that all the money being studied in the paper -- even that which reimbursed someone other than the patient themself -- was spent on behalf of the patient. The patient reaped the benefits of the full dollar, not just 20 to 40 cents of it. That means ""Medicaid’s value to its beneficiaries,"" as the resolution put it, isn’t just the 20 to 40 cents that replaces the Medicaid beneficiary’s personal outlays; rather, it’s something approaching the whole dollar. In addition, the study doesn’t exactly speak to whether Medicaid is an ""empty promise,"" as the resolution puts it, or to such issues as doctor shortages or below-market reimbursement rates. When we ran the passage from the budget resolution by the authors of the paper, Hendren told us that what the committee said amounted to ""a non sequitur."" ""We don’t provide any evidence in our paper suggesting providers are under-reimbursed or that individuals on Medicaid aren’t able to obtain care,"" he said, adding, ""the result is more nuanced than the way it is referenced."" When we contacted Price’s staff, they said they didn’t mean to suggest that the academics had endorsed their specific reform effort. They added that the committee still believes the paper offers a concrete example of how the program is falling short on its promise to beneficiaries. ""It is failing to deliver on that promise for too many right now, and we simply cite the research from MIT, Harvard and Dartmouth as one example of how it is failing,"" the committee told PolitiFact. But when we ran that response by Hendren, he was skeptical. ""I would disagree that we present evidence that Medicaid is ‘failing’ its beneficiaries,"" Hendren said. ""Our results suggest the common interpretation of Medicaid — namely that its primary beneficiaries are the enrollees themselves — is misguided. If I give one dollar to you and one dollar to your boss, you’d probably only be willing to pay one dollar for that. Just because the program costs two dollars doesn’t mean it’s failing, in my opinion. Rather, we’d want to also think about the fact that the program is benefiting your boss, too."" Our ruling Price, in his committee’s resolution, said that ""for too many Americans, Medicaid is an empty promise. … In fact, a study conducted by a team of renowned economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Dartmouth concluded that Medicaid’s value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program."" Academics did conclude that only a fraction of what Medicaid spends directly replaces what its beneficiaries would have had to pay for their health care costs. But even the Medicaid money that doesn’t replace the beneficiary’s own spending does pay for their health care. This conflicts with the resolution’s claim that the paper showed that Medicaid’s ""value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program."" The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/08/tom-price/bid-restructure-medciaid-does-rep-tom-price-get-co/

N.C. Sen. Phil Berger says A.G. Roy Cooper is failing his duties by not defending HB2 lawsuit
","N.C. Attorney General Roy Cooper took flak from many conservatives when he announced that he would not defend a controversial new state law, commonly called HB2, in court. The law says only biological gender, and not gender identity, can determine which bathroom someone may use. It also created a statewide anti-discrimination law that doesn’t include protections for gay or transgender people. The ACLU, Equality NC and several transgender or gay people who say it discriminates against them have filed a lawsuit. Cooper is named as a defendant, as are Gov. Pat McCrory, the UNC System, its board of governors and the board of governors chairman, W. Louis Bissette Jr. Republicans, including Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, have accused Cooper of playing politics by telling the legislature to repeal the law or hire outside counsel to defend it. Cooper is the Democratic candidate for governor in this fall’s election. ""Attorney General Roy Cooper refuses to do his job and defend us,"" Berger wrote in a Facebook post. ""This isn't the first time Cooper has pandered to far-left special interests instead of fulfilling his oath to defend the people of North Carolina. Please join me and call on Roy Cooper to resign immediately, for refusing to do his job and protect our children."" We already looked at claims in the HB2 debate about safety and protecting people from sex crimes. Chris Sgro of Equality NC said sexual predators have not used transgender anti-discrimination laws as cover to sneak into women’s bathrooms and commit crimes. We rated that claim Mostly True. But what about the crux of Berger’s call for Cooper to resign? Is the attorney general refusing to do his job here? ""It’s clear I’m doing my job in this case,"" Cooper told a reporter at the news conference when he announced his decision in late March. Clearly Cooper and Berger disagree on the responsibilities of the attorney general. But that’s understandable – it’s a question that has kept legal scholars busy for years. First, let’s look at what state law says. Duties of the job The N.C. Attorney General has no constitutional duties. The office’s duties have instead been pieced together over the years by common law, court rulings and state statutes. The main source is General Statute chapter 114, which lays out eight duties of the office. One is to represent the state ""in any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in which the state may be a party or interested."" The N.C. Supreme Court reaffirmed that duty in a 1987 case. And just a few years ago, Cooper cited this duty in explaining why he would defend the state’s voter ID law despite his own opinion about it. ""It is the duty under the law for this office to defend the state when it gets sued — even if I personally disagree with the public policy,"" Cooper said in a 2013 Los Angeles Times interview. ""This office is going to follow the law."" That appears at first to contradict what Cooper is saying now. The HB2 case, however, is different in two key ways. Cooper simply said he disagreed with the voter ID law. But he is calling HB2 unconstitutional. Furthermore, two state agencies – including his own – are challenging the law. Cooper has said he will represent them instead. That brings into consideration another duty of the job, to represent state ""departments, agencies, institutions, commissions, bureaus or other organized activities"" in legal issues. Legal precedent So what happens when a legal battle involves state government on both sides, as with HB2? This isn’t the first time it has happened under Cooper. In 2014, McCrory sued the General Assembly, saying it acted unconstitutionally in appointing members of an environmental committee. Cooper defended the legislature. McCrory hired private lawyers and recently won at the N.C. Supreme Court. This time, however, Cooper says he won’t defend the state, since his own office and the N.C. Treasurer’s office are calling the law unconstitutional. ""This case presents the attorney general with a direct conflict – whether to argue the constitutionality of these executive branch policies and the rights of these employees or the constitutionality of HB2,"" said Cooper’s deputy campaign manager, Megan Jacobs. Scholarly opinions Berger’s office strongly disagrees with the argument that HB2 is unconstitutional, however. ""Lawyers will always claim gray areas and make legalistic excuses,"" said Amy Auth, Berger’s deputy chief of staff. She said defending the state is foremost among Cooper’s duties and called his argument ""a make-believe legal conflict to prop up his refusal to defend state law."" However, constitutional law professor Gregory Wallace of Campbell University School of Law said the issue is more nuanced. State law doesn’t give any exceptions to the office’s duties, Wallace said, ""but many scholars and attorneys have recognized certain implicit exceptions to the duty to defend at both the federal and state level­."" Wallace said Cooper could be impeached for acting outside the scope of his duties, but also that his oath to uphold the constitution would arguably give him a valid excuse not to defend a law that he believes is unconstitutional. These types of questions are fairly new, and ambiguous. Last year the Yale Law Journal published a study whose title shows the complexity of the issue: ""Fifty States, Fifty Attorneys General, and Fifty Approaches to the Duty To Defend."" It found that these types of squabbles were almost unheard of before 2008 but have increased significantly since then. It argued that attorneys general can choose not to defend some laws. ""With Democrats and Republicans squarely divided on issues like same-sex marriage, gun control, and campaign finance, we predict that attorneys general will increasingly seek political advantage by refusing to defend (or insisting on the defense of) laws that divide the parties,"" the law professors behind the article wrote. In 2009 the National Association of Attorneys General asked Jim Tierney – a law professor, former Maine attorney general and expert on the office – to lead a discussion about whether attorneys general should defend the constitutionality of laws and actions they believe to be unconstitutional. ""Basically, when is it okay for an attorney general to lie to the public?"" Tierney asked the crowd at the meeting. He later answered his own question: ""The courts generally support broad discretion for attorneys general … stating that the real client of the attorney general is the people of the state."" Nearly 30 years ago, former N.C. Attorney General Lacy Thornburg made a similar argument in a law review article, writing that the office's chief duty is to the people, not the government. Wallace, the constitutional law professor, said he thinks an attorney general must believe in good faith that a law is unconstitutional in order not to defend it. ""By a ‘good faith’ belief in the law’s unconstitutionality, I do not mean mere disagreement with the law because it’s bad policy in the AG’s view or because recusing would give the AG a political advantage in an upcoming political campaign,"" Wallace said. Our ruling Berger said that by not defending HB2 in court, Cooper ""refuses to do his job"" as attorney general. State law does say Cooper's job includes the duty to to defend the state in court. However, that’s not the end of the debate. Cooper has other possibly conflicting duties. And legal scholars tend to side with Cooper's argument that attorneys general don’t always have to defend laws – especially ones they believe to be unconstitutional. However, the issue is a new one in North Carolina, and the law is still relatively unsettled. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/07/phil-berger/nc-sen-phil-berger-says-g-roy-cooper-failing-his-d/

Did Hillary Clinton say Bernie Sanders 'not qualified' to be president? Not directly
","Presidential candidates spend a lot of time explaining why they are the best qualified for the job. But now a brouhaha has broken out between Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders over whether the other is qualified at all. During an April 6 rally at Temple University in Philadelphia, Sanders contended that in the wake of Clinton's loss in Wisconsin, she is getting a little nervous. ""And she has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, 'not qualified to be president,’ "" he told the crowd. Sanders then said, ""I don't believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds. I don't think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your Super PAC. I don't think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq. I don't think you are qualified if you've supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement, which has cost us millions of decent-paying jobs."" In fact, both candidates are clearly qualified in the strictest sense, because they both meet the four constitutional requirements to be president: age 35 or older, a natural born citizen, a resident for at least 14 years, and neither are finishing a second term in the job. So is Sanders correct that Clinton has been saying the he was ""not qualified to be president""? We emailed his campaign asking where to find Clinton specifically and directly making that statement. The campaign couldn't. Instead, the Sanders people sent us video of a Sanders news conference in which he cites a CNN report saying that the Clinton campaign's strategy would be to ""Disqualify (Sanders), defeat him and unify the party later."" But that's not a quote from Clinton. It's a summation by CNN's senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny, who begins his article this way: ""Hillary Clinton's campaign is taking new steps to try and disqualify Bernie Sanders in the eyes of Democratic voters."" The article says Clinton spokeswoman Christina Reynolds argued that Sanders is unqualified, but Reynolds is not directly quoted as saying that. Instead, she is quoted as saying, ""You get the impression Sen. Sanders hasn't thought very much"" about how to actually get goals accomplished. Sanders also cited a April 6 Washington Post headline: ""Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president."" That headline comes from a story based on an April 6 interview with Clinton on the MSNBC show Morning Joe, in which host Joe Scarborough repeatedly tried to get Clinton to say whether she believed Sanders is ""qualified and ready"" to be president. In each case, Clinton wouldn't answer directly. Initially, Clinton said Sanders' interview with the New York Daily News ""raised a lot of really serious questions."" In the interview, Sanders seemed to stumble over details about how he would implement some of his proposals, such as breaking up big banks. ""So is he qualified?"" Scarborough said, asking if she thought Sanders was ""ready to be president."" Clinton said she thought Sanders hadn't done his homework and ""that does raise a lot of questions."" Scarborough tried again, asking ""But do you think he is qualified?"" Again, Clinton didn't give a yes or no answer.

 No, Bernie Sanders didn't retroactively win Nevada
","Hillary Clinton was declared the winner of Nevada’s presidential caucuses back in February, but some supporters of Bernie Sanders are claiming the Vermont senator might have won the state after all. The pronouncement came after Sanders delegates ended up outnumbering Clinton’s during the hectic Clark County Democratic Convention on April 2, leading many media outlets and supporters to declare that Sanders retroactively ""won"" the state by outmaneuvering Clinton. So, did Sanders add another state to his column as many have claimed? The answer is no, and it likely will remain that way. We’ll tell you why. Caucus math Nevada has a total of 43 delegates it sends to the Democratic National Convention in July. Eight of those are so-called ""superdelegates,"" made up of elected officials like Sen. Harry Reid and other party powerhouses who get to independently decide which candidate to support. (Four currently support Clinton, one supports Sanders and three are neutral so far.) Of the remaining 35 delegates, 23 are so-called ""district-level delegates"" who are allocated based on February caucus results in each of the state’s four congressional districts. Clinton won 13 of those, while Sanders won 10. The remaining 12 are doled out during the state party convention in May. Of that 12, there are five pledged ""party leader and elected official"" delegates and seven ""at-large"" delegates awarded proportionally, so whichever campaign has a majority of supporters at the state convention will win the odd-numbered delegate from those groups. Ideally, the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll — smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process, but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus. Initial estimates from February had Clinton winning 20 delegates and Sanders taking 15. But that didn’t happen at the Clark County (Las Vegas) convention in early April, as the Sanders campaign had 2,964 delegates show up compared to 2,386 for Clinton. In February, Clinton won a total of 4,889 delegates in Clark County but less than half of those showed up for the county convention. Accusations flew from both campaigns about questionable practices before, during and after the county convention, with the Sanders campaign claiming party officials tried to ""depose a neutral official,"" and Clinton surrogates like Nevada state director Michelle White upset with a ""number of irregularities"" in the convention process. Leaving those accusations aside for the moment, the practical outcome is that Sanders now has a larger number of delegates (2,124) attending the state convention in May than Clinton (1,722). That means they’ll be in a position to pick off a few of those remaining 12 convention delegates. Based on the numbers, it’s likely that Sanders will be able to flip delegates and go from a projected 20-15 deficit to a more narrow 18-17 delegate split. (This count doesn’t factor in the superdelegates, who are also tilted toward Clinton.) For Sanders, that’s not ""winning"" Nevada. Longtime Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston and the Associated Press reported in the immediate aftermath of the county convention that the likely final result remains a Clinton victory. ""Clinton’s widely expected to keep her Nevada win except in the unlikely event of a Sanders blowout at the state level or if Clinton-backing superdelegates defect to the Sanders camp,"" the AP reported. Our ruling Several reports claimed that Bernie Sanders retroactively won Nevada’s presidential caucuses, based on higher-than-expected turnout at a major county convention. Sanders likely swung two delegates his way after the county convention, but we won’t know for sure until the state convention selects the delegates in May. Either way, Clinton still holds a narrow delegate lead, projections show. That lead is larger if you include the support of Nevada’s so-called ""super-delegates.""

Which happens more: People struck by lightning or people committing voter fraud by impersonation?
","In a blog post one month before Wisconsin’s presidential primary election -- which was a test for the state’s photo ID law -- U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan called for making it easier to vote in the Badger State. But the Madison-area Democrat’s post on Medium, an online publishing platform for sharing information and viewpoints, started by making a claim about voter fraud that we want to check. ""First, we need to accept the fact that in-person voter fraud by impersonation is virtually non-existent, with only 10 cases proven nationally out of 1 billion ballots cast since 2000,"" Pocan, who opposes Wisconsin’s newly reinstated photo ID law, wrote in the March 7, 2016 post. ""Let’s put it this way, more people are struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud."" Getting struck by lightning might actually be more common than what you’d guess. What about in-person voter fraud by impersonation -- that is, claiming to be someone else as you cast your ballot? We’ll note up front that there are various types of voter fraud, but Pocan is citing one particular type. Photo ID laws controversial Laws requiring citizens to show photo identification in order to vote have long been controversial across the country, including in Wisconsin. They are praised as a way to prevent fraud and criticized as being a barrier for some citizens, including college students and those who don’t have a valid drivers license. But when GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said in June 2015 that most Americans support voter ID laws, we rated his statement Mostly True. Polls showed strong support for voter ID laws, including from Democrats. Walker signed Wisconsin’s voter ID law in 2011, but the requirement was in place for only the spring 2012 primary election before being blocked by court challenges. Those eventually failed and the requirement was reinstated. The April 2016 primary was the first high-turnout election since the reinstatement. Similar claim A claim similar to Pocan’s was made in August 2015, days after Texas’ voter ID law was ruled unconstitutional by a federal appeals court. ""You’re more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas"" than find in-person voter fraud, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said in a national television interview. PolitiFact National rated Booker’s statement, which Booker said was about voter fraud by impersonation, as True. The probability of being struck by lightning in Texas was 1 in 1.35 million. Based on the number of in-person voter fraud cases identified in Texas versus the number of ballots cast, those odds were lower -- 1 in 18 million. Pocan’s claim is somewhat different -- it is about actual numbers, not odds, and is national in scope. Lightning strikes The National Weather Service tracks lightning strikes. The most recent figures -- in terms of injuries as well as deaths caused by lightning strikes -- cover the 10-year period from 2004 through 2013. On average, the number of deaths and injuries reported each year was 267 -- 33 deaths, plus 234 injuries. The weather service believes that total figure is higher, however, because some injuries from lightning strikes are not reported. It estimates that the total number of casualties per year is actually 330 -- 33 deaths plus 297 injuries. Documented cases of voter fraud by impersonation are far fewer. Voter fraud Election administration expert Justin Levitt, who has been tracking allegations of voter fraud since 2000, most recently wrote on the topic in the Washington Post in August 2014. Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said in the piece that dating back to 2000 he found around the country 31 ""credible allegations of potential fraud that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls"" -- that is, possible fraud involving impersonation.   Other election experts, including Lorraine Minnite of Rutgers University, also have used the lightning strike comparison. It’s fair to say, however, that impersonation cases can be hard to count in that they are hard to prove -- particularly when no photo ID requirement is in place and a voter can cast a ballot simply by stating the name of a registered voter. So the number of cases of in-person fraud by impersonation may be higher than that cited by Levitt, but no independent source suggests it is higher than the number of lightning strikes. Our rating Pocan said: ""More people are struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud"" by impersonation. Roughly 300 people per year are struck by lightning in the United States. But cases of voter fraud -- someone impersonating another voter -- are documented even less often. We rate Pocan’s statement True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/07/mark-pocan/which-happens-more-people-struck-lightning-or-peop/

Does the economy always do better under Democratic presidents?
","Hillary Clinton talked big about the economy, including raising the minimum wage and equal pay for women, at a rally ahead of Arizona’s Presidential Preference Election. ""The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House,"" Clinton said March 21 at Carl Hayden Community High School in Phoenix. The Clinton family love these comparisons, by the way. In 2015, PolitiFact ruled Mostly True claims from Hillary Clinton a claim that ,""Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats,"" and another that, ""The stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House."" At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton had this statement rated True: ""Since 1961 … our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)."" The score, however, isn’t as good for this particular Clinton claim. Other factors involved Clinton’s Arizona spokesman, Tim Hogan, pointed us to a July 2014 study on the topic from Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. The study concludes that Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947, when the data was first tracked. However, the economists point out that there are other factors, such as better oil prices and international conditions, that could be driving these better numbers for Democratic presidents. In short, Democrats occupying the Oval Office tend to have a little better luck. Experts we spoke with largely held the same views. Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the statistics, from GDP to the unemployment rate, are striking, but noted that the president does not have ""all that control.""  ""That doesn’t prove what the cause is,"" Frankel said. (Update: After this item published, we heard from Frankel who said he believed Clinton's statement was accurate because Clinton did not say that Democrats caused the gap in performance. You can read more on his views here.) Robert Shapiro, chairman of Washington D.C. economic advisory firm Sonecon, said Clinton is right, but with the same caveat. ""The details, of course, depend on how and what you compare, since the economy performs better in certain periods than others,"" Shapiro said. Christian Weller, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, did his own math on the GDP data since 1947. He found that the economy, through the last quarter of 2015 and after inflation, grew 3.8 percent under Democrats and 2.4 percent under Republicans. For President Barack Obama, the growth rate in his first term was 1.8 percent. His current growth rate is 2 percent, but that’s still higher than his predecessor, George W. Bush. And his second term hasn’t ended yet. Based on estimates, Weller said Obama should hit the 2.4 percent Republican average. Still, Ronald Reagan’s 3.4 percent growth rate is well ahead of the economy right now under Obama. ""Other than Obama, every Democrat had a faster growth rate, even (Jimmy) Carter had a slightly higher growth rate than Reagan,"" Weller said. ""This is one of the safest talking points for a Democratic contender."" However, the asterisks bother Arizona State University presidential historian Brooks Simpson. ""Secretary Clinton is not exactly telling the whole truth,’"" Simpson said. Simpson referenced Bill Clinton’s administration, noting that he benefited from some of the economic policies of his predecessor, Republican George H.W. Bush. A 2011 report from the right-leaning Heritage Foundation notes that the economy was already in its ""22nd month of expansion"" when Bill Clinton took office in January 1993. Our ruling Hillary Clinton said, ""the economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House."" Yes, Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947. But Clinton's comments require several caveats. The current growth in the economy under Obama is lower than the Republican average. Factors such as oil prices also reflect the higher GDP growth under Democratic presidents. On top of that, comparing one period of time to another or one president to another can be problematic. On balance, we rate Clinton's claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5799cbf2-451d-4bea-bb10-cd4dd1203e8b",/factchecks/2016/apr/06/hillary-clinton/does-economy-always-do-better-under-democratic-pre/

Did Gov. Rick Scott really cut access to women's health care, as Starbucks woman says?
","When Gov. Rick Scott walked into a Starbucks in downtown Gainesville, he got an earful from a woman who attacked his positions on health care. A video of the woman yelling at Scott for about a minute drew more than 259,000 hits on YouTube in about 24 hours and was shown on national television the next day. ""You cut Medicaid so I couldn’t get Obamacare,"" yelled the woman, Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner who is now a stay-at-home mother. ""You are an a------! You don’t care about working people. ... You should be ashamed to show your face around here."" Scott countered by saying, ""We’ve got a million jobs."" ""A million jobs? Great. Who here has a great job or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?"" Jennings said. ""You stripped women of access to public health care. Shame on you, Rick Scott! We depend on those services."" In this fact-check we will explain whether Scott ""stripped women of access to public health care."" Jennings is referencing a law Scott signed in March that pertains to clinics that provide abortions. (Here is our fact-check about her comments on Medicaid, an issue on which we gave Scott a Full Flop for changing his position on Medicaid expansion in 2015. We also checked Scott's claim about 1 million jobs.) Scott’s action related to public health care The Palm Beach Post in 2010 described Jennings, then a city commissioner, as an advocate for the poor, illegal immigrants and homeless. We could not reach Jennings for comment. She told the Palm Beach Post and ABC Action News in Tampa that she had been reading about Scott signing a bill that cuts money for Planned Parenthood. Here's what Jennings had to say on Facebook: ""I am upset about the awful bill Governor Scott signed last week - cuts funding to Planned Parenthood and restricts abortion access. Just last night I looked online to see if there is a march planned to defend our rights to abortion. And then today, the Governor walked into the coffee shop I was at.....and left with no coffee. (video credit to the stranger who recorded the scene)."" On March 25, Scott signed a bill that removes state funding from any clinic that does abortions. HB 1411 passed the House 76-40 and the Senate 25-15, and it takes effect July 1. A key provision in the law is that it prohibits public funding for an organization that owns, operates or is affiliated with a licensed abortion clinic. The law includes several requirements for abortion clinics, including annual licensure inspections, and prohibits selling or transferring fetal remains. In 2014, there were 72,073 abortions performed in Florida. Federal funding is already banned for abortions due to the federal Hyde Amendment, which includes limited exceptions. Florida’s Medicaid program will cover an abortion if needed to save the life of the mother or if she got pregnant as a result of rape or incest. Those exceptions continue under the new law. Planned Parenthood serves about 5,500 Florida patients through Title X, a family-planning program that it provides through a state contract, and about another 2,000 more people through Medicaid in Florida. The state Department of Health spent about $139,000 for the Title X services provided by Planned Parenthood in 2014-15 and expected to spend about $163,000 in 2015-16. The Florida Medicaid program paid about $106,000 in claims to Planned Parenthood in 2014-15, according to staff analysis of the bill. Planned Parenthood offers many types of services beyond abortion, including birth control, STD testing and cervical cancer screening. These are the types of services that state dollars supported. So how much will Planned Parenthood lose in annual funding? We heard figures ranging from $114,000 from Scott’s office to $500,000 from Planned Parenthood. Scott’s office argued that the funding cut is small compared to the overall state dollars given to clinics. ""Over $5 million in state funds are provided for non-abortion services at many charitable clinics and county health departments,"" according to a March 30 statement by Scott. ""HB 1411 makes sure no state funds can indirectly fund abortions by supporting the same institutions that perform them. For Planned Parenthood, this would only affect about $114,000 in funds they get annually."" Family planning services remain funded at various clinics and centers that don’t provide abortions, including all 67 county health departments. So Jennings exaggerated when she said that Scott ""stripped women of access to public health care"" because access to certain types of health care remain available. The Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates issued its own statement that Scott was low-balling the amount of money clinics could lose. Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, told PolitiFact Florida that she expects the total loss of money to be closer to $500,000. In a news release, Planned Parenthood said Scott was downplaying the effects ""of patients losing access to care by only sharing the state funds that would be prohibited under this legislation. However, because the legislation is broadly written, Planned Parenthood will also lose access to reimbursements from local government entities and federal funding from the Title X program that is contracted through local county Health Departments."" Planned Parenthood arrived at a potential figure of losing $500,000 based on $50,000 for Medicaid, $147,000 for Title X, and then funding for specific services or counties -- the largest chunk in Palm Beach. The two Planned Parenthood affiliates each had a budget of about $11 million last year. Planned Parenthood is determining whether it can find alternate sources of funding, so it couldn’t yet say how many fewer patients may be served. Also, 70 percent of Planned Parenthood centers are located in medically underserved areas, which means that sometimes they are ""the only place where people can receive publicly funded family planning services,"" according to Planned Parenthood. Critics of Florida’s new law say similar provisions in Texas led about 20 clinics to shut down. Critics of the Texas law argued that it was unconstitutional before the U.S. Supreme Court in March. A spokesman for the ACLU of Florida said that it is analyzing the impact of the law but it hasn’t announced any decision about whether it will challenge it in court. Supporters of the bill, such as John Stemberger of the Florida Family Policy Council, argued that it will protect women. The federal government has warned state officials that the bill may place Florida out of compliance with federal Medicaid law that bans states from restricting individuals from accessing care from any qualified provider. But it’s unlikely federal officials will consider action until the law goes into effect July 1. Our ruling The Starbucks activist said Scott ""stripped women of access to public health care."" Scott signed a law this year that cuts off state funding for any clinic that provides abortions, including Planned Parenthood. We heard estimates that it will cut anywhere from $114,000 to $500,000 for Planned Parenthood, which provides other health services to low-income women. It’s possible to wrongly assume from Jennings’ statement that Scott slashed women’s health care services broadly across the state. The cut targets abortion clinics, so it isn’t a cut for health care offices that don’t provide the procedure, such as county health departments. There is some truth to the statement, but it’s too soon to tell exactly how the law will curtail women’s access to publicly supported health care.

Starbucks woman claims Rick Scott cut Medicaid, preventing her from getting Obamacare
","It starts like a joke — Gov. Rick Scott walks into a Gainesville Starbucks — but one patron wasn’t laughing. In town on April 5, 2016, to tour the recently opened factory and headquarters for biopharmaceutical company Nanotherapeutics, Scott stopped in to the coffee chain for a cup. Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner, saw Scott and ripped into him from her seat. Among other grievances, she accused him of denying her health care coverage with his policies. ""In fact, you cut Medicaid so I couldn’t get Obamacare,"" Jennings shouted on April 5, 2016. ""You are an a------! You don’t care about working people. You don’t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here."" When Scott countered that the state had created a million jobs since the recession, she said no one cared (read our fact-check on those jobs numbers). She then criticized his March signing of a bill denying funding for women’s health care clinics that performed abortions (read our check about that issue). We tried to reach Jennings by phone, text, email and even Facebook, but we didn’t hear back from her, so we don’t really know the specifics of her situation. That makes it difficult to gauge whether she was able to benefit from the health care law. But we can look at whether Scott cut Medicaid, the joint state and federal program to provide health insurance for the very poor, in a way that could have denied people health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. It’s not so much that he cut anything, but more that he hasn’t consistently supported expanding the program. That has indeed left hundreds of thousands of Floridians without coverage. The expansion debate  Jennings told ABC Action News in Tampa after the incident that she is a single mother who worked part-time. That provides clues that she may fall into what is known as the Medicaid coverage gap. To understand why, let’s review how the Affordable Care Act is linked to Medicaid. The law originally wanted to cover uninsured people two different ways. One was to subsidize people who needed help buying insurance through state marketplaces or HealthCare.gov. The second was to expand Medicaid to cover a higher number of poorer people. Normally, to be eligible for Medicaid, your annual income has to be 44 percent of the federal poverty level (100 percent is currently $11,880 for an individual and $24,300 for a family of four). The plan was to extend that eligibility to all adults up to 138 percent of the poverty level. Technically the calculation under the law is 133 percent, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that. But Medicaid expansion ended up being optional after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling saying it could not be forced upon states. Currently 19 states, including Florida, have chosen not to grow the program. Recent estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 948,000 uninsured adults in Florida would be covered by an expansion. This has led to plenty of debate among lawmakers, including a meltdown during the 2015 Florida legislative session over how to cover more lower-income residents. The Senate was open to a limited expansion, while the House opposed it altogether. But now the math really starts to get tricky. If a state doesn’t expand Medicaid, people who make 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level can get marketplace subsidies to buy private insurance. Because of the way the law was written, that leaves people making between 44 and 100 percent of the poverty level out in the cold, without assistance. Those people don’t qualify for Medicaid, and can’t get subsidies to buy insurance. That’s the so-called coverage gap. According to Kaiser, there are 567,000 people under that umbrella in the Sunshine State. Chances are good that a single mother working part time could fit into that definition. Scott, a former hospital chain executive best known for resigning amid controversy over his company defrauding Medicare, has had a spotty history with Medicaid. He initially opposed expanding the program under Obamacare, then supported it during his re-election campaign, then went back to opposing it. We rated his position a Full Flop. While the Legislature is the body that would have to approve an expansion, Scott’s opinion affects the debate. (Scott’s office did not respond to our questions about Medicaid.) He has argued with Washington over the federal government ending payments for low-income hospital patients, leaving the Legislature to use state money to plug holes in the program the last two years. Scott has also asked lawmakers to eliminate automatic increases to Medicaid hospital rates. He’s also overseen the state’s controversial transition to managed care, in which private companies took over Medicaid policies as a cost-cutting measure. Florida CHAIN, a consumer health advocacy group, told us managed care organizations had actually seen a boost in funding. And there’s the aforementioned abortion bill Scott signed on March 25. That bill prevents state and Medicaid money from going to clinics that perform elective abortions, including Planned Parenthood affiliates. But these are specific issues not necessarily related to getting access to broad health care coverage under Obamacare. While many Floridians remain uninsured without Medicaid expansion, we found no evidence of an outright cut, as Jennings said. Our ruling The activist at Starbucks said Rick Scott ""cut Medicaid"" so people can't ""get Obamacare."" Her point-blank accusation that Scott cut the program doesn’t fit. But through Scott’s inaction and the Florida House's resistance to expansion, many Floridians are not benefitting from either subsidies to buy private insurance or an expanded Medicaid.   The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Facebook post exaggerates discrepancy between US men's and women's soccer teams
","Despite bringing in more money than their male counterparts, the U.S. women’s national soccer team is paid a lot less, according to a claim spreading around social media. ""Five All-Star Women’s World Cup Champions just sued the U.S. Soccer Federation for pay equity,"" reads an image posted on Facebook by The Other 98 Percent, a liberal advocacy group. ""Last year, they generated $20 (million) more than the men’s team and were paid almost four times less."" Five members of the U.S. women’s national soccer team, the reigning world champions, have indeed filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that deals with employment discrimination, claiming the U.S. Soccer Federation pays them less than members on the male team. This comes amid a dispute between U.S. Soccer and the women’s team over their collective bargaining agreement. The Other 98 Percent’s claim — that the women’s soccer team made $20 million more for U.S. Soccer than the men yet were paid four times less — comes from news reports about the equal pay complaint, filed by players Carli Lloyd, Hope Solo, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Becky Sauerbrunn. The complaint itself does not claim either of these figures. Instead, it says more generally that the women’s team has generated significant revenue and that women’s national team members ""have been paid and continue to be paid substantially less than (men’s national team) players."" So we wanted to see if these numbers in The Other 98 Percent’s graphic add up. Revenue While the women’s team is projected to have brought in more revenue than the men’s team for the 2016 fiscal year, it’s not nearly as large a gap as The Other 98 Percent’s image claims. Last year, U.S. Soccer projected the men’s and women’s teams together would bring in about $24 million, and they ended up taking in about double that amount, according to financial documents released by the federation earlier this year. The women’s team brought in slightly more of that revenue: $26.8 million, including $3.2 million in World Cup revenue. The men brought in revenues totaling $21 million. But that’s a difference of about $5.8 million, nowhere close to the $20 million cited in the graphic. (It’s worth noting that expenses exceeded revenue for the women’s World Cup, so that particular event resulted in net losses rather than profit for U.S. Soccer.) In its report, the federation cited both teams’ successes in contributing to the budget-busting revenue, but it singled out the women’s team for its World Cup win and the nine-game victory tour that followed. For the upcoming year, the federation predicts the women’s team will bring in about $17.6 million in revenue, resulting in a net profit. The men’s team, on the other hand, is expected to bring in about half of that, $9 million, and end up with net losses. While the women’s team championship win was a leading factor in raising U.S. Soccer revenue beyond expectations, they brought in about $5.8 million more than the men’s team, not $20 million. Compensation The women’s team players’ complaint against U.S. Soccer highlights some perceived disparities in pay. But there’s no way to easily compare the women with the men because their compensation agreements are drastically different. For example, women earn a $72,000 base salary and benefits like health insurance, while men are paid on a per-game basis and do not receive a salary or benefits. But here are a few of the examples that the complaint raises: Both teams play 20 exhibition games each year. Female players earn $1,350 for winning an exhibition game, while male players win $5,000 if they lose and up to $17,625 if they win, depending on the opponent’s ranking. For making the World Cup roster, female players earned $15,000 each, while male players made $68,750 each in their World Cup year. For winning the World Cup, the women earned $2 million to split among the players. For losing in the round of 16, the men earned $9 million. (This bonus is determined by FIFA, the international soccer governing body, not U.S. Soccer.) When traveling, the men’s team receives approximately 25 percent more per diem cash than the women’s team. Players earn a bonus per ticket sold at their games. For women, that bonus is $1.20 per ticket, while it is $1.50 per ticket for the men. As to whether all of this amounts to women players earning one-fourth what male players do — that’s hard to say because compensation varies by player and year-to-year, depending on how many games they play and at what level of competition. Website FiveThirtyEight conducted its own analysis of the federation’s financial documents, comparing the compensation of two male players to two female players of similar seniority in their respective World Cup years. FiveThirtyEight found that given those conditions, the men made almost twice as much as the women. The FiveThirtyEight analysis concluded that women’s team players Lloyd and Solo likely made about $240,000 in 2015, the year they won the World Cup. But men’s team players Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard made $428,000 and $399,000, respectively, in 2014 when they competed — but did not go very far — in the men’s World Cup tournament. For what it’s worth, the lawyer representing the five women, Jeffrey Kessler, has said that depending on the match, the women might be paid 28 percent to 65 percent less than the men. A U.S. Soccer spokesman told us that when comparing compensation and revenue for the men’s team and the women’s team needs to be looked at over a course of four or eight years cumulatively instead of just one year, as a small window does not provide the entire picture — since men and women play the signature tournament, the World Cup, in different years. Our ruling An image shared by The Other 98 Percent said ""Last year (the U.S. women’s soccer team) generated $20 million more than the men’s team and were paid almost four times less."" The women’s soccer team had a much more successful season on the pitch than the men’s team last year, and as a result they brought in a lot more revenue. But that gap is closer to $5.8 million, not $20 million. And while there seem to be compensation disparities among the women and men, it’s hard to pin down exactly how big that disparity is because the way women and men are paid is so different, and it also varies by match and by player. We couldn't find a clear example of female players being paid one-fourth the amount their male counterparts earn. While there might be legitimate issues concerning the revenue and compensation ratio among the men’s and women’s soccer teams, this graphic uses numbers that are way off.

Rick Scott correct that Florida created 1 million jobs on his watch
","During his confrontation with an unhappy constituent at a Gainesville Starbucks, Florida Gov. Rick Scott heard an earful. But he also dished some out. At one point in the now-viral exchange, Scott responded to the barrage of criticism by customer Cara Jennings with what appears to be an estimate of the jobs created on his watch. ""We got a million jobs,"" Scott said. Jennings wasn’t satisfied -- she ripped Scott by responding, ""A million jobs? Great. Who here has a great job or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?"" Whoever you think won this face-off, we wondered whether Scott was right that Florida ""got a million jobs"" on his watch. So we took a closer look. As we always do when faced with this type of question, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks job data on the federal, state and local level. Since Scott’s brief riposte didn’t specify what type of jobs Scott was talking about, we will assume he was referring to total non-farm employment -- the bureau’s most basic measurement -- rather than private-sector employment, which is a different, narrower category that Scott often refers to. Scott began his tenure in January 2011, so for the full comparison, we can contrast the most recent employment level in the state to the level in either December 2010 or January 2011. As it turns out, both produce the 1 million in gains that Scott referred to. Between December 2010 and February 2016, total nonfarm employment in Florida rose by 1,041,400. And between January 2011 and February 2016, it rose by 1,028,100. (These are net jobs gained, which is the standard measurement economists use.)  So Scott’s boast that Florida ""got a million jobs"" is well supported. That said, we’ll note one caveat that we always raise when analyzing claims such as Scott’s: It’s a stretch for the governor (or the president, or a mayor) to claim credit for such gains. Governors do have an impact on their state’s economy. They can push an agenda of taxing and spending that may help the economy, though the actual impact of such policies on economic growth is always somewhat speculative, since you can’t run an independent experiment with an economy governed by the opposite policies. But even if governors do deserve some credit for how the economy performs on their watch, there are other things over which they have no control that can have impacts that are at least as big, if not bigger. These include changes in technology, fluctuations in the national and international economy, demographic shifts (the Census Bureau estimates the state’s population has increased by about 1.46 million people since April 2010, for instance), and events like natural disasters. Indeed, governors -- like presidents -- tend to get too much credit when things are going well, and too much blame when things are going poorly. ""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office,"" Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless has told PolitiFact previously. ""Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered."" This critique is especially relevant in Scott’s case. Scott took office not long after a severe recession bottomed out. It was no shock that whoever was elected governor in 2010 would benefit from some degree of job growth, since the worst of the recession would be behind them, and the economy tends to run in cycles. As we have previously noted, Scott said the ""7-7-7 Plan"" he ran on in 2010 would create 700,000 jobs on top of the 1 million jobs state economists predicted Florida would add by 2017 no matter what policies came out of Tallahassee. He later denied saying that, but in tracking Scott’s campaign promises, PolitiFact Florida continues to hold him to his pledge to create 1.7 million jobs. (That promise is currently rated In the Works.) In other words, Scott should be pleased that 1-million-plus jobs were created on his watch, but he ought to be humble about how much of a role he played in making it happen. Our ruling Scott said ""we got a million jobs,"" referring to employment in the state of Florida on his watch. On the numbers, Scott is on target -- the figure is actually a bit higher than 1 million net, new, nonfarm jobs. We’ll just note, as we always do in cases like this, that the governor is not solely responsible for this improvement -- other factors played a role too. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-correct-florida-created-1-million-jobs-/

John Kasich's super PAC slams Ted Cruz for TV ad Cruz's campaign didn't make
","Businessman Donald Trump may have called Sen. Ted Cruz ""Lyin' Ted,"" but a political action committee supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich has picked up the moniker in an attack ad against Cruz. ""Many just call him 'Lyin' Ted,' "" the ad begins, as Cruz's nose begins to grow, curving around his head and neck. ""His TV ad about John Kasich? Lie! Stations had to pull it off the air. If Ted Cruz's mouth is moving, he's lying."" We wanted details about an ad that was allegedly so wrong it had to be pulled. Our nosiness uncovered an important point: The ad that was pulled wasn't Cruz's ad. The super PAC that attacks Cruz as a liar is New Day for America, based in Kasich's home state. Spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp said its ad is attacking an anti-Kasich ad released by another super PAC, Trusted Leadership, which supports Cruz. The pulled ad, released March 29, shows side-by-side images of Kasich and George Soros, a liberal billionaire investor who is backing Hillary Clinton. Soros is reviled among conservatives the way the Koch brothers are disparaged by liberals. The image on the screen shows side-by-side photos of Soros and Kasich with the words, ""Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros."" Simultaneously, the announcer says, ""Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling (Kasich's) super PAC."" PolitiFact Ohio ruled that ad False, because Soros has not given any money to Kasich or his super PAC, and the ""working side by side"" reference is tenuous. It refers to one donor who managed assets for Soros from 1988 to 2000 and another who is the former chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management and started his own hedge fund with $2 billion in seed money from Soros. New Day complained about the Trusted Leadership commercial to the Wisconsin television stations that aired it, saying that unlike ads from the candidates themselves, stations have no obligation to run false or misleading super PAC ads. At least four stations pulled it, according to New Day, which provided supporting correspondence. (Trusted Leadership subsequently replaced the anti-Kasich spot with a revised ad that took out the words ""Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros,"" and used ""Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros cronies"" instead.) There is, however, a larger problem with New Day's claim that this was another of Ted Cruz's ""lies."" Neither Cruz nor his campaign were responsible for the deceptive ad. It was the super PAC that supports him. That's a big distinction. Under federal law, the Cruz super PAC is not allowed to coordinate with Cruz or his campaign, or vice versa, and no one has put forward any evidence of that here. (There's a lot of suspicion that this barrier to coordination is more of a screen door than a wall. A campaign can easily see what the candidate's super PAC is doing publicly, and vice versa. So no illegal consultation is necessary to get them both on the same page, making it look like coordination.) Despite that legal separation, the New Day commercial specifically blames Cruz, giving him the ever-elongating nose and stating that if Cruz's lips are moving, he's lying. That makes New Day's TV commercial as misleading as the TV commercial it's complaining about. File this under ""irony."" And on the Truth-O-Meter, we rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/apr/06/new-day-america/john-kasichs-super-pac-slams-ted-cruz-tv-ad-cruzs-/

Was Villanova’s big win a ‘come-from-behind victory,’ as Hillary Clinton said?
","The Villanova Wildcats are about to march down Philadelphia’s Market Street in a victory parade, days after being named National Champions in a nail-biter of a game. But was that a come-from-behind win? During a campaign stop to the AFL-CIO Convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton riled up the crowd with a quip about Villanova’s buzzer-beating final shot that clinched the Wildcats the national championship. ""I love those come-from-behind victories,"" she said. Sure, it was an off-the-cuff remark about a basketball game. But, given the enthusiasm of Philadelphia sports fans, we decided to check the claim: Was Villanova’s win really of the ""come-from behind"" variety? Not really. Wildcats fans may have been sweating the last few minutes, but Villanova never trailed in the closing stages. Within minutes, Clinton’s campaign defended the remark, saying UNC was leading at the half and, citing FiveThirtyEight, added that the Tar Heels were about twice as likely to win the game at that point before 'Nova came back to take the lead in the second half. Prior to tip-off, ‘Nova was a three-point underdog in the final game of March Madness, despite coming off a 44-point win over Oklahoma in the semi-finals. Villanova was down to North Carolina 39-34 at the half, then trailed by seven points with 19:16 to play in the game before, yes, mounting a comeback. That said, the last lead the Tar Heels held came at the 15:20-minute mark of the second half. The game was tied a few times, but Carolina never held another lead the entire game. Villanova, however, had a 10-point lead with 5:29 to play. The Wildcats’ lead at that time was seemingly so insurmountable, that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight tweeted there was a 96 percent chance Villanova would would win the game. As UNC chipped away to tie things up with seconds left, ‘Nova held on for dear life before Kris Jenkins hit the game winning shot. That three-pointer that went in as the final second on the clock ticked away won the game, 77-74, for Villanova. Our ruling Clinton said during a campaign stop at the AFL-CIO Convention in Philadelphia that she loves ""those come-from-behind victories."" We do, too. But this wasn’t one of them. Villanova didn’t trail in the last 15:20 of the game. Yes, the Cats made a last-second shot to win. But if they missed, the game would have moved onto overtime.

Bernie Sanders has released few tax returns compared with past and present candidates
","Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took some heat from CNN’s Jake Tapper during an April 3 interview. The topic: The degree of public transparency Sanders has provided for his tax returns. Tapper brought up the topic: ""I’m kind of surprised that you haven’t gone further on transparency. You released the summary page of your 2014 tax returns. Hillary Clinton has posted on her website the last eight years of her personal returns, all of the returns. Before the New York primary, will you match her? Will you post your full returns for the last eight years?"" Sanders responded, ""You know who does our tax returns? My wife does our tax returns. We’ve been a little bit busy lately. So we will get out as much information as we can. There ain’t going to be very much exciting in that. I get a salary from the United States Senate, you know, there’s not going to be anything new in it that people haven’t seen for the last many years, but we will get it out as soon as we can."" Tapper wasn’t satisfied. ""But nobody has seen them at all, I guess, is the point, and whether or not there’s anything exciting in them...."" At this point, Sanders interjected, ""No, that is not true. That is not true. Of course, we have released them in the past. Our financial situation, to the best of my knowledge, has not changed very much, but we will get out all of that information as soon as we can."" How transparent has Sanders been with his tax past returns? Not very, compared with others in the 2016 presidential field. Here’s a closer look. As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt. Here’s a look at what their current archive of the 2016 candidates looks like:   In other words, among the candidates still in the race, Sanders’ releases are less extensive than anybody’s but Donald Trump. (Trump, too, has faced criticism for refusing to share his returns.) And Sanders’ shortcomings are actually bigger than the screenshot above would suggest. The 2014 filings Sanders released consist of just the first two summary pages of his Form 1040 and the equivalent summary pages from his home-state Vermont tax form. Why does this matter? Unlike most of the other candidates, Sanders has not released the succeeding pages -- the nitty gritty detail of things like charitable donations and other types of itemized deductions. For instance, Clinton’s release for tax year 2014 is 44 pages long, or more than 10 times the length of Sanders’ for the same year. It’s worth noting that Sanders, as a member of Congress, files annual financial disclosures, which are accessible online back to 2012. And as a presidential candidate, he also files financial disclosure documents to the Federal Election Commission. But tax returns are much more detailed. And despite what Sanders said in the exchange with Tapper, his campaign did not provide PolitiFact with any earlier, publicly available tax forms. The campaign told the Post that it has not released any other tax returns prior to 2014. (The campaign did tell PolitiFact that they would release his 2015 returns once they are filed.) Tax and disclosure experts we contacted agreed that Sanders’ current disclosures are weak by historical standards. ""If I filed the first two pages of my return with the IRS, it would not take long for them to ding me,"" said Kenneth A. Gross of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and a specialist in political disclosure and ethics. ""There is a lot of information on the pages following the cover pages."" Joseph J. Thorndike, the Tax Analysts official who heads the Tax History Project, agreed. Sanders ""has not, in fact, released his most recent tax return,"" Thorndike said. ""He has released a portion of that return. The IRS would not accept a Form 1040 as a complete return and neither should voters. Also, it’s worth noting that Sanders has not released any portion of his older returns. … If Mitt Romney had tried to release an incomplete return in 2012, the media would never have accepted it."" Our ruling Sanders told Tapper that his campaign has released his past tax returns. Sanders said his 2015 return is forthcoming, and he has made other types of disclosures in the past, including congressional and presidential-candidate filings. But his releases of prior-year tax forms -- the specific documents Tapper asked about -- have been limited in several ways. He’s only released information for one year, which pales compared to most other recent presidential candidates, and even that year’s release only includes a summary page, not the full return. We rate his claim False. UPDATE: As he had promised, Sanders released his full 2014 tax return on April 15, 2016. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ba140e0d-4c11-436d-ad29-15e562ba5a98",/factchecks/2016/apr/06/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-has-released-few-tax-returns-compar/

Bill Clinton’s Claim That College Loans Can't Be Refinanced Is Mostly True
","Former President Bill Clinton raised a hot-button issue while stumping for his wife in Los Angeles this week: America’s mounting student loan debt. Student debt in the United States has reached $1.3 trillion, which trails only the amount Americans owe on their mortgages. It’s often blamed for preventing young people from buying houses and cars, which fuels the country’s economy. Undergraduates in the class of 2015 finished school with an average of $35,000 in student loan debt, the most in history, according to Edvisors.com, a financial aid website. If elected president in November, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton would remove a unique barrier related to college loans, the former president claimed. ""A college loan is the only loan in the United States that you cannot refinance when interest rates go down,"" Bill Clinton said, speaking at a recent campaign rally at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. We wondered: Is refinancing really off-limits for all college loans? With student loan debt such a big issue this election year, we decided to check the facts.  Past efforts at change Both Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, have pledged to allow student loans to be refinanced. But they weren’t the first to call for this change. In June 2014, Senate Republicans rejected legislation by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that would have let student borrowers refinance their federal loan debt. ""Homeowners are refinancing. Small businesses are refinancing. We just want young people who got an education to have their shot,"" Warren was quoted as saying in a Washington Post news article at the time. Republicans said they were not convinced the legislation would have resulted in lower borrowing costs, and labeled it an election stunt.  The bill would have let people with federal and private loans issued prior to 2010 refinance at 3.86 percent, the article said. It added that the Obama administration estimated that the bill could have helped 25 million borrowers save $2,000 each over the lifetime of their loans, or $50 billion.  Former President Bill Clinton speaks during a campaign stop for his wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2016, at the West End Community Development Center in Greenville, S.C. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) Our research As they’ve campaigned across the country, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Sanders have each pledged to allow for refinancing of college loan debt. What they, and apparently Bill Clinton, are talking about is refinancing federally backed student loans, which account for about 90 percent of all student borrowing. We turned to the nonprofit college planning group American Student Assistance for some advice. They and other groups say federal student loans can be refinanced into private loans. But doing so can remove federal protections such as fixed interest rates and the ability to pause repayments. Also, private student loans can be refinanced into new lower-interest private loans. But there’s no provision in federal law allowing the refinancing of a federal loan to another, lower-interest federal loan. ""There is no federal refinancing. Congress sets the interest rate for federal student loans, and most of these rates are fixed by law, no matter how solid your credit or income becomes post-graduation,"" American Student Assistance advises potential borrowers. PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim in 2014 and rated it Mostly True. They spoke with Heather Jarvis, a North Carolina attorney specializing in student loan law, who told them some graduates may be able to refinance student loans at lower rates through private lenders. But, she said, this would only happen in cases in which borrowers have substantial income. Jarvis added that ""refinancing federal loans with a private loan is risky.  The borrower gives up important protections that accompany federal loans (like flexible repayment and discharge provisions)."" Students repaying federally backed loans, Jarvis said, are effectively barred from refinancing opportunities because federal law makes no provision for the government to make such offers. Asked about the former president’s statement, Bill Clinton’s press secretary said in an email ""it’s very safe to say that the vast majority of students with debt have federal debt."" She pointed to statistics from the College Board showing federal loans account for about 90 percent of student borrowing. She said a small percentage of borrowers can refinance a federal student loan by making it a private loan. Our ruling Former President Bill Clinton said at a recent campaign rally in Los Angeles: ""A college loan is the only loan in the United States that you cannot refinance when interest rates go down."" Borrowers of federally backed student loans, which account for about 90 percent of student loans, cannot refinance those into lower-interest federal loans. Congress sets the interest rate on these loans, and there’s no provision in federal law that allows for them to be refinanced. Depending on factors such as income, some borrowers can refinance their federal loans into lower-interest private loans, though they risk losing their federal loan protections. Clinton most likely was referring only to federally backed loans when he made his statement, but a clarification about private loans would have helped. We rated his claim Mostly True.

Does Clinton really have 2.5 million more votes than Sanders?
","Momentum in politics might be hard to define, and it might be fleeting, but one thing is sure -- you don’t want the other guy to have it. So when on April 5, 2016, one of the hosts of ABC’s The View began a question to Hillary Clinton with the fact that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had won five out of the past six contests, Clinton made sure that didn’t hang in the air very long. ""You have to look at the broader perspective,"" Clinton said. ""He’s won some, and I’ve won some, but I have 2 and a half million more votes than he does. And I have a very significant lead in delegates."" (Separately, Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook made the same claim in an April 4 Medium post titled, ""To Hillary Clinton supporters: The facts on where the race stands."") Does Clinton have a 2.5 million-vote lead over Sanders? We asked both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns for their numbers. Sanders’ staff pointed us to a spreadsheet produced by Fair Vote, an advocacy group that supports new approaches to voting to reduce partisanship. The Clinton campaign also sent us their election vote tally. There’s really only one significant hitch in all of the data. For states that hold primaries, you can see how many votes were cast for Clinton and Sanders. That also true for some, but not all, caucus states. So for example, Colorado held a caucus and Sanders got 71,928 votes compared with Clinton’s 49,256. But for Iowa, Nevada and Maine, the only numbers that get reported are the delegates awarded to each candidate. The ratio of delegates to votes varies from precinct to precinct so there’s no way to do some simple math to get to the underlying number of votes. Sam Lau, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, told us ""I don’t know of any data on this."" The situation is the same for Nevada and Maine. And a Washington Democratic Party staffer told us they would have the raw vote tallies eventually, but right now, they were still getting packets sent in from around the state and tabulating them. Where does that leave us? Well, with the Wisconsin vote not yet in, based on the Fair Vote totals, the primary tallies stand at 8,746,692 for Clinton compared to 6,049,960 for Sanders. This gives Clinton nearly 2.7 million votes more than her rival. But when we factor in the caucuses with full vote counts, Clinton’s margin drops to a bit over 2.5 million. (Those states are Utah, Nebraska, Minnesota, Kansas, Idaho, Hawaii, Colorado and Alaska.) Would the actual votes from the remaining caucuses in Iowa, Nevada, and Maine, as well as Washington, change the totals very much? No one can say for sure, because literally, no one has the numbers. One can run some rough estimates by taking the estimated Democratic turnout and allocating them by the same percentage as the delegates that were awarded. Do that and Clinton loses about another 100,000 votes compared to Sanders. Rob Richie, executive director at Fair Vote, told us that approach is flawed, but his sense is the result is about right. ""At the end of the day, Clinton has between 2.4 (million) and 2.5 million more votes than Sanders,"" Richie said. ""It’s a little less, but not too much less, than what you see now."" Our ruling Clinton said she has received 2.5 million more votes than Sanders. That claim can’t be completely verified because we don’t have the raw vote totals from the caucus states of Iowa, Nevada, Washington and Maine. However, given the numbers we do have, it is likely that Clinton’s lead is at least in the neighborhood of 2.4 million votes. That’s not much of a difference.

Immigration debate enters key Nevada state Senate race
","The federal immigration debate is turning into a down-ballot issue in Nevada. Assembly freshmen Erv Nelson and Victoria Seaman are entwined in an ugly Republican primary battle for a critical state Senate seat that holds the potential to tip the balance in the 11-10 Republican-controlled state Senate. Seaman has relentlessly attacked Nelson, and one of her campaign flyers accuses him of supporting a ""pro-amnesty"" immigration bill. ""Why did Erv Nelson vote yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country?""
  Because immigration is an important topic in Nevada — a state with a ""top share of unauthorized immigrants"" — we wanted to fact-check this claim. The accusation leads back to a resolution approved by bipartisan majorities in both houses of the Legislature in 2015: Senate Joint Resolution 21. Nelson voted for the resolution, while Seaman and 10 other Assembly Republicans voted ""no."" It passed unanimously in the Senate. The only Assembly member to comment on the resolution’s passage was Republican Michele Fiore, who called it a ""warm and fuzzy feel-good bill"" only to be used for ""political benefit"" in future elections. ""Since it basically does nothing, I urge my fellow colleagues to support SJR 21,"" she said during a marathon Assembly session shortly before midnight on May 22, 2015. The resolution is straightforward. It’s little more than two pages listing facts about immigration and urging Congress to take up the issue, and to include ""earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship."" It rehashes similar legislation also approved by bipartisan majorities in 2013. So claiming Nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate, as the resolution clearly spells out. But calling the resolution ""pro-amnesty"" is harder to prove. In response to questions from PolitiFact, Seaman’s campaign sent a two-page letter arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty, as ""citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people."" Use of the word ""amnesty"" in immigration policy is contentious, and there’s no agreed upon metric by which the word should be used. PolitiFact did look into use of the word ""amnesty"" by Republicans critical of President Barack Obama’s proposed immigration policies in 2011 and 2012, but it’s much more difficult due to differences in the 1,200-page immigration bill in 2013 and the two-page resolution approved by lawmakers in 2015. In general, amnesty is defined as granting permanent immunity from punishment for a group of people who have broken the law. It’s true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as ""amnesty"", but the resolution is just so vague that it’s difficult to call it ""pro-amnesty."" A 2011 PolitiFact check found that use of the politically charged word is ""debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation."" The resolution additionally doesn’t really do anything other than, in the words of one supporter, ""send a strong message to Congress"" to take up immigration reform. Nelson didn’t answer multiple calls seeking comment, but neither candidate played much of a role on any of the 2015 bills that could have actually affected the undocumented immigrant community. Both lawmakers voted for a successful measure making it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a teacher’s license in Nevada. And neither Seaman nor Nelson played a role in a measure prohibiting contractors from hiring unauthorized immigrants, which failed to pass out of committee. Ultimately, there just isn’t a lot that state-level lawmakers can do on immigration policy outside of ""symbolic"" gestures like the immigration reform resolution, as it’s almost entirely a federally managed issue. Nevada did approve driver authorization cards for people not legally in the country in 2013, but neither Seaman nor Nelson was in office at the time. It’s worth noting that Seaman appears to have voted for the resolution during an earlier committee meeting, according to legislative records requested by PolitiFact. A video of the meeting is online, but it’s difficult to tell if she’s present during the voice vote. That isn’t necessarily an endorsement, as many lawmakers will vote to get legislation out of committee to the floor so more lawmakers can weigh in. Seaman’s campaign manager claims she was not in the room during the vote. Our ruling Seaman says Nelson voted ""yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country."" To be clear, the ""bill"" was actually a resolution that holds no teeth. It calls for a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. But it's too vague to blankly say it falls under the ""amnesty"" umbrella, and just doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of the immigration debate.

Barack Obama jumps the gun on U.S. uninsured rate, then reverses course
","On the sixth anniversary of his signing of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama took a victory lap on Medium. In a brief article punctuated by several celebratory photographs, Obama wrote, ""20 million. That’s how many people now have the health coverage they need thanks to the president’s health care law. In fact, for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of Americans have health coverage, putting the U.S. rate of uninsured Americans at 8.8 percent."" When we began to check the percentage of uninsured Americans, we found some discrepancies. After we told the White House about our concerns -- but before we were able to publish our fact-check -- the White House made a change to the text of the Medium post and noted that a correction had been made. The White House confirmed that it had changed the language after our inquiries. Fact-checker success! We’ll address the White House’s correction and change in this fact-check, but our policy is to fact-check the way a claim was phrased originally. The confusion generated by this case stems from the reality that there are several different measurements of uninsured Americans, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. (The Kaiser Family Foundation has assembled a helpful cheat sheet to sort through the various measurements.) The gold standard of measurements is considered to be the data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. However, the bureau only publishes its uninsured number once a year, and the figure released most recently -- 10.4 percent uninsured for calendar year 2014 -- is out of date. Here’s the summary of the Census Bureau’s most recent data.  A more frequently updated yardstick -- released every quarter -- is Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. The most recent number from Gallup, for the fourth quarter of 2015, shows the uninsured rate at 11.9 percent. That’s higher than what Obama cited in his Medium post, but Gallup’s figure is always a bit higher than other numbers because it only surveys adults. On average, adults are somewhat more likely to be uninsured than children. Here’s what Gallup’s recent trend line looks like.  When we asked health policy experts if they could think of what Obama might have been pointing to, they suggested the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey. The most recent data from this survey covers the first three quarters of 2015, making it the most recent large-scale federal source for data on the uninsured. Using this survey, Obama came pretty close: The uninsured rate through September 2015 was 9.1 percent, and as the chart below shows, this came after consistent declines in the uninsured rate since 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act was signed.  Still, the White House specified an uninsured rate of 8.8 percent. So where did that come from? To get there, the White House relied on Department of Health and Human Services projections of the uninsured rate through the first quarter of 2016 -- two quarters beyond the last hard data from the National Health Insurance Survey. Here’s a graphic from the Council of Economic Advisers illustrating what the White House did:  What the White House did in this slide is a ""reasonable approach,"" said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Still, the problem with the wording in the Medium post is that the White House didn’t acknowledge that it was using a projection -- it used the present tense, suggesting it was citing current, validated data. When we contacted several health care experts before the White House changed the post, most agreed that the White House should have been more careful with its figures. ""In the end, I don’t think a difference of 0.3 percent matters that much -- the 9.1 percent figure is an impressive achievement in and of itself,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, chair of the department of social medicine at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. ""But it would have been better for them to say something like the uninsured rate in September 2015 stood at 9.1 percent and they project that it has since fallen to 8.8 percent."" Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed. The actual numbers are ""impressive on their own,"" she said. ""There was no need to gild the lily."" After our inquiry, the White House changed the 8.8 percent projection to the 9.1 percent figure offered by the CDC survey and noted the change with a correction. Our ruling Obama, in his Medium post, said the ""rate of uninsured Americans (is) 8.8 percent."" Hats off to the White House for correcting its post based on our inquiry, even before we could publish our fact-check. Still, we put claims to the Truth-O-Meter based on their original form, and in this case, Obama, despite being close to accurate, jumped the gun by shaving off a few tenths of a percentage point before they officially materialized. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-jumps-gun-us-uninsured-rate-then-reve/
