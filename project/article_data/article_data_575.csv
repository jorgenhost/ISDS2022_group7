 Hard to pin down growing cost of unused border materials
","Republicans, including members of Congress from Iowa, continue to criticize President Biden for how he is handling the U.S.-Mexican border. Rep. Ashley Hinson went to the border as June started to bring attention to her opposition to Biden's handling of border security. Sen. Chuck Grassley says he too is fighting Biden’s border policies. U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has been especially active on border policies, writing in a May 28 newsletter: ""Well here’s something you may not know your tax dollars are being spent on: unused border wall materials."" This has been happening since Biden terminated construction of President Trump’s wall on the U.S.-Mexico border on Jan. 20, 2021, Ernst wrote. Grassley said he agrees with her assessment.  Ernst’s claim raises questions about responsible federal spending, so we took a look at it. The claim, which her office said comes from a 2021 Senate Republican staff report criticizing spending on unused materials at the border, made the rounds in conservative media in conjunction with Ernst introducing the BUILD IT Act in May. That act would terminate contracts relating to building the border wall and transfer unused fence material to Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas state government on the southwest border. In total, Trump had planned to spend $16.5 billion on the border wall: $10 billion from funds diverted from the Defense Department, $5.8 billion from a congressional appropriation and $600 million from forfeitures collected by the Treasury Department, a May 2021 Congressional Research Service report stated. In the days before Biden was inaugurated in 2021, Trump ramped up construction of the border wall by extending for one year a national emergency he had declared in February 2019 to build the wall. Biden suspended all construction on his first day in office, leaving unused steel panels and piping at construction sites along the border. Most estimates place the value of surplus material at $265 million, with some estimates as high as $350 million. Some of the material intended for the border wall is being used elsewhere. In February 2022, more than 1,700 unused panels were donated by the federal government to Texas to help build Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s state-funded border wall. A Defense Department spokesman said the total value of all the donated panels was $6 million, the Arizona Daily Star reported. The Daily Star reported that federal agencies receiving materials include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, along with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). But representatives from neither agency responded to questions about how much material was received. The Interior Department also received nearly $1 million in bulk packaging and miscellaneous construction materials. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security authorized in December 2021 use of some of the remaining materials to close breaches in a Texas levee along the Rio Grande River and to backfill erosion in San Diego. The Biden Administration said wall construction created these problems. A Department of Homeland Security press release said other clean-up projects at construction sites have been approved, including road repair and installing drainage systems. Ernst wrote in her newsletter that guarding these materials costs ""millions of dollars per day.""  Her staff cited for PolitiFact Iowa the Interim Minority Report issued in July 2021 from the Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management. That Republican report states that, at the time of publication, the Defense Department continued to spend $3 million per day ""to guard steel, concrete, and other materials in the desert."" The estimate of $3 million in costs per day has not been confirmed independently. The Republican report stated that the cost was determined through communications with the Defense Department and the Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management. The Republicans’ 2021 congressional report does not state if the costs for clean-up projects is included in the $3 million daily figure. Canceled contracts still cost taxpayers because the Defense Department has to negotiate its withdrawal from seven remaining contracts, the Republican report states. Department estimates show the federal government could spend at least $798 million and $1.048 billion by the end of 2022 on leaving contracts for the seven projects, the report states. A February 2021 U.S. Government Accountability Office report said the Defense Department spent about $1 billion helping at the border in fiscal years 2018 through 2020. But, the report stated, the department was late in providing more accurate costs for that time period and was not tracking internal costs. Military personnel at the border may only support Homeland Security officers and cannot make arrests. Homeland Security officials wanted the military to stay in the region three to five years, the 2021 report stated, but reliable cost estimates for doing so were not available.  About $5.3 billion of the Defense Department’s diverted funding had been spent on wall construction and about $4.75 billion remained committed when Biden took office, the May 2021 non-partisan Congressional Research Service report stated. News reports in June 2021 said Biden returned the last batch of diverted funds – more than $2 billion – to the Defense Department. Defense Department leaders estimated it would cost the federal government around $1.4 billion to suspend and terminate contracts, pending negotiations with contractors to cancel them, an internal department memo stated. We asked Ernst’s Senate staff whether or not the costs of these clean-up projects are accounted for in $3 million daily costs. Staff responded in an email that these are projects ""that the Biden administration is currently spending taxpayer money on as a result of President Biden’s decision to cancel the border wall, which was already under construction.""  Ernst’s office also did not answer if the $3 million per day cost has changed since last July. Ernst’s May 28 newsletter claims that unused materials remain at construction sites, and that taxpayers are footing the bill to guard these materials. How much waste exists is a judgment call but Ernst is correct that around $265 million dollars in manufacturing materials, including panels, electrical supplies and light poles, were left at construction sites along the southern border with Mexico after Biden halted border wall construction. However, some of these materials are being used to repair gaps at insecure points in the barrier, while others have been sent to other government agencies, including the state of Texas for wall construction. No independent source has confirmed the $3 million daily cost that Ernst cites, and a nonpartisan government agency says reliable cost estimates for Defense Department work at the border are lacking or late. News organizations still are waiting to learn actual costs. We rate the claim to be Half True.

Arizona US Senate race attack tying Masters to Nazis, Unabomber and anti-Israel stance lacks context
","Displeased that his competitor in the Arizona Republican primary for U.S. Senate won an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, Jim Lamon took to social media to lay out why that was the wrong call. Blake Masters, Lamon argued, would be unelectable in a general election against Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly. ""Blake Masters would be shred to pieces by Mark Kelly and the Democrats as someone who has unironically quoted a Nazi, called World War II an unjust war, called the Unabomber one of his intellectual influencers, and shared an article attacking Israel as the North Korea of the Middle East,"" Lamon tweeted June 2, the same day Trump issued his endorsement. Under the banner of America First, Lamon and Masters share many common policy positions. They both have questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election. They say tougher border security is a matter of public safety, and see China as a key threat to American jobs. They oppose ""critical race theory"" in schools, although it isn’t part of K-12 school curricula.  Neither man has run for office before. Lamon chairs a solar power company and served in the Army as an airborne officer. Masters recently stepped down as an executive in a venture capital investment fund overseen by billionaire PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. Thiel has put more than $13 million into a Super PAC to promote Masters, and lobbied Trump to endorse him. Fox News host Tucker Carlson called Masters ""the future of the Republican Party."" Here, we look into Lamon’s four claims about Masters, Nazis, World War II, the Unabomber and Israel.  
Hermann Goering, right, pictured with Adolf Hitler, center, during the ceremony in Berlin on June 6, 1939. (AP) Yes, Masters quoted a Nazi, but context here matters. It appeared in a 2006 essay Masters wrote while in college at Stanford University. The essay was 19-year-old Masters’ take on how the government uses propaganda to win popular support for war. (Masters is now 35.) In the piece, Masters argued that ""government creates war for no good reason."" War, he said, enriches the wealthy and does nothing for the average citizen. Masters described how President Woodrow Wilson built the case for America’s entry into World War I, and how the largest banks profited from it. The essay ends with a quote from Hermann Goering, convicted war criminal and Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man during the Nazi regime. ""The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders,"" Goering said in an interview with American psychologist Gustave Gilbert, who published the statement in his book, ""Nuremberg Diary."" ""That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country."" The quote highlighted the sort of manipulative messaging that Masters condemned in his essay. Masters’ use of ""unjust"" came from the same college essay. Masters wrote: ""Unjust wars (and the U.S. hasn’t been involved in a just war in over 140 years) always benefit certain groups and ultimately serve the aspirations of the political class in general at the expense of thousands and millions of lives."" The span of 140 years would include World War II. Masters has since stepped back from that part of his essay. ""I was 19, writing in opposition to the Iraq War — a stance that turned out to be prescient,"" Masters said in a statement published in to Jewish Insider in April. ""I went too far and stated that no recent American wars have been just."" Amalia Halikias, a spokesperson for Masters’ campaign, said Masters has made it clear that ""he believes American involvement — and victory — in WWII was just."" In 2010, Masters shared to his father’s Facebook page a link to an article that likened Israel to North Korea. The 2010 article on a libertarian website (the same one that republished Masters’ 2006 college essay) detailed the plight Gazans and Palestinians face under the ""unjust rule of the Israeli military."" In it, the author wrote, ""Israel is increasingly the North Korea of the Middle East."" The Facebook post is no longer public, but the April Jewish Insider article included a link to a screenshot. The image shows Blake Masters shared the article link with his father, Scott Masters. The Masters campaign didn’t challenge Laman’s assertion that Masters had shared the article. Halikias said ""Blake is a strong defender of Israel.""  On his website under his first priority, ""Make America Safe Again,"" Masters promises to ""get rid of ‘wokeness’ in our military"" and then to ""support military action only in defense of the U.S. and our allies like Israel."" He also promises to ""get tough on China, by far our top geopolitical rival."" Lamon said Masters quoted a Nazi, called World War II unjust, named the Unabomber as one of his intellectual influencers, and shared an article attacking Israel as the North Korea of the Middle East. Each of these statements has some truth, but leaves out key details. Lamon left out that it was in a college essay in which Masters used a Nazi quote to highlight how governments use propaganda to win support for wars that don’t help their people. In the same essay, Masters implicitly called World War II an unjust war. He has since acknowledged that the statement ""went too far."" Masters did praise Kaczynski's thoughts, but it was in response to a question about a ""subversive thinker,"" and Masters condemned Kaczynski’s actions, calling him a ""terrorist.""  Lamon said Masters ""shared an article attacking Israel."" Masters shared the article on his father’s Facebook page. We rate Lamon’s statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EA9B7C0>],/factchecks/2022/jun/16/jim-lamon/arizona-us-senate-race-attack-ties-masters-nazis-u/

Image of anti-Biden restaurant sign about gas prices was digitally altered
","Burgers, milkshakes, fries and … an attack on President Joe Biden?  A viral image purports to show a restaurant chain taking a swipe against Biden with an outdoor sign blaming him for high gas prices. But the anti-Biden message is a fake.  The image shows what appears to be a sign associated with Big Boy, a Michigan-based fast-food chain, sporting a message that takes a dig at Biden and a victory lap for his predecessor.  ""President Donald Trump predicted if Biden was elected, you'd see $5, $6 and $7 gas,"" the lettering says. ""He was right."" The image was shared widely on Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  ""My favorite burger joint summed it up perfectly,"" one June 14 post said.  Only, the restaurant didn’t sum anything up. There’s no evidence PolitiFact could find that any Big Boy location had decorated a sign with such an attack.  Instead, the image of the sign was digitally altered. (We reached out to Big Boy for comment, but we did not receive a response.) Trump did say in multiple speeches during his reelection campaign that gas prices would jump to ""$5, $6 or $7"" per gallon under a Biden presidency — although as PolitiFact has reported, Biden has had little to do with the hike in prices.  But the image circulating on social media appears to have been created using a meme generator available for free online. PolitiFact could not determine what the sign in the image originally said, but reverse image searches on TinEye and Yandex turned up several other memes altering the sign’s lettering in the same fashion and dating back at least as far as 2006.  Older memes have changed the sign’s message to make jokes about the restaurant serving everything from deadly soup to figurines of the Virgin Mary to ""covfefe"" — a reference to a likely typo in a viral tweet Trump sent in 2019. Others have targeted Democrats. One showed a purported sign saying Big Boy was selling cake ""so rich the Democrats want 90% of it.""  Another, fact-checked by Reuters, pretended to show the restaurant inviting patrons to watch Fox News host ""Tucker Carlson on our big screen"" instead of the first hearing from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Using the online meme generator, PolitiFact was able to replicate the viral image claiming to show a Big Boy sign faulting Biden for high gas prices. We also created another. It says: ""We rate this viral image False.""",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E1D8540>],/factchecks/2022/jun/16/viral-image/image-anti-biden-billboard-about-gas-prices-was-di/

This 95-item list doesn’t prove there are ongoing plans to create food shortages
","It’s a frighteningly specific list of 95 agricultural incidents involving fires and ""destroyed"" poultry — and it’s all over social media. It begins: ""1 — 4/30/21 Monmouth Smithfield Foods pork processing plant ""2 — 7/25/21 Memphis Kellogg plant ""3 — 8/13/21 JBS beef plant"" And it ends: ""93 — 5/29/22 200,000 Chickens killed in fire in Minnesota ""94 — 5/31/22 3,000,000 chickens destroyed at Forsman egg farm facility in Stockholm Township, Minnesota ""95 — 6/2/22 30,000 ducks destroyed at Duck farm Berks Pennsylvania."" ""You are duped if you think they aren’t planning a food shortage,"" read a version we found posted June 7 on Facebook. ""Far too many reasons to make sure you are stocked up for when things get much tighter."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact wondered if there was anything to this lengthy claim, so we reviewed each of the incidents cited and found no merit to the suggestion that anything nefarious is afoot. More than half are the result of a raging poultry epidemic. Seven incidents on the list were duplicates — sometimes repeated within a few lines of each other. And out of roughly 30 fires listed, PolitiFact found only one was determined to have been intentionally set.  Others didn’t happen when the list said they did. The post said a fire destroyed a meat plant in Fayetteville, Illinois, in February, for example. But that fire actually happened on Jan. 11, 2021, and officials said it was not considered suspicious. Similarly, in April 2020, a chicken processing plant in Delaware killed nearly 2 million chickens as a result of COVID-19 related staff shortages. The post wrongly claimed those chickens were killed in April 2022. We were unable to find evidence that two incidents — 76,400 turkeys being destroyed in Osceola County, Iowa, in March and 2 million chickens being destroyed at an egg laying farm in Minnesota in April — happened at all. Here’s what we learned about the other 84 incidents listed in the post:  Fifty of the incidents listed involved birds such as chickens, turkeys or ducks being killed to contain an ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. It is very contagious and often fatal among birds. Using local news reports and a U.S. Department of Agriculture database that tracks confirmed detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza, PolitiFact verified that 50 of the items on the list refer to incidents where the virus was detected, which resulted in — or will result in — the impacted flocks being killed. Rick Coker, a spokesperson for the Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said that the virus is currently spreading across the U.S. ""primarily due to the migration of wild birds.""  Once the virus is detected, the goal is to humanely kill infected flocks within 24 hours of diagnosis to reduce the presence of the virus in the environment, he said. Avian flu doesn’t usually spread to humans but there have been some rare cases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 38 million birds have died or been killed to contain the virus in the 2022 outbreak so far. Even so, Coker said, ""there is no reason to believe that this or any other (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak was suspicious or that any entity is targeting the U.S. poultry supply.""  ""Avian influenza is ubiquitous in the environment and when conditions are favorable the virus can spread quickly unchecked,"" he said, adding that the virus detected in the United States closely matches genetically with the virus that has been circulating in wild bird populations in Europe since 2021. The post included 30 additional fires at places such as farms, food processing plants and storage facilities.  As of June 14, PolitiFact found only one fire that investigators said was set intentionally — and the fire destroyed a food pantry, not a ""food plant"" as the post claimed. Garrard County Food Pantry in Kentucky was destroyed by a fire on Nov. 14, 2021, and law enforcement officials arrested a woman and charged her with second degree arson and first degree criminal mischief, according to news reports. A majority of the fires listed — 18 — weren’t suspicious and were instead accidental or caused by typical malfunctions you might expect at farms and food manufacturing facilities, according to local officials. For example, a fire caused significant damage to a building at the Shadow Brook Farm and Dutch Girl Creamery in Lancaster County, Nebraska on Feb. 28. The state fire marshal said it was an accidental electrical fire. Nine fires remained under investigation as of June 14, but some early reports indicated that officials did not suspect foul play. Two fires had unknown causes, and it was not clear based on news reports whether they were being investigated. Birgitte Messerschmidt, the director of research for the National Fire Protection Association, said fires are more common than most people realize.  ""It can sound like a lot when you hear about several of these fires,"" Messerschmidt said. ""But it really is nothing out of the ordinary."" She said she’s researched fires in food manufacturing and food storage for years and ""they’ve been happening around the globe, regularly."" Messerschmidt said she has not noticed a notable uptick in fires at food production sites in 2022. After looking into the recent fires, she said she has found nothing to indicate there is a link between the fires or that a group might be trying to intentionally create food shortages. In addition, we found that the post relayed incorrect information about some of the fires. The post claimed a ""barn full"" of cows burned in March, implying the animals died, for example, but local farmers actually rescued 42 cows from a Pennsylvania dairy farm blaze on March 13.  The post also included a few other incidents, most of which remain under investigation as of June 14. It is unclear what impact, if any, some of these incidents had on food production. People were exposed to an ammonia leak at Lincoln Premium Poultry in Fremont, Nebraska, on Feb. 19. Plant operations were put on hold. A pilot delivering packages for UPS died on April 13 after her plane crashed into a Gem State Processing Plant. Officials are investigating the crash. The plant did not appear significantly damaged, photos of the scene show. On April 21, a plane crashed into an isolated area of a General Mills cereal plant, killing two aboard. No one on the ground was injured. The cause of the crash had not yet been determined, and the investigation could take up to two years. A Florida East Coast Railway cargo train carrying limestone derailed on May 19. Officials said the derailed cars were empty and the cause of the derailment had not been determined. Facebook posts sharing a 95-item list of alleged food-destroying incidents said the list demonstrates that ""you are duped if you think they aren’t planning a food shortage."" Most of the incidents listed involved chickens or turkeys being killed because they were exposed to a highly contagious avian influenza and many referenced fires that officials said weren’t suspicious. The post relayed incorrect information about some of the incidents, and we found no evidence that two incidents happened at all. Experts in fire research and avian influenza said the list’s legitimate incidents do not demonstrate that there is an ongoing effort to create food shortages. We rate this post False.

Hoax claim about Mayo Clinic, Trump supporters and ectopic pregnancy is still false

The claim is still false. The tweet from user @drnifkin says, ""When Trump supporters come to my office at the Mayo Clinic, I love misdiagnosing their healthy pregnancies as ectopic so they have to abort their white fetuses."" An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus. That type of pregnancy is not viable because the ""fertilized egg can't survive,"" according to the Mayo Clinic.

""We strongly condemn the posts and have asked Twitter to remove the account,"" the June 29, 2018, tweet from the Mayo Clinic said. Twitter suspended the @drnifkin account. Later in 2018, conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos shared the misinformation on Facebook, the Associated Press reported. At that time, a spokesperson for the Mayo Clinic told the AP there was no doctor by that name at the clinic and the information was false. The Mayo Clinic tweeted in October 2018: ""In June, a troll w/no relationship to Mayo Clinic tweeted a false, inflammatory message that led Twitter to suspend his account until he deleted the tweet. Images of that tweet are again circulating on various social networks. It's a hoax."" We reached out to Young America’s Foundation for comment but did not receive a reply. An Instagram post that’s a screenshot of a tweet says a doctor at the Mayo Clinic is targeting Trump supporters for unnecesary abortions. The false tweet originated in 2018. The Mayo Clinic said at that time there is no doctor by that name at the clinic and the information had come from a troll operating a parody account. Twitter suspended the account that initially tweeted the information. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

The Pentagon didn’t ‘admit’ that there are 46 US-funded biolabs in Ukraine
","The Pentagon released a new fact sheet about the government’s efforts to lessen the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine, Russia and other former Soviet countries — and internet conspiracy theorists took off running. While the document largely repeats information about the programs’ accomplishments and efforts over the last several years, that didn’t stop some internet users from claiming that it contained a bombshell admission. ""US Department of Defense Finally Comes Clean – Admits in Public Document that There Are 46 US Military-Funded Biolabs in Ukraine,"" a June 12 Gateway Pundit headline read. ""US asked to explain after Pentagon admits to operating 46 biolabs in Ukraine after months of denial,"" read another June 12  headline by the Morning Star, a socialist newspaper published in Great Britain. But these are mischaracterizations. The document doesn’t contain any evidence — new or otherwise — of U.S. biolabs in Ukraine.  The 46 facilities referenced in the articles and in the government’s fact sheet are owned and operated by Ukraine, and information about the facilities’ existence has been made publicly available by the Pentagon for some time. The stories were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) When Russia first invaded Ukraine in February, false claims took hold online that Russian President Vladimir Putin was targeting the country over its alleged abundance of U.S.-run biological weapons laboratories. At one point, the claims took on a new twist as some alleged that President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, had funded the supposed labs.  But fabricated stories from Russia proclaiming bioweapon use by the U.S. aren’t new, and allegations of a network of such labs along Russia’s border were shared in its state-run media before the invasion. PolitiFact reached out to the Pentagon for comment but did not hear back. Since 2005, the U.S. has partnered with Ukraine through the Pentagon’s Biological Threat Reduction Program. The purpose is ""to support peaceful and safe biological detection and diagnostic capabilities and to reduce the threats posed by pathogens,"" according to a March 2022 government fact sheet. Andy Weber, a member of the Arms Control Association Board of Directors and a former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical, and biological defense programs, previously told us there are no U.S. military-run labs in Ukraine but rather health labs to help detect, prevent and mitigate infectious disease. The Defense Department’s Cooperative Threat Reduction program ""has provided technical support to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health since 2005 to improve public health laboratories, whose mission is analogous to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"" Weber said.  Also known as the Nunn-Lugar program, the initiative began after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 as a project aimed at dismantling and securing leftover weapons of mass destruction programs in former Soviet countries. The Pentagon hasn’t said anything new about the 46 facilities — we reported about them in April. In fact, the June 9 release at the center of these claims specifically states that Ukraine ""has no nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons programs."" With regard to the 46 facilities, the government fact sheet said the U.S. has: ""Worked collaboratively to improve Ukraine’s biological safety, security, and disease surveillance for both human and animal health, providing support to 46 peaceful Ukrainian laboratories, health facilities, and disease diagnostic sites over the last two decades. The collaborative programs have focused on improving public health and agricultural safety measures at the nexus of nonproliferation.""  In March, the Pentagon said much of the same, adding that the program has invested about $200 million in Ukraine, ""supporting 46 laboratories, health facilities and diagnostic sites"" and that it has ""improved Ukraine’s biological safety, security and surveillance for both human and animal health.""  While the U.S. is providing support for Ukraine, the labs are owned and operated by the Ukrainian government, Robert Pope, director of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Department, previously told PolitiFact. ""Specifically, we make the labs more secure from accidental or intentional release, provide diagnostic equipment, train personnel on the use of the equipment, and train them how to detect potential outbreaks,"" Pope said. ""DTRA not only does this with Ukraine, but also with partners in over 30 countries, at their request, to assist with safe disease detection and diagnosis.""  A Gateway Pundit article said, ""US Department of Defense Finally Comes Clean – Admits in Public Document that There Are 46 US Military-Funded Biolabs in Ukraine."" There was no ""coming clean"" — and the government made no such admission.  The document referenced in the stories repeated known information about 46 Ukrainian-owned-and-operated laboratories, health facilities and diagnostic sites that have received support from the U.S. The document specifically states that Ukraine ""has no nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons programs.""

Democrats still exaggerating GOP backing of Scott’s plan on Social Security, Medicare, taxes
","Social Security, Medicare and taxes are among the hair-trigger topics in American politics. Even a hint of trying to modify, change or raise any of the three can ignite a firestorm.  Enter the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, which had this to say in a May 2, 2022, news release: ""Wisconsinites are fed up with Republican politicians pushing a disastrous agenda that could raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years. The Republican agenda would threaten the hard-earned benefits that Wisconsin seniors rely on and hurt working families across the state.""  That sounded a tad familiar. We previously rated Mostly False a claim from Alex Lasry, a Democrat hoping to take on Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, that said Johnson ""is supporting the Republican plan that phases out Social Security and Medicare."" The election is still about five months away. Can the campaign already be in reruns? Let’s look again: Are Republicans pushing a plan ""that could raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years""? ""Rescue America"" plan rises again When asked for backup, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin staffers pointed – as Lasry did – to the ""Rescue America"" plan, released in February 2022 by U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Florida.  Scott is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. His 11-point plan addresses a range of issues, including education, crime and safety, immigration, government finances and what it labels ""fair, fraud free elections"" and ""Religious liberty/Big tech."" Point number five in the plan – ""Economy/Growth"" — states: ""No government assistance unless you are disabled or aggressively seeking work. If you can work, but refuse to work, you cannot live off of the hard work and sweat of your fellow Americans. All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount. Currently, over half of Americans pay no income tax."" So, that’s where the tax portion of the Democrats’ claim comes from. A May 13, 2022 CNN report says that — if enacted — that would mean a tax increase for millions of people. According to estimates from the Tax Policy Center think tank, about 75 million American households in 2022, or 42% of the total, did not pay federal income tax. Americans who don’t pay federal taxes include the jobless as well as employed people who don’t earn enough money to file tax returns; and some retirees, people with disabilities and stay-at-home parents.  A state-by-state analysis released March 7, 2022, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said it found that in Wisconsin, 32% of residents would see their taxes go up under the proposal.  Meanwhile, as we have noted before, point number six in the plan — ""Government Reform and Debt"" — states: ""All federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again.""  The proposal does not specifically say Medicare and Social Security would be phased out, but does refer to ""federal legislation."" And both programs were created generations ago through federal legislation.  So, that’s the Social Security and Medicare piece. Taken together, the two areas show there’s at least some truth to the claim. The biggest problem with the claim, however, is not whether the details can be extracted from the plan – it’s whether the document is, as stated, broadly endorsed by Republicans. For his part, Scott — his position as head of the Senate GOP campaign arm notwithstanding – has said: ""It’s not the Republican plan. It’s more what I believe in."" He also told The Washington Post that ""everybody’s got a different approach. That’s mine."" In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin said many GOP candidates across the country have declined to explicitly repudiate Scott’s plan.  But that’s different than endorsing it. As we noted in our March 18, 2022, fact-check of the Lasry claim, there is dissension among Republicans. Notably Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky opposes key parts of of the plan. ""Let me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda,"" McConnell said, according to The Associated Press. ""We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half of the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.""  Here’s a sampling of what some GOP senators have said about the plan. Mike Braun of Indiana: ""I’m glad Rick did it. Nothing is going to be perfect"" but ""we’ve got to be for something."" Marco Rubio of Florida:  ""I have not seen the plan. I’ve read about it, but I think it’s good that people offer ideas. I’m not sure I agree with all of them. I don’t know all of the details of the plan.""  John Cornyn of Texas: ""This is not an approach embraced by the entire Republican conference. We’re going to keep our focus on inflation, crime, the border and Afghanistan. And some of these other things are things to think about … after the election is over."" Tommy Tuberville of Alabama: Said he’s ""on board"" with Scott’s blueprint and said Republicans need to be thinking about ""a universal plan that we need to sell to the American people."" Finally, in a news release, Johnson offered praise to Scott for presenting a plan, but stopped short of endorsing it: ""I think it’s important for elected officials to tell their constituents what they are for, and I support Senator Scott for doing so.""  Johnson has said elsewhere he does not agree with all of what is in the plan, and his staff noted that in the past Johnson has said Social Security and Medicare need to be preserved for future generations. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin said Republican politicians are pushing a plan ""that could raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years.""  There is an element of truth to the claim, in that the plan from Scott has those elements. But the claim goes awry by framing it as a plan endorsed by Republicans. Far from it. Scott has said it represents his ideas, not a platform.  And McConnell has explicitly said the two areas the Democrats hammered on will not be part of any GOP agenda. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E4E9500>],/factchecks/2022/jun/15/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democrats-still-exaggerating-gop-backing-scotts-pl/

No evidence Justin Bieber’s facial paralysis caused by COVID-19 vaccine
","Justin Bieber was forced to postpone dates on his world tour this month after announcing that he was diagnosed with a rare illness. The singer took to Instagram on June 10 to tell his fans that he had Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which caused full paralysis on one side of his face. ""For those who are frustrated by my cancellations of the next shows, I’m just physically, obviously, not capable of doing them,"" the 28-year-old said as he spoke to the camera. ""This is pretty serious, as you can see."" The news, coupled with recent health struggles by Bieber’s wife, Hailey, who was hospitalized in March after a blood clot traveled to her brain, has many people on social media tying the couple’s conditions to the COVID-19 vaccine. ""Hailey Bieber had a blood clot in her brain. Justin Bieber now has Ramsay Hunt syndrome,"" read a June 11 Facebook post. "" Both issues have been linked to (vaccines)."" The post — which featured a needle emoji in place of the word ""vaccines"" — was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post appears to be entirely speculative; we found no evidence to support its claims.  Justin and Hailey Bieber each posted videos to social media detailing their recent illnesses. Neither mentioned COVID-19 vaccines as being a factor. It’s also not publicly known if either of them have even received a vaccine. Justin Bieber has been open about his health issues in the past, telling fans on his YouTube series ""Seasons"" in 2020 that he suffered from Lyme disease and Epstein-Barr virus. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox and shingles. If someone has chickenpox as a child, the virus lays dormant and can reactivate when the person reaches adulthood, causing shingles. In some people, shingles develops into Ramsay Hunt syndrome. It affects the facial nerve near the inner ear and can cause swelling, irritation, a painful rash and facial paralysis, among other symptoms. It is not common, affecting about 5 in every 100,000 people, but can happen to anyone who has had chickenpox. It’s treated with antivirals and steroids, and treatment within three days of symptoms leads to better outcomes, according to health officials. It can take weeks, sometimes months, to recover, and sometimes damage can be permanent. We don’t know whether either of the Biebers have received COVID-19 vaccines. We could not find any public comments from them about getting — or not getting — a vaccine. We reached out to Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun through his company’s website, but have not received a response. In December, the Twitter account for updates on the singer’s recent tour, tweeted that multiple tour dates would require attendees to be fully vaccinated. It’s not clear if that decision was made by Bieber and his team, or if it was due to policies of individual venues or local laws.  In February, the singer was diagnosed with a mild case of COVID-19, resulting in the postponement of a show in Las Vegas, according to CNN.  Researchers have documented cases of people developing shingles, or Ramsay Hunt after vaccination, but no causal link has been established to the vaccines, experts told PolitiFact.  There have also been reports of people developing shingles or Ramsay Hunt  after a COVID-19 infection. Bernard Man Yung Cheung, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, and co-author of one case report being used by some to make a connection between the vaccines and Bieber’s illness, said that report should not be taken as evidence against vaccination, in which he and his colleagues are ""firm believers."" The report was about a healthy 37-year-old man who was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome two days after his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in July 2021. Oscar Chou, one of the paper’s authors and a researcher under Cheung, sent responses prepared by the authors in response to questions from PolitiFact. They said the report provides no ""definitive causation relationship between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and COVID-19 vaccines,"" but it’s an area worthy of further research. Shingles have also been reported after other common vaccines, so any reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus may not be specific to COVID-19 vaccines. There is also not a definitive link between the COVID-19 vaccine and shingles, and more large-scale studies are required, they said. Separately, Cheung said all drugs, including vaccines, come with the risk of adverse effects, ""some of which are frequent but harmless, and some of which are rare but harmful."" He said there’s a ""learning curve"" early in a vaccine’s use where side effects would be monitored and ""it was in this spirit that our report was written."" Other health experts we spoke with said that despite these case reports, there is no evidence of an increased risk for shingles or Ramsay Hunt syndrome after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. One study published in March found that people 50 and older with even mild cases of COVID-19 were 15% more likely to develop shingles than those who had not been infected. That risk grew to 21% among people who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Wald said that shingles would develop within a few weeks of a COVID-19 infection, so Bieber’s February illness doesn’t seem related to the virus, unless he was recently reinfected, and it is ""unlikely due to vaccine."" Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said some have hypothesized that reports of post-vaccination reactivation of varicella zoster virus are because immune system changes induced by vaccination ""may lead to less control of latent VZV."" ""Shingles has rarely been reported post-vaccination, but has been reported post-COVID, post-influenza, post-rabies, post-hepatitis A and post-Japanese encephalitis vaccination,"" Adalja said. ""It is difficult to establish causation because shingles is a very common infection and there is a baseline rate that just occurs, especially with advancing age.""  Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said it's possible, but unlikely, that a vaccine could have contributed to Bieber's condition. ""If you ask any scientist, 'is it possible?' almost everybody will say, 'well, perhaps,' because, as you know, COVID and COVID vaccines, particularly COVID itself, have thrown us lots of curveballs. Do I think it's likely? The answer to that is no,"" he said. That's because of the strength of the U.S. vaccine surveillance system, which Schaffner called ""probably the best in the world."" ""There are no data from the surveillance systems that would indicate that the vaccines are out there provoking shingles,"" Schaffner said. ""This question has been asked, not specifically about Ramsay Hunt that I'm aware of, but certainly about shingles. And these surveillance systems have not produced anything like that."" Curtis Gill, a spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the agency ""has detected no unusual or unexpected patterns of Ramsay Hunt syndrome following immunization that would indicate COVID-19 vaccines are causing or contributing to this condition.""  In March, Hailey Bieber went to the hospital after experiencing stroke-like symptoms when a blood clot traveled to her brain. Doctors there told her she had a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, she said in a YouTube video detailing her condition. She received further testing after being discharged and she said doctors told her she had a patent foramen ovale — a hole in her heart that didn’t close the way it’s supposed to after birth. She said doctors told her the clot escaped through that hole and traveled to her brain. As for how she got the blood clot in the first place, Bieber said in the video that ""all of the doctors came to the conclusion that it was a perfect storm that led to me having a small blood clot."" She said they cited three factors: recently starting birth control pills despite a history of migraines, a recent COVID-19 infection and traveling on long flights to and from Paris in a short amount of time. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have not been linked to blood clots, although the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to a rare clotting disorder called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, which is not what Hailey Bieber had.  A Facebook post claimed that Justin Bieber’s diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Hailey Bieber’s blood clot were caused by COVID-19 vaccines. We could find no evidence via public statements that either have been vaccinated. Each of them detailed their health conditions to fans in social media videos, and neither tied them to vaccines. Experts we spoke with said there is no evidence that vaccines are causing or contributing to Ramsay Hunt syndrome. And Hailey’s condition was caused a hole in her heart which allowed a blood clot, possibly caused in part by a COVID-19 infection, to travel to her brain. We rate this claim False. Update, June 16, 2021: This story has been updated to include responses received after publication from Bernard Man Yung Cheung and other authors of a study used by some to link the COVID-19 vaccines to Bieber’s condition. The rating is unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E4FCA00>],/factchecks/2022/jun/15/facebook-posts/no-evidence-justin-biebers-facial-paralysis-caused/

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Karine Jean-Pierre']","
White House gets it wrong on unemployment level when Joe Biden took office
","During a recent press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre played down the impact of President Joe Biden’s policies on inflation.  Inflation has recently been at a 40-year high. Many economists say the American Rescue Plan — the coronavirus relief package that Biden, with only Democratic support in Congress, signed into law shortly after taking office in 2021 — has contributed to the rise in prices. Critics say putting more money in Americans’ pockets when they didn’t need the assistance has been a contributor to inflation, along with pandemic-related supply-chain troubles and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, both of which have disrupted flows of energy, food and other goods. At a June 13 press briefing, Jean-Pierre played defense against the notion that the American Rescue Plan had a role in worsening inflation. The issue came up when a reporter asked about the precipitous drop in the stock market that day; by the end of the day, the benchmark Standard & Poors 500 had fallen by nearly 4%, pushing stocks into bear market territory, which is defined as the markets losing at least 20% of their value from recent highs. ""We know that the high prices are having a real effect on people's lives,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""We get that. And we are incredibly focused on doing everything that we can to make sure that the economy is working for the American people. But we are coming out of the strongest job market in American history, and that matters. And a lot of that is thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which only Democrats voted for, and Republicans did not. It led to this historic economic boom that we're seeing with jobs."" The reporter followed up by asking, ""Didn’t it also lead to historic inflation?""  Jean-Pierre responded, ""That is not how we're seeing the American Rescue Plan. … We have to remember what the president walked into. When he walked into this administration, the economy was at a standstill. Schools were closed. Businesses were shutting down. Twenty million people were on unemployment insurance benefits. That is what he walked into."" A reader asked us whether Jean-Pierre was correct to say that when Biden ""walked into this administration …  20 million people were on unemployment insurance benefits."" Jean-Pierre’s figure is way off. To check what Jean-Pierre said, we looked at two federal statistics. The first is the number of unemployed Americans, estimated every month from a federal survey of households. The unemployment level did peak at about 23 million people in April 2020, right when the economy was closing down due to the coronavirus. But that was nine months before Biden took office — and the number fell significantly before Biden was sworn in.   By January 2021, when Biden was being sworn in, the number of unemployed Americans had fallen by more than half, to 10.2 million. So according to this metric, Jean-Pierre cited a figure roughly double the actual number. But there’s an even better metric to describe the number of Americans who ""were on unemployment insurance benefits."" And using this metric, Jean-Pierre is even further off base. Like the unemployment level, the number of Americans collecting continuing unemployment benefits peaked at 23.1 million in early May 2020, only a few weeks into the pandemic’s initial burst. But this figure fell even further than the unemployment level did. (The difference stems from the fact that not everyone who is unemployed qualifies for unemployment insurance.) On the eve of Biden’s inauguration, the number of Americans collecting continuing unemployment insurance was a little under 4.9 million. That was still higher than the typical level prior to the pandemic — about 1.8 million — but less than a quarter of the 20 million figure that Jean-Pierre cited.   Jean-Pierre argued that the economy was so terrible that the American Rescue Plan was a must. But this glosses over the fact that the worst economic hit from the coronavirus-driven shutdowns occurred in the spring of 2020. Nine months later, when Biden took office, the economy was rebounding.  The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Jean-Pierre said that when Biden ""walked into this administration …  20 million people were on unemployment insurance benefits."" The number of unemployed Americans did crack 20 million early in the pandemic, but Donald Trump was president at the time. By the time Biden was sworn in and was seeking passage of the American Rescue Plan, the number had fallen by about half, to 10 million. An even more appropriate statistic for evaluating Jean-Pierre’s statement — the number of Americans continuing to collect unemployment insurance benefits — had fallen even further by the time Biden took office, to less than 5 million, or just a quarter of what Jean-Pierre had said. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EA08F00>],/factchecks/2022/jun/14/karine-jean-pierre/white-house-gets-it-wrong-unemployment-level-when-/

Fake mugshot showing badly bruised Paul Pelosi circulates online
","A viral image purports to show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband looking badly bruised in a mugshot snapped following his May arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Tucker Carlson is wrong. Firearms, other weapons were found at the Capitol on Jan. 6
","As the first House hearing dedicated to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol aired, Fox News host Tucker Carlson repeated the debunked claim that no one in the crowd was found with a gun.   ""Just to be clear on terms, an insurrection is when people with guns try to overthrow the government,"" Carlson said during his June 10 segment. ""Not a single person in the crowd on January 6 was found to be carrying a firearm. Not one,"" Carslon said. That’s wrong. Court documents, video evidence and news coverage directly contradict this characterization. Several rioters had firearms and dozens more wielded knives, bats and other real and makeshift weapons. We reached out to Carlson for comment but did not hear back. PolitiFact reviewed the case files for hundreds of defendants who were arrested and charged for their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and found several defendants who police say were found to have brought firearms. Some were charged with having firearms on Capitol grounds while others stashed them nearby: Lonnie Coffman of Alabama was found with multiple weapons in his vehicle and on his person. Coffman’s truck, which he had parked in the vicinity of the Capitol on the morning of Jan. 6, was packed with weaponry, including a handgun, a rifle and a shotgun, each loaded, according to court documents. Also, the truck held hundreds of rounds of ammunition, several large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun and 11 Molotov cocktails. When Coffman was detained, questioned and searched, police found two more handguns on his person. None of the weapons were registered, documents state. Coffman pleaded guilty and was sentenced in April to 46 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Guy Reffitt of Texas was charged with bringing a handgun onto Capitol grounds. Court documents showed that Reffitt, reported to be a member of the Three Percenters militia group, told his family he brought his gun with him and that he and others ""stormed the Capitol."" A jury found Reffitt guilty of five felony charges in March, and he remains detained pending sentencing. Christopher Michael Alberts of Maryland also brought his handgun onto Capitol grounds. An officer saw that Alberts had a gun on his hip and alerted fellow officers. When Alberts tried to flee, officers detained him and recovered the loaded handgun, along with a separate magazine. He has been indicted on ten felony counts. In his conspiratorial documentary series ""Patriot Purge,"" Carlson featured Mark Ibrahim, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, and falsely claimed that Ibrahim was forced from his job and indicted for simply being near the Capitol protest.  But court documents show that Ibrahim had already submitted his intent to resign from the DEA weeks before Jan. 6 and was indicted because he brought a gun with him onto Capitol grounds and made false statements to federal agents. The number of people who carried firearms with them that day may not ever be fully accounted for because the majority of those involved in the siege weren’t arrested on-site but were tracked down by law enforcement days, weeks and months later. It’s also important to note that an insurrection is a violent uprising against the government, and the definition of ""armed"" is not legally limited to guns; it refers to any weapon used for defense or offense and as a means of protection. Other items used as weapons on Jan. 6 included bats, crutches, flagpoles, skateboards, fire extinguishers and chemical sprays. Carlson claimed that no one in the crowd on Jan. 6 was found with a firearm. That’s inaccurate. Many of those involved in the attack were armed, and several had guns that police later seized.

Dewhurst says NYPD force 'almost twice' the size of Border Patrol
","Asked whether Texas needs to follow Arizona’s lead and enact a hard-line immigration law, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said in a May 12 interview with the Texas Tribune that he was more interested in “a long-term solution” to illegal immigration: securing the border. Claiming the federal government had done “virtually nothing” to address the situation, Dewhurst said border operations conducted by “local sheriff’s departments, local police departments, the state and our federal partners” had taught the following lesson: “At the end of the day, [even with] all of the technology in the world, you need people.” To emphasize his personnel point, Dewhurst compared the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents to the number of police officers in the nation’s largest city, New York. “You’ve got almost twice as many cops in New York City as you do on our entire border,” Dewhurst said. “That’s nuts.”Nutty, maybe.But does Dewhurst's statement reflect reality?Answering our query, his office provided figures from the New York Police Department indicating that it has about 34,500 officers and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the Border Patrol has about 19,100 agents on the northern and southern U.S. borders. The Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection division of the federal Department of Homeland Security.We checked, and those figures stand up. The website for the New York Police Department says the agency's ""current uniformed strength is approximately 34,500."" And Steven Cribby, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the Border Patrol numbers about 20,000 -- 17,000 of whom are stationed on the U.S-Mexico border. An additional 2,100 employees are on the border with Canada, with the rest patrolling coastal waters, primarily near Puerto Rico. Counting only the border agents that work the southern and northern borders, the NYPD force is about 81 percent larger than the Border Patrol, almost twice the size, as Dewhurst says. (That calculation leaves out the Border Patrol agents who work coastal waters. If you add those, the New York force is 73 percent larger.) We wondered, though, if it's reasonable to compare cops working the nation's biggest city to officers monitoring our international borders. We put that question to several law enforcement and criminal justice experts, including Samuel Walker, professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. His assessment: ""The comparison of the NYPD and the Border Patrol is completely wrong, given their very different roles and working environments."" Walker's point, which we heard separately from other experts: The two organizations have dramatically different missions and environments. The New York Police Department responds to calls for service from the city’s more than 8 million residents and numerous visitors, while fighting all kinds of crime, in a dense urban area. In contrast, the experts said, the Border Patrol has much narrower responsibilities, which they have to fulfill across vast spaces -- much of it sparsely populated.Since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the agency’s primary mission has been to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country, Cribby said. Agents are also tasked with preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country illegally and stopping drug and human trafficking along the border between the legal ports of entry.Even comparing staffing levels of different police departments can be tricky. The usual basis for comparison is the number of sworn officers per 1,000 residents. Those ratios vary widely across the country and even from city to city. Based on the most recent numbers available, New York's ratio in 2008 was 4.3 officers per 1,000 residents; the national rate was 2.5.“It’s often like comparing apples to carburetors because there is so much difference in how departments use people,” said Craig Fraser, director of management services for the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit research and consulting group in Washington. In some cities, police officers do jobs that are performed by civilian personnel elsewhere. Some police departments have fewer officers because other local law enforcement agencies, like a sheriff’s office, pick up slack.It's even trickier to compare agencies with such different duties as the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department, as Dewhurst did.So where does all of this leave his statement?The lieutenant governor accurately characterizes the relative sizes of two law enforcement agencies -- the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department. He may have a point that the border needs more federal agents -- though there is disagreement over whether more boots on the ground will prevent illegal immigration -- but comparing the size of that force to the cops in the Big Apple is not a valid way to prove it.Because his comparison takes the numbers out of their proper context, we rate his statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D8F7E00>],/factchecks/2010/may/21/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-nypd-force-almost-twice-size-border-/

Republicans are vying against each other to challenge Reid, and the primary appears to have several front-runners: Sue Lowden, a casino executive and former state party chairperson; Danny Tarkanian, a businessman and former college basketball star; and Sharron Angle, a former state representative with support from the Tea Party Express, a national group associated with the movement. The Republican primary is set for June 8.

The ads we've reviewed from the primary contest have similar themes: Government is too big, Washington can't be trusted, and only a true conservative should get the Republican nomination.

Tarkanian's ad ""Insiders' Game"" sounds these themes in fairly dramatic fashion, using ominous music and flashy graphics, and manages to attack Lowden and Reid simultaneously.

""Washington power was always Harry Reid's dream. That's why he needed to be stopped. Sue Lowden? She helped Harry Reid rise to power.""

Lowden is then shown in a video clip, saying, ""I supported Harry Reid early on.""

""Sue Lowden gave Harry Reid's campaigns a thousand dollars in five different elections, helping his Senate dreams come true. Today Harry Reid's got his power, and Sue Lowden's worth millions. It's always an insiders' game,"" the ad concludes.

We couldn't get a response to our questions from the Lowden campaign, but we did call the Federal Election Commission to find out about Lowden's contributions.

She did donate to Harry Reid -- back in the 1980s. She gave him $2,000 in 1984, $1,000 in 1986, and $2,000 in 1989. The ad counts that as ""five different elections,"" because in 1984 and 1989, Lowden made donations of $1,000 each for the primary and the general. Her husband, casino executive Paul Lowden, also contributed $8,000 between 1982 and 1995.

She told the Nevada media that she and her husband supported Reid at one time, but not anymore. ""Early on in the '80s when he was independent, we did feel that he was representing Nevada,"" she said last year.

The ad implies -- but doesn't say explicitly -- that Lowden benefited from her support of Reid. The Tarkanian campaign points to a letter of recommendation that Reid wrote to the Illinois Gaming Board in 1992, expressing support for the Lowdens' casino operations, describing Reid's interactions with them during his time as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981. ""I have found them to be great assets to the state, and I have found them to be honest in all their dealings with me. I highly recommend Paul Lowden and his company,"" Reid wrote. (You can read the letter via the Las Vegas Sun website.)

Jon Ralston, a reporter and commentator on Nevada politics, pointed out in his own analysis of the ad that the Lowdens were wealthy before contributing to Reid's campaign, and that Reid raised plenty of money from other people.

Here, we're checking the statement from the Tarkanian campaign, that ""Sue Lowden gave Harry Reid's campaigns a thousand dollars in five different elections, helping his Senate dreams come true.""

The campaign is counting primary and general election contributions as donations for separate elections. You could argue that this was actually support for three elections, not five.

The ad also implies that this support helped Reid's ""rise to power,"" and obliquely hints that there was some sort of mutual benefit. There's not much in the record to support that. Still, because the statement we're checking here is about Lowden's campaign contributions, which are a matter of public record, we're rating this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EA9B700>],/factchecks/2010/may/21/danny-tarkanian/nevada-gop-senate-candidate-says-rival-was-democra/

Rick Scott, former healthcare CEO, faces questions about past
","With Republican Rick Scott pouring millions of dollars into his unconventional bid for governor, the front-runners from both major parties are beginning to take his candidacy seriously.Translation: They're attacking him.Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum and Democratic Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink are launching new criticisms against Scott and his former hospital company, Columbia/HCA. ""If Scott proposes the same accountability measures for Florida government that he used at Columbia/HCA, we'll have to back up the paddy wagon to the front door of the Capitol,"" Sink spokeswoman Kyra Jennings said in a May 18, 2010, press release. ""Florida simply can't trust someone who was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine.""Hours later McCollum campaign manager Matt Williams offered a second stinging critique.""The fact that Rick Scott is running for governor as a 'reformer' would be funny if it wasn't so outrageous,"" Williams said. ""This is a man who barely escaped imprisonment, whose failure in business has been portrayed on national news and around the world. He is an embarrassment.""We're going to be checking statements from both campaigns. We'll start with Sink's claim that Scott ""was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine.""On his campaign website, Scott admits HCA has paid $1.7 billion in fines as part of a federal settlement concerning fraudulent health care billing, so there's not much point in checking that.But we hadn't heard the claim that HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies.Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. In 1994, Scott's Columbia purchased HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies to form Columbia/HCA. When Scott resigned as CEO in 1997, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott's campaign says. The company employed more than 285,000 people.Now, about why Scott left Columbia/HCA in 1997.That year, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. The scope of the investigation at first was unclear; even Scott said he didn't know what the U.S. Justice Department was looking for.But it later became apparent that the investigation focused on whether Columbia bilked Medicare and Medicaid.Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public and before the level of fraud became known. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy.Was he forced out as Sink claims? It's hard to tell. We don't know what happened in Columbia's board of directors meeting back in July 1997. So we have to go on news accounts from that time.USA Today put it this way: ""Under pressure from his board of directors, Columbia CEO Richard Scott quit Friday.""The St. Petersburg Times: ""The top two executives at Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. resigned Friday under pressure from an increasingly hostile board."" Other articles used the words ""amid pressure,"" or ""ousted"" to describe Scott's departure. Scott campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Scott left Columbia/HCA over a disagreement on how to handle the fraud investigation. ""There was a disagreement on how to move forward in light of the investigation and he and the company parted ways,"" Baker said. ""The board wanted to settle the fines and Rick took the position that the courts ultimately did, which was that there could be honest disagreement over how the regulations were interpreted."" In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced what it called the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history when Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties.Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement: The government settled a second series of claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The claims were largely related to additional allegations of fraud. The combination of the two settlements is how Sink, Scott and others reach the $1.7 billion figure.But none of that speaks directly to the fact cited in the Sink statement, that HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies in connection with the fraud case.The Sink campaign referred us to a December 2002 New York Times article. Indeed, the article said that in 2000 the hospital chain agreed to plead guilty to 14 separate felonies. But that's an article talking about a 2000 event. There were no stories from 2000 that referenced Columbia/HCA and 14 felonies.So we went to the Department of Justice looking for help.There we unearthed the original press release. Dated Dec. 14, 2000, the release highlights the record $840 million settlement agreed to between HCA and the Department of Justice.""Health care fraud impacts every American citizen. When a company defrauds our nation's health care programs, it takes money out of the pockets of the American taxpayers. It is wrong,"" then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in the release. ""This investigation has been the largest multi-agency investigation of a health care provider ever undertaken by the U.S. and reflects our commitment to vigorously pursuing all types of health care fraud schemes.""The release spells out the settlement, including specific payouts. It also details deals in the settlement of pending criminal cases. From the release:Southern District of Florida (Miami) -- Columbia Homecare Group Inc., a subsidiary of Columbia, will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and to violate the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute involving its fraudulent business in the purchase and operation of home health agencies and fraudulent billing of Medicare for management and personnel costs. The criminal fine is $3.36 million;Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta) -- Columbia Homecare Inc. will plead guilty to one count of violating the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute related to purchase of home health agencies. The criminal fine is $3.36 million;Department of Justice Criminal Fraud Section -- Another subsidiary, Columbia Management Companies Inc., will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and to make and use false writings and documents in connection with its fraudulent ""upcoding"" of bills to Medicare for patients diagnosed with certain types of pneumonia. The criminal fine is $27.5 million. This investigation was based in Nashville, Tennessee;Middle District of Florida (Tampa) -- Columbia Homecare Group will plead guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and one count of conspiracy to violate the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute in connection with the purchase and operation of home health agencies. The criminal fine is $8.4 million. Also, Columbia Management Companies will plead guilty to eight counts of making false statements to the U.S. in connection with the submission of false cost reports to Medicare. The fine amount is $22.6 million; and,Western District of Texas (El Paso) -- Columbia Homecare Group will plead to a conspiracy to pay kickbacks and other monetary benefits to doctors in violation of the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute. The criminal fine is $30.1 million.A couple of important notes. The actual plea deals were arranged with HCA subsidiaries and not the hospital chain itself. That was done so HCA could continue to participate in the Medicare program. Also, all of the charges deal with corporate criminal liability. Scott wasn't charged individually, and the plea deal was struck after Scott already had left the company.Secondly, we noticed how the discussion regarding the El Paso charge was different than in the other four jurisdictions. But based on the size of the fine, $30.1 million, we feel safe assuming there was at least one count agreed to as part of the settlement.Adding that in with the others indeed adds up to 14. In interviews, Scott accepts responsibility for the problems at Columbia/HCA, but denies direct knowledge of the fraud. ""There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient,'' Scott told the St. Petersburg Times this month. ""I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader."" In its claim, the Sink campaign says Scott ""was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine."" Scott's former company, Columbia/HCA, did plead guilty to 14 felony charges stemming from a massive federal fraud investigation, and Scott himself admits the company wound up paying $1.7 billion in fines. Whether Scott was forced to resign or not is something of an HR employment trick, but  media accounts certainly suggest the company's board of directors was under pressure from shareholders to shake things up. That's enough to rate Sink's claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EA01B00>],/factchecks/2010/may/20/alex-sink/rick-scott-healthcare-ceo-faces-questions-a/

Whitman accuses Poizner of 14 percent budget increase
","The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two frontrunners for the GOP nomination.One recurring theme in numerous Whitman ads is that Poizner presided over a big increase in the insurance department budget. The implication was that his fiscal skills aren't up to the task of easing the state's deep budget crisis -- an argument especially potent for many in the Republican base who will be voting in the primary. The charges about Poizner's stewardship of the department are similar, but the particular ad we'll be checking tells viewers that Poizner ""increased his department's budget nearly 14 percent.""The numbers we found do not support that claim.Poizner was elected to his post in November 2006 and took the reins of his department in January 2007. Given how the California budget works, the last budget completely assembled by his predecessor, John Garamendi, was the 2006-2007 budget. Work on the following fiscal year's budget, for 2007-2008, was begun under Garamendi, but Poizner had a chance to put his stamp on it after he took office. And the budget after that, 2008-2009, was entirely Poizner's.Meanwhile, until July 1 -- the start of the new fiscal year -- we're still in the 2009-2010 fiscal year.This provides us with a wealth of possible data points to compare. Should you use Garamendi's last solo budget as the basis for comparison? Or the budget the two men effectively shared?And at the other end of the comparison, do you use the final year for which we have a ""closed-books"" number (which would be 2008-2009) or do you use an estimate of the current year's budget, even though the numbers might eventually change due to late revisions?We ran all the possible combinations and found that the changes ranged from an increase of three-tenths of a percent to an increase of 9.4 percent. None of them reach 14 percent.So how did the Whitman campaign come up with the 14 percent figure? It started with the 2005-2006 budget year and stopped with the 2008-2009 budget year. Using those years produced an increase of 13.5 percent or, rounding up, 14 percent.While one can make a case for using the end date of 2008-2009 (that's the last closed-books year), it doesn't make sense at all to begin the calculation with 2005-2006. The budget increase that occurred between 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 was entirley under Garamendi's control, not Poizner's.The Poizner camp points out another factor. A portion of the insurance department's budget consists of funds for local law enforcement to pursue insurance fraud. These funds are determined by a formula, and Poizner has no control over them. We also ran the numbers for the remainder -- essentially, the department's operating budget -- and found that the changes ranged from a 6.2 percent increase to a 7.3 percent decrease. Once again, none was close to 14 percent. A final point: Poizner's department is not funded by general revenues, but rather by fees and penalties imposed on the insurance industry. So the money doesn't exactly revert back to taxpayers if it isn't spent. Nor, for that matter, does it go back to the insurance companies. Rather, it goes back into the insurance fund as reserves that can be spent in the future.We won't go so far as to confirm that Poizner actually presided over a shrinking budget, as his camp has claimed. Even if you just stick to the more limited operating budget under his control, there are credible ways to come up with a modest increase, just as there are ways to come up with a decrease. We also won't wade into the question -- tussled over by the two camps -- of whether Poizner or Schwarzenegger should get the credit for the department's budgetary reductions in the past year or two, since that's not relevant to the specific claim we're addressing here. What is clear to us is that no plausible calculation approaches the 14 percent figure that Whitman has cited repeatedly in her ads. So we rule her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D9BDB80>],/factchecks/2010/may/20/meg-whitman/whitman-accuses-poizner-14-percent-budget-increase/

Poizner says Whitman supported liberal icon Barbara Boxer
","The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two GOP frontrunners for the nomination.One ad, aired by Poizner beginning in April, argues that Whitman ""contributed to, and campaigned, for"" Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer -- a serious failing to those in the GOP primary electorate, who view the liberal Boxer as an ideological nemesis.The part about contributing to Boxer is easy enough to check. A search through the campaign donor database of the Federal Election Commission shows that Whitman made three donations totaling $8,000 to entities linked to Boxer, all in November 2003.The question of whether Whitman campaigned for Boxer is a bit more complicated. There's no question that she lent her name to Boxer's cause. Whitman joined 14 other Silicon Valley executives -- including John Chambers of Cisco, venture capitalist John Doerr and Chuck Geschke, co-founder of Adobe Systems -- in signing a letter written on ""Barbara Boxer for Senate"" letterhead dated April 30, 2003.In what was labeled ""An Open Letter to California’s Technology Community,"" the signers of the letter wrote, ""We ask you to join us in supporting U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer in her campaign for re-election in 2004. Senator Boxer is a dynamic and courageous leader for high technology and biotechnology communities, and she is making a difference for us every day.""The campaign has argued since last fall that Whitman supported Boxer for pragmatic reasons, in order to help her company.“As CEO of an online commerce leader, Meg backed Sen. Boxer because of her efforts with Republican Sen. George Allen to fight taxes on the Internet,"" said Dan Comstock, a spokesman for the Whitman campaign. Boxer actually wasn't alone in that stance: In a Sacramento Bee column, senior editor Dan Morain wrote that all of Boxer's Republican opponents that year joined Boxer in opposing the tax.Still, it's clear that Whitman not only supported Boxer financially but also by lending her name. Does that count as having ""campaigned for her""?We'd bet that most people would think the definition of ""campaigning for"" a candidate means to stump with them, canvass neighborhoods, make fundraising phone calls or speak to audiences on the behalf. Signing on to a letter, by contrast, is a more passive kind of support, something closer to an endorsement statement.The Whitman campaign said she did nothing more active for Boxer than to sign the letter, and no evidence has surfaced to contradict that. The closest she came in the letter to ""campaigning"" was writing, ""Join our effort to keep Senator Boxer in the U.S. Senate by adding your name to the growing list of her supporters in the high-tech community.""Ultimately, whether that constitutes ""campaigning"" is a judgment call, and our view is that it probably would have been more appropriate for the Poizner campaign to have used the word ""endorsed"" rather than ""campaigned."" But it's unquestionable that Whitman supported Boxer financially and rhetorically in 2003, so on balance we rate Poizner's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EB7AC80>],/factchecks/2010/may/20/steve-poizner/poizner-says-whitman-supported-liberal-icon-barbar/
"['Agriculture', 'Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Todd Staples']","
Staples voted for allowing agency to require livestock owners to ""tag"" their animals, but later said he opposes ID mandate
","
At a Tea Party rally in El Paso on April 15, Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, beefed about the government poking where it doesn't belong. 
""America's farmers and ranchers have seen firsthand just how quickly a big, intrusive government really can be,"" said Staples, a Republican who seeks re-election. ""And it starts with overzealous environmental lawyers abusing the Endangered Species Act and depriving people of the use of their own property. It includes bureaucrats who try to mandate that you put a $5 microchip in the ear of a $70 goat. That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?"" 
Crowd members laughed, but Hank Gilbert, the Democratic nominee for ag commissioner, later accused Staples of misleading voters about his record on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The federal program aimed to prevent outbreaks of animal disease by tracking individual livestock, or in the case of pigs and poultry, groups of animals, using a radio frequency ear tag with an electronic identification number (as opposed to a microchip inserted into the animal's ear). 
President George W. Bush's administration started developing the program in 2004 after the discovery in Washington state of a cow infected with mad cow disease — a degenerative brain disorder that can lead to animal deaths and contaminate the food supply. Three cases of infected cows have been identified in the United States, including one in Texas in June 2005. 
When the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced its timeline for the program in April 2005, livestock owners would have been required to register their ""premises"" and animals by January 2008 and required to report their animals' movements around the state by 2009. The USDA later changed its mind about that, but in the meantime Texas had taken steps to address the issue of animal ID. 
Enter Gilbert, who now seeks to remind voters of that history. In a May 13 press release, Gilbert said that no matter what Staples says lately, the record shows he previously supported the NAIS. ""He was for it, he voted for it, and he did nothing whatsoever to stop it when he was on the front lines in the (Texas) Senate,"" Gilbert said. 
Did Staples flip-flop on the cow chip? 
Gilbert's campaign pointed to February 2005 legislation revising the state's agriculture code by allowing the Texas Animal Health Commission to develop an animal identification program. To wit: ""In order to provide for disease control and enhance the ability to trace disease-infected animals or animals that have been exposed to disease, the commission may develop and implement an animal identification program that is consistent with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Animal Identification System."" 
Minutes of two House hearings show representatives from the Texas Farm Bureau, Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association and the Texas Cattle Feeders Association endorsed the proposal, which sailed through committee and cleared the House with only one vote recorded in opposition. 
Prior to the Senate vote, the Senate Committee on Natural Resources, of which Staples was a member, also heard public testimony. A Burnet rancher was the only witness recorded against the bill, according to a list of people who testified at the hearing. Committee members unanimously advanced the bill to the Senate, though Staples was absent from the hearing and action. Next, it was placed on the Senate's Local and Uncontested Calendar, an indication it had drawn no senatorial objections. Like other proposals on that calendar, it passed with all senators, including Staples, marked as voting ""aye."" 
The bill authorized the commission to require livestock owners to pay a fee to register their ""premises"" with an official ID number by a commission-set deadline. The commission could also tell owners to tag their livestock individually. Finally, the commission was permitted to levy fines for failure to comply. 
Does that mean, as Gilbert implies, that Texas lawmakers passed a bill that created a mandatory animal ID program? 
Not exactly. 
In 2005, responding to the witness who testified against the proposal, Sen. Mike Jackson, R-Pasadena, who carried the measure in the upper chamber, said: ""You are aware that this is a permissive bill that says the department may develop a program? It does not say that they shall do it, and the reason that it says that is because the federal government is going to come down here and tell us what to do in another year or two years... that's kind of the premise on why this thing is done."" 
Bill Powers, the commission's governmental relations coordinator, also testified, saying: ""What this legislation does is gives the animal health commission the authority to set up and develop a premises and animal identification program so when the federal program becomes mandatory, we're ready to go."" 
In 2006, commission members were poised to vote on the first phase of the program, which required livestock owners to register their premises. They backed off, however, in the face of protests by farmers and ranchers, who said it was an unfair tax. A second phase — never implemented — was to require tagging of individual animals. 
Meanwhile, the USDA was having problems with the federal animal ID program. In November 2006, the USDA backpedaled on its initiative, making it voluntary only. Farmers and ranchers still objected and this February, the Obama administration scrapped the animal ID program in favor of a new one that would only tag livestock being moved between states. 
Under the Texas law, the commission could still mandate that livestock owners identify and track their animals. Yet Gene Snelson, the commission's general counsel, told us that it won't act until the USDA defines its new program. 
And where does that leave Staples, who voted for the law? 
We sought to interview Staples; he wasn't available. Earlier, Cody McGregor, Staples' campaign manager, said: ""Commissioner Staples has stated his opposition to mandatory animal identification as recently as 2009 when he authored a letter to the USDA outlining the burden it would place on the agriculture community and Texas taxpayers."" 
Staples' May 20, 2009, letter to Tom Vilsack, the U.S. secretary of agriculture, states: ""I support the voluntary structure of animal identification... mandating animal identification for every animal owner in the United States would certainly have unintended consequences."" 
We found earlier instances of Staples objecting to a mandatory program — all from late 2006, when he was making his first race for ag commissioner. A sample: On Oct. 26, 2006, the ag weekly Country World quoted Staples saying, ""I oppose mandatory NAIS, and instead support a true voluntary program that allows for rapid trace back for animal diseases to ensure we maintain an open market for Texas animal products here and abroad."" 
Our judgment? 
As a senator, Staples voted for a proposal authorizing the state to develop an animal ID program in conjunction with a federal effort that seemed headed toward mandating tags. Significantly, the new law didn't require anyone to tag animals, though it empowered the animal health commission to issue a mandate. 
But save Staples' 2005 vote, which was in step with nearly every other legislator, he appears to have consistently opposed mandatory identification and tracking — which surely counts for something. 
Yet Staples' Senate vote counts as well. On the Flip-O-Meter, the contrast between his legislative action and his statements as a candidate and commissioner is a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000001A5506914C0>],/factchecks/2010/may/20/todd-staples/staples-voted-once-bill-authorized-another-agency-/

 Gov. Charlie Crist changes course on returning campaign donations
","Republicans banking on hopes that Gov. Charlie Crist would return donations they made when he was the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate were in for a rude awakening on May 12, 2010, when Crist made it clear he is keeping their money.  ""People gave to a good cause and we're going to spend it on a good cause,"" Crist told reporters outside of the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Office, after changing his registration from Republican to no party affiliation.""That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our message out and communicate with the people of Florida.""   The decision to hold on to nearly $10 million in campaign donations prompted cries that Crist was flip-flopping -- like this statement from the Republican Party of Florida, or this video on the campaign website for Republican senate candidate Marco Rubio.  While Crist may have earned a Full-Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for switching parties to bolster his Senate bid, we wondered whether Crist flip-flopped on giving refunds.  Let's start with what Crist said about refunding donations before he made his independent run official on April 29, 2010.  April 26, speaking to reporters in Miami.  Reporter: Will you return Republican donor money, Republican Party money since you received that money as a Republican?  Crist: You know, I think that's a decision that you have to make if you made a decision to go independent. I haven't made that decision yet.  Crist also had this response for St. Petersburg Times political editor Adam C. Smith when asked about refunding the donations:""Anybody has the right and the opportunity to ask. I think we spent it though.""  Next we'll look at what he said after announcing he would leave the Republican Party. Four days later, Crist appeared before a national audience on MSNBC's Morning Joe.  April 30, interview with Joe Scarborough on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe""  Scarborough: ""There are a lot of Republicans that are going to be asking you to give them the money back they gave you when you were running as a Republican, are you going to give them that money back or are you going to keep it?""  Crist: ""Well, No. 1, nobody's asked me yet. Not one person has asked me yet. And I think they realize that the reality is they gave it to my campaign, they gave it to me in order to espouse the ideas I believe in.""  Scarborough: ""If they ask for money back, will you give it back to them or will you keep it for the campaign?""  Crist: ""Ah, probably give it back to them. It's not that big a deal. What really matters is we're able to communicate our message.""  So it's pretty clear in those comments that Crist favors returning the donations. But before we make our Flip-O-Meter ruling, here's what Crist said about two weeks later:  May 12, speaking to reporters outside of the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections office when registering as no party affiliation.  ""People gave to a good cause and we're going to spend it on a good cause,"" Crist told reporters. ""That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our message out and communicate with the people of Florida.""   The same day, Crist campaign spokeswoman Michelle Todd made it clear to reporters that the money was non-refundable at this point.  ""We have never made an official statement before,"" Todd said, in an interview with Miami Herald political reporter Beth Reinhard. ""It is now the official statement. They donated to the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign and it's still the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign.""  Crist explained his decision a day later in a meeting with the St. Petersburg Times editorial board. He was asked if there would have been any downside to returning the money: ""Probably wouldn't be. ... I want it. I need it. I want to win.""  And one last note, as he opened his campaign headquarters in St. Petersburg on May 15, Crist was heckled by someone in the crowd who asked, ""What about the guys who gave you money when you were a Republican?!""  ""I'm going to keep it!"" Crist cheerfully responded, drawing roars of approval. (Watch the St. Petersburg Times' video here and check out his wink around 3:10 into the clip.) We should point out that Crist has returned some campaign donations, according to reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission, but for a different reason. He returned $76,250 in donations from the Fort Lauderdale law firm of Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein to a bankruptcy trustee, and another $9,600 from Rothstein and his wife to the U.S. Marshall's office. Also, Republican donor Al Hoffman got his $4,800 returned in February because of allegations of excessive spending by the Republican Party of Florida and Crist's hand-picked chairman Jim Greer. So in less than three weeks, Crist went from telling reporters he had yet to make a decision on running for indepedent, to running as an independent and ""probably"" giving the money back, to ""officially"" declaring he would keep the money.   Our main issue is Crist's use of the word ""probably"" during his Morning Joe interview. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines probably as ""insofar as seems reasonably true, factual, or to be expected: without much doubt.""  Crist said he would ""probably give it back to them,"" leading donors to believe that as the dictionary states it was ""to be expected"" or ""without much doubt"" that they would see some of their cash back from Crist.  We find Crist completely changed his position from entertaining the idea of giving the money back, to definitely not giving the money back. Our verdict: Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D935D40>],/factchecks/2010/may/19/charlie-crist/gov-charlie-crist-changes-course-keeping-campaign-/

California GOP candidate blames Obama health care bill for ""skyrocketing"" health costs
","The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two frontrunners for the nomination.One ad, aired by Poizner beginning in April, argues that ""like Schwarzenegger,"" Whitman ""will continue taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals. A skyrocketing cost under Obamacare.""We'll acknowledge some uncertainty about the statement's meaning because of its somewhat curious syntax. (Confusing matters further, the first sentence is read by a man, and the subsequent fragment by a woman.) However, we believe a reasonable person would interpret it to mean that a policy of continuing ""taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals"" would mean ""a skyrocketing cost"" due to the newly passed federal health care law.Whitman's press office did not respond to several inquiries from PolitiFact. The candidate's website does not directly address the question of whether she would continue ""taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals"" in the health care realm, though it does say that she advocates curbing state benefits for illegal immigrants in two other areas -- barring them from attending state-funded colleges and universities and preventing them from securing drivers' licenses.As for the question of whether the federal health care law will lead to skyrocketing costs, it would be incorrect to say that the new federal law is poised to increase California's costs directly. Written into the federal law is a clearly worded provision that prevents illegal immigrants from taking advantage of the law's benefits, such as the health care exchanges where uninsured Americans can compare plans and purchase coverage. But the Poizner campaign argues that the new law could have an indirect impact on California's deeply strained budget.The federal bill expands Medicaid eligibility to all Americans earning up to 133 percent of the poverty line. ""This will lead to more illegal immigrants enrolling, because California provides a version of Medicaid to illegal immigrants,"" Poizner's campaign press secretary, Bettina Inclán, told PolitiFact.But it's wrong to assume that illegal immigrants will qualify for full-blown Medicaid in California. In fact, the only entitlement they get from Medicaid is emergency care in hospitals, which is already mandatory under federal law and was not changed by the newly passed health care bill. These limited benefits are available to any illegal immigrant who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid were it not for their immigration status. (Illegal immigrants can also qualify for Medicaid benefits for long-term care, but it's not an entitlement -- coverage is provided only to the extent that legislators and the governor agree to fund the program, and there's no federal match.)Right now, emergency care for illegal immigrants in California is paid by the state and local government. To the extent that more illegal immigrants will now qualify for California's version of Medicaid (known as Medi-Cal) and use emergency hospital services, the only difference will be a shift of payment responsibility from one state or local account to another. (Whether the federal government will continue to pick up part of the cost for treating illegal immigrants using Medi-Cal -- as the federal government does today -- is unclear, given the new bill's language.)Take pregnancy care. There shouldn't be any new costs, because Medi-Cal already covers pregnant women up to 185 percent of the poverty line, which is more generous than the 133 percent in the federal law. As a result, undocumented immigrants who need emergency delivery would already have been on emergency Medicaid anyway.The Poizner campaign has a point that coverage of emergency care for illegal immigrants -- including pregnancy costs -- is not cheap, costing upwards of $800 million a year. And that amount seems destined to rise, judging by the recent history of inflation in the health care sector and perhaps an increase in the number of illegal immigrants residing in the state.So the state's burden for providing health care to illegal immigrants may go up, but it is not accurate for the Poizner campaign to blame that development either on the new federal health care law or on the Democratic president who pushed for it. The new federal law specifically prevents illegal immigrants from benefitting, and most of the additional indirect costs that might be expected from expanding the Medicaid rolls are already being paid in California by different state or local government accounts. For these reasons, the phrase ""a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare"" is a gross exaggeration. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E771240>],/factchecks/2010/may/19/steve-poizner/california-gop-candidate-blames-obama-health-care-/

Walt Minnick attacked on abortion issues tied to Obamacare
","During the heat of the federal health care debate earlier this year, abortion foes warned they would make legislators' votes on abortion provisions well known in future campaigns. Well that didn't take long. In a heated Idaho congressional race, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has launched a TV ad targeting incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Walt Minnick for several votes it claims supported taxpayer-funded abortions. Minnick is facing a challenge from two Republican contenders, Raul Labrador and Vaughn Ward. The ad uses one of those baseball pitch-trackers as the visual. Here's the voiceover: ""Is Walt Minnick voting your values? Minnick voted to allow direct taxpayer funding of abortion-on-demand in Washington. Strike One. Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare. Strike two. Then, Minnick voted to keep in place the extreme abortion provisions of Obamacare. Strike three. When it comes to representing our values, Walt Minnick's striking out. Call Minnick. And tell him to stop voting for taxpayer funded abortion."" We're betting we're going to see a lot of ads like this in the next six months. And so we're focusing on the most universal aspect of the ad, the claim that ""Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare."" Minnick is an abortion rights advocate, but the ad goes one step further, saying he voted repeatedly for taxpayer funding for abortions. First, a little bit about what those three votes were (and were not). 1) ""Minnick voted to allow direct taxpayer funding of abortion-on-demand in Washington."" This was a vote related specifically to the District of Columbia on July 16, 2009. A spending bill proposed removing special restrictions which had prohibited the District of Columbia city government from using local tax funds to pay for abortions for the poor (as all the 50 states are permitted to do). Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., offered an amendment to keep the restriction. The amendment was blocked by a narrow 219-208 vote; and Minnick was among those who voted against allowing the amendment to move forward. The bill did not direct federal tax dollars to cover abortions. It gave city legislators the power to decide if they want to steer local tax dollars toward abortion services. 2) ""Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare."" This relates to the much-publicized Stupak Amendment offered to the House version of the massive health care reform bill in the fall of 2009. Championed by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., the amendment took a hard line on abortion, barring anyone who accepted federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment would have let people choose a plan with abortion coverage if they paid for it without using federal subsidies. Minnick voted against the Stupak amendment, but it passed and was part of the health care bill that originally passed in the House. 3) ""Minnick voted to keep in place the extreme abortion provisions of Obamacare."" The Senate version of the health care reform package took a different tack on abortion. The Senate language, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., allowed companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But the provision included detailed measures to ensure federal tax dollars would not be used to fund abortion services. When the Senate version of the bill came back to the House for consideration, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., sought to have the bill changed to reflect the earlier Stupak language. That effort failed, and Minnick was among those who killed it. But Minnick ultimately voted against the health care bill. He's a member of the House Blue Dog coalition. His vote against the health care bill, along with his vote against the economic stimulus package, goes a long way toward explaining why he was the lone Democrat endorsed by the Tea Party Express, a national group that organized a tour this spring featuring Sarah Palin, Joe the Plumber Wurzelbacher and others. Minnick is also a consistent abortion rights supporter. In 2009, NARAL Pro-Choice America gave him a 100 percent rating. But the charge in the ad is not just that Minnick supports abortion rights, it's that he voted to ""let the government fund abortion under Obamacare"" -- Strike Two in the ad. On Nov. 7, 2009, Minnick issued a press release explaining his vote against the Stupak Amendment: ""I believe abortion should be safe, legal and rare, and that a decision on the issue can be made only by a woman, her family, her doctor and her pastor. ""I do not want a federal judge overruling that decision. I do not want a government bureaucrat denying a medical procedure ordered by a woman’s physician. I do not want this Congress to give an anonymous insurance executive an excuse to gut coverage for women's health. ""One of the reasons I oppose the House health care bill is that I do not believe the federal government should be making health care decisions for Americans. It is also why I oppose this amendment."" The assumption made in the ad is that a vote against the Stupak Amendment was a vote to let the government fund abortion. We explored that issue in depth during the health care debate and concluded similar claims were inaccurate. The alternative in play prior to the Stupak Amendment was to make abortion coverage available in private plans participating in the exchange, but requiring that such services be paid through patient premiums, not federal tax dollars. The version of the bill that passed the Senate also allowed companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill required that anyone who selected a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. Before signing off on that abortion language, Stupak convinced President Barack Obama to issue an executive order providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. And Stupak, who up until that point had been the champion of the abortion foes' position, declared ""There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation."" That's where things stood when the third vote mentioned in the ad came up. So let's review: The first vote mentioned in the ad was not exactly a vote for taxpayer-funded abortion, though that may be its result. The bill allowed District of Columbia city government to steer local tax dollars toward abortion services for the poor. But that would be the call of local officials in D.C., and it wouldn't result in federal tax dollars going to abortion. The other two votes relate to ""Obamacare."" Again, Minnick cast the votes cited in the ad, but ultimately voted against the health care bill. Moreover, we think it's inaccurate to claim that Minnick's vote against the Stupak Amendment was a vote to ""let the government fund abortion under Obamacare."" The Stupak Amendment certainly took a harder line on the abortion issue, barring those who accepted federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage. It's fair to say the Stupak amendment would have kept federal tax dollars from subsidizing abortions. But that doesn't mean that, conversely, a vote against it therefore allowed it. The alternative was to make abortion services available in health care exchanges, but paid entirely with patient premiums, not tax dollars. And so we rule the claim in the NRCC ad False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E74A540>],/factchecks/2010/may/19/national-republican-congressional-committee/walt-minnick-attacked-abortion-issues-tied-obamaca/

Democrat Lainey Melnick says Rep. Lamar Smith, friend to Wall Street, backed 2008 bailout but opposes vital financial reforms
","Democrat Lainey Melnick of Austin, challenging GOP U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio in November, casts Smith as a pal to monied interests who opposes crucial efforts to reform the nation’s financial sector. In an April 23 e-mail blast, Melnick writes: ""Not only did he support his Wall Street friends by offering them the $700 billion Wall Street bailout, but now he is standing in the way of reforms that would assure these bailouts would never happen again."" We wondered if her sally holds up. Melnick told us she based her ""Wall Street friends"" description on research posted online by the independent Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. We trolled the information that Melnick recommended and confirmed that Smith has received donations from heavy-hitter interests including Ernst & Young, Bank of America and the American Bankers Association. A snapshot: Since 1989, Smith has fielded $43,000 in donations from the bankers association, including $6,000 for this November’s election. In the same period, though, four other House Republicans from Texas, topped by Rep. Sam Johnson, received more from the group. Smith said in an e-mail: ""The most important factor in the way I vote is what is best for the country, not contributions ...Even if (as Melnick says) the American Bankers Association is my seventh-largest contributor, what difference does it make? In the end, it’s listening to my constituents and representing their interests that keeps me getting re-elected."" Next: Did Smith support the $700 billion emergency package approved by Congress amid the economic tumult of late 2008? Yes, on Oct. 3, 2008, Smith was among 91 Republicans to vote ""aye"" while 108 GOP members voted ""nay."" Smith said then: ""We are facing the economic equivalent of a cattle stampede. To stop a stampede, you have to act quickly and decisively and get ahead of the herd to turn it. This plan, while not perfect, does that... I believe the plan will stabilize the economy, strengthen home values and prevent a devastating recession."" Like Smith, most House Democrats voted to concur with Senate amendments to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program. And is Smith now standing in the way of reforms, as Melnick says? In her e-mail, Melnick cites Smith’s Dec. 11 vote against the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009, which was opposed that day by every voting House Republican and 27 Democrats, according to the roll call. The measure advanced to the Senate by a 223-202 vote. Two days before the vote, Smith told colleagues the 2008 financial crisis was caused by government intervention in the economy. He singled out that year’s bailout of Bear Stearns, which happened before the nation’s financial markets plunged into disarray, and the federal rescue of AIG, which was saved by an interagency intervention before Congress (including Smith) signed off on the $700 billion rescue package. Smith said the recent Democratic-steered House plan ""provides super-sized tools for ever-more invasive government control of the economy"" while failing to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored companies that are the biggest purchasers of mortgage-backed securities and have received billions of dollars in government assistance. Smith added that the plan institutionalizes billion-dollar bailouts by creating a way for government to wind down the liabilities of big financial institutions. Some background: The financial proposal supported by the Democratic majority lately awaiting Senate action would grant the government additional authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds. It also would create a consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve to regulate financial products, and enable federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions teetering on collapse. Unresolved: Whether a final plan, if reached, includes a version of the House-adopted multibillion-dollar dissolution fund, to be created by assessments against the nation’s biggest financial firms. The fund could be tapped to liquidate entities in a crisis. Finally, would the House-approved measure assure that bailouts never recur, as Melnick says? Our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington found lacking such a claim by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Democratic senator from Nevada. Experts agreed the plan would give government significant tools to head off troubles, but wouldn’t—and, realistically, couldn’t—eliminate bailouts unless, say, the government proved willing to chance another Great Depression by ignoring the next massive crisis. We followed up with George Washington University law professor Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a close observer of congressional tussling over Wall Street issues. Generally, Wilmarth told us, Republicans including Smith have fairly criticized Democrats for failing to attack the failings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In turn, he said, Republicans tend to be too protective of Wall Street. The professor said Republican proposals outlawing bailouts reflect a desire by Wall Street firms not to be financially responsible for a rescue fund like the one advocated by Democrats. Such firms ""know they’re going to get bailouts; they’ve always gotten bailouts,"" Wilmarth said, but without such a fund, taxpayers will almost certainly be left paying the costs. Melnick said that, like us, she’s relied on experts to interpret the pending legislation. While she believes the Democratic proposal’s intent is to end bailouts, she said, ""the problem is, as the experts are saying, we can’t tie people’s hands if that is the only way out of a crisis. We need that possibility there… I should not have been so definitive in that (April 23) statement."" All in all, how does Melnick’s e-mail blast stand up? It’s missing a pivotal leg. Though she accurately recaps two of Smith’s votes on bills dealing with the financial sector, the Democratic-supported reform legislation won’t -- as Melnick acknowledges -- end bailouts. Also, Smith’s campaign coffers have benefited from contributions from the financial sector, yet that’s a charge that could be leveled against many members including Texans who have fielded more in such donations. We rate Melnick’s statement as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DF6A2C0>],/factchecks/2010/may/19/lainey-melnick/democrat-lainey-melnick-says-rep-lamar-smith-frien/

In California race, Whitman says Poizner donated to Gore recount
","The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two frontrunners for the nomination.One ad, aired by Whitman beginning in midMay, attacks Poizner's fitness to be the Republican nominee in part by charging that he gave $10,000 to the 2000 presidential recount effort of Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, the Democratic nominees for president and vice president. The ad asks, ""How liberal is Steve Poizner?"" then answers its own question by proposing a litany of evidence, including the charge that Poizner ""gave $10,000 to Al Gore's recount.""The Poizner camp concedes that a federal disclosure form does indeed show that the Gore account received a $10,000 check signed by Poizner, whom the federal form identifies as an employee of the high-tech company Qualcomm. Qualcomm had earlier purchased Poizner's Silicon Vallley startup, SnapTrack Inc. Technically, the donation was made to a Democratic National Committee affiliate, but the campaign did not challenge the ad's description of the donation as being intended for the recount.However, the Poizner campaign has consistently argued that the check (as well as a separate $1,000 check made out to Gore 2000 Inc.) was written on a joint account and actually was intended to be a donation from his wife, Carol Poizner. ""As Steve has made clear numerous times over the last 10 years, his wife is a Democrat,"" Poizner campaign press secretary Bettina Inclán told PolitiFact. ""Steve’s wife supported Al Gore and contributions were made through their joint checking account. Steve voted for President Bush in 2000, worked for President Bush, and voted for President Bush again in 2004.""We wondered whether this explanation might be credible, so we checked in (no pun intended) with some campaign-finance experts.Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a campaign-finance advocacy group, and Brett Kappel, a campaign-finance and ethics counsel at the Washington, D.C., law firm Arent Fox, both agreed that it's possible that it could have happened as the campaign says it did.""It's true that Federal Election Commission regulations do require that campaigns attribute checks drawn on a joint checking account to the last person who signs the check, and (the Poizners) should have specified that the check was coming from her either by making a notation on the check or in an accompanying letter,"" Kappel said. ""But did you ever write a check for something your wife wanted? I have.""At the same time, Kappel added that it's fair to fault Poizner for acting sloppily if he did that, since people with political ambitions tend to be very careful about such matters.In addition, the forms for both donations list Steve Poizner's employer -- Qualcomm in one case and SnapTrack in the other. This suggests that either Poizner filed a supplementary form explaining the donation (a step that's recommended but not required under federal campaign finance law) or that staffers for Gore looked into the donation and had a reason to attribute the donation to him, as opposed to his wife, when they filed the disclosure form.It's worth noting that Whitman -- a fellow Silicon Valley business titan -- has also fielded accusations from the Poizner camp about her own past partisan lapses. We are separately fact-checking the claim that Whitman ""contributed to, and campaigned, for Barbara Boxer,"" California's liberal Democratic senator.It also bears mentioning that, for someone the campaign describes as still being ""a Democrat,"" Carol Poizner has donated an awful lot of money to the GOP. Ever since she gave $2,000 to Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., in 2001, she has, in her own name, donated almost $90,000 to such recipients as the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the Republican National Committee and the California Republican Party.Ultimately, there is no way to prove with any certainty whether Steve Poizner was simply writing a check for his wife, as he suggests. Experts tell us it could have happened that way. But under the law, the fact that he signed the check officially makes the donation his, and the listing of his employer, rather than his wife's, on the disclosure form provides additional evidence that he was the intended donor. So while the case isn't conclusive, its strongly suggestive. We rate the Whitman campaign's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D900E80>],/factchecks/2010/may/18/meg-whitman/california-race-whitman-says-poizner-donated-gore-/

U.S. Rep. John Mica and family have oil ties, Democrat claims
","A relatively unknown Democrat looking to unseat longtime Florida U.S. Rep. John Mica is using the Deepwater Horizon oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico as a way to play up Mica's family ties to the oil industry.Mica, R-Winter Park, has represented Florida's 7th Congressional District since 1993. The district, which covers the northeast coast of Florida, has been considered a safe seat for Republicans (John McCain carried the district by 7 percentage points in 2008).Democrat Heather Beaven, a Navy veteran, said in a May 12, 2010, e-mail to supporters that Mica's brother is a lobbyist for the oil industry and that his daughter represents an interest group that supports increased offshore drilling for oil and natural gas.""Brother of only Fla. lawmaker to support offshore drilling is an oil lobbyist,"" Beaven said in the e-mail, copying a headline from the Orlando Sentinel. Later, she said, ""John Mica's daughter represents the Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas and the Citizens Alliance for Energy Security in support of increased access to offshore oil & natural gas.""The e-mail includes other ties between Mica and the oil industry then asks ""Disgusted yet?"" An accompanying link directs supporters to Beaven's online campaign contribution page. In this item, we wanted to see if Beaven's description of Mica's family connections to the energy industry is accurate.Mica has been a longtime supporter of offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, advocating for drilling well before gas prices neared $4 a gallon in 2008. Mica was the lone member of the Florida Congressional delegation to not sign a letter in 2003 to stop the federal government from surveying Florida coastal waters for oil and natural gas. In 2006, the Palm Beach Post reported that Mica was only one of two Florida House members to vote to allow gas drilling within 9 miles of Florida's Gulf Coast. That measure failed.Even now, Mica touts on his campaign website that he scored a 100 percent rating on the ""Freedom From Oil Scorecard,"" published by the conservative political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.Mica maintained his support for offshore oil drilling in a May 13 statement provided to PolitiFact Florida. My position on drilling for gas and oil remain the same.  I have always advocated drilling based on sound science, technology and employing safe measures, taking into consideration depths and currents. Unfortunately most of the past restrictions on drilling have been based on politics rather than sound science and safe procedures.  Based on what has occurred in the Gulf, I would urge Congress to make certain that proper safeguards are required including a failsafe shutoff valve, and having a standby mechanism like the dome in place with tried and proven technology available before rather than after the fact.With 3,400 oil and 600 gas rigs already in the Gulf of Mexico, action on insuring against another disaster is important.  Furthermore, even if Florida has a 100, 125, 150 or 200 mile ban and other states and countries like Mexico allow close or deepwater rigs, our state can still remain at risk without these protective measures.  Now, onto his family.The brother Beaven is referring to in her e-mail is David Mica. He currently serves as executive director of the Florida Petroleum Council, a group that --- the name kind of gives it away --- supports increased offshore drilling.David Mica has called on the Florida Legislature to open up state waters as close as 3 miles offshore to oil and gas drilling, and has continued to push a pro-drilling position even after the Deepwater Horizon leak. As Beaven claimed, he also is a registered lobbyist in Florida.""We've got to keep our commitment to explore, develop, and produce oil and gas,"" David Mica told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in an article published April 30, 2010. ""You can't give up on technology.""And in the Florida Times-Union, he equated the leak to the airplane industry. ""At the end of the day, we can't stop flying airplanes when one crashes,"" Mica said.Mica's daughter, D'Anne Mica, is the founder of Mica Strategic Communications, a communications and public relations company in Winter Park. Among the clients listed on her website are Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas and Citizens Alliance for Energy Security.Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas was formed in 2004 by a group of chemical companies to push for, among other things, increased natural gas exploration. The group, however, is dormant. It hasn't been mentioned in a newspaper article since 2007 and we couldn't find the group's website, if it ever had one. A representive for PR firm Dutko Worldwide, which also has done work for Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas, said the group has not been operating for a few years. ""The Alliance is no longer together,"" said vice president Tracy Hammond. ""I don't believe it's been operating for a couple of years now.""  We couldn't find any reference to the other group -- Citizens Alliance for Energy Security -- outside of Beaven's e-mails, D'Anne Mica's client list and her online business profile.We called Mica Strategic Communications to see if the two groups remain clients, but the phone number appears to have been changed or disconnected. We got this message: ""TheOnStar subscriber you're trying to reach is unavailable."" And we couldn't find a Mica Strategic Communications listed in the Florida Department of State Division of Corporations. That leads us to believe the business may be dormant as well.In a January 2010 interview with ABC News, D'Anne Mica suggested that her business was still active, but did not discuss her energy clients. D'Anne Mica was being interviewed after being arrested for driving under the influence. After her arrest, questions surfaced about some of her PR work and how it may have overlapped with her father's congressional priorities.""My father has no idea what I do in my business,"" she told ABC News. ""And I have no idea what he does in his.""In every case, the Micas have denied any connection between their relationships and their work. That brings us back to Beaven's e-mail. In trying to use the Deepwater Horizon oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico as a way to play up John Mica's family ties to the oil industry, she claimed that Mica's brother is an oil lobbyist and that his daughter represents a group that promotes offshore oil and gas drilling.Mica's brother, David Mica, is currently a lobbyist and executive director of the Florida Petroleum Council. Mica's daughter, D'Anne Mica, once listed Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas as a PR client, a group that lobbied for increased natural gas drilling. The only real question is if D'Anne Mica currently represents the oil and gas group as Beaven suggests in her e-mail. On that point, there's slim evidence she does. The group hasn't been mentioned in a newspaper article since 2007, doesn't have an active website we can find and a person who worked for the alliance said they've been out of operation for a couple of years. Finding no additional supporting material, we rate Beaven's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EBFDA40>],/factchecks/2010/may/18/heather-beaven/us-rep-john-mica-family-oil-ties/

Rick Scott supports oil drilling
","The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has made offshore drilling an important issue in many Florida campaigns. In the governor's race, Democrat Alex Sink says that one of her Republican opponents, Rick Scott, wants to expand drilling. Sink campaign manager Jim Cassady wrote an e-mail May 15, 2010, that said: ""While we've been fighting to end drilling, neither of Alex's Republican opponents will support the amendment to ban drilling off Florida's coast -- Bill McCollum won't, and Rick Scott's even saying he wants more offshore drilling. We can't stand by and let a disaster like this happen again.""We were interested in the part of the claim about Scott. In the wake of the massive spill, is Scott arguing for more offshore drilling?Sink's campaign pointed us to Scott's website that includes his position on ""energy independence"": Energy Independence is not just critical to our economic security, it is also it crucial (sic) to our national security. We must stop being dependent on other countries for oil. We need to build more nuclear plants, invest in alternative fuels and drill off shore. But we must ensure that Florida’s beaches are protected. ... As we explore the expansion of domestic drilling in the U.S. we must ensure that we have sound policies in place that ensure the companies drilling are doing so in an environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards. ... Rick supports expansion of nuclear power, use of alternative fuels and off-shore drilling. Sink's campaign also sent us a May 11 Palm Beach Post blog that said Scott would oppose a constitutional ban on offshore drilling. Some political leaders have called for a ballot measure prohibiting drilling within 10 miles of Florida's coast.""We need to protect our beaches, break our dependency on foreign oil and hold oil companies accountable when there are problems,"" Scott said, according to the blog. ""As governor, I’ll look to strike a balance between responsible exploration that takes every precaution and is far enough from our shores while holding oil companies accountable for their mistakes.""We asked Scott's campaign if he supports an expansion of oil drilling. Spokesperson Jennifer Baker said that Scott's statement about drilling was posted on his website before the April 20 spill but was later clarified to add the phrase calling for policies to allow drilling in an ""environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards."" That phrase was included on his website as of May 17, 2010. She said Scott supports drilling on the condition that it be done safely.""He states that it must be done safely, we need to figure out what went wrong with the BP spill and hold the people responsible accountable and in the future drilling should be part of a comprehensive energy strategy that makes the United States energy independent,"" Baker said.She sent us a link to an interview on WIOD News Radio in which he was asked if he wanted to continue to drill.""I believe we can come up with a way to drill with the right precautions,'' Scott said. Scott's campaign doesn't dispute that he is in favor of offshore drilling and against a constitutional ban -- as long as the drilling is done safely. Certainly any candidate or politician who supports drilling wants it done safely -- we don't believe that makes Sink's claim inaccurate. Sink's campaign said that Scott wants ""even more offshore drilling'' -- and that's an accurate account of what he's said. We find this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DC4DFC0>],/factchecks/2010/may/18/alex-sink/rick-scott-supports-oil-drilling/

Elena Kagan law articles not so easy to count
","Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan has never been a judge, which means there are no legal opinions to analyze. So her scholarly writing has taken on heightened prominence.

Kagan's writings have drawn an interesting mix of reviews. Some people say her record is highly regarded and substantial, while others say it's embarrassingly puny. One of the nay-sayers is New York Times columnist David Brooks, who wrote that Kagan has been so cautious and strategic in cultivating her career that she's, well, boring.

As evidence of this, Brooks cited her academic record:

""She has become a legal scholar without the interest scholars normally have in the contest of ideas. She's shown relatively little interest in coming up with new theories or influencing public debate.

""Her publication record is scant and carefully nonideological. She has published five scholarly review articles, mostly on administrative law and the First Amendment. These articles were mostly on technical and procedural issues.""

His description of her record caught our attention; we had read other reports that gave different numbers for her scholarly output. SCOTUSBlog, a respected blog about the Supreme Court, said Kagan wrote six major articles, while Eugene Volokh, a respected law professor from University of California at Los Angeles, described her publications on his blog The Volokh Conspiracy as ""four major articles"" and ""three shorter but still substantial pieces,"" which would be seven pieces.

We set out to determine how many articles Kagan had written and what they were about. We soon discovered is that counting scholarly articles is not an exact science.

When Kagan was being confirmed as President Obama's solicitor general, she submitted a list of her publications to the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee. That list is lengthy, citing 19 separate pieces. Some of these are obviously not ""scholarly review articles,"" such as short introductions for longer works, or memorials of people who have died. We did find five pieces of Kagan's that seem pretty indisputably to be original, scholarly publications: • ""Chevron's Nondelegation Doctrine,"" Supreme Court Review, 2001 (co-written with David J. Barron) • ""Presidential Administration,"" Harvard Law Review, 2001 • ""Regulation of Hate Speech and Pornography after R.A.V.,"" University of Chicago Law Review 1993 • ""The Changing Faces of First Amendment Neutrality: R.A.V. v St. Paul, Rust v Sullivan, and the Problem of Content-Based Underinclusion,"" Supreme Court Review, 1992 • ""Private Speech, Public Purpose: The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine,"" University of Chicago Law Review, 1996 There's also a fairly significant piece that we don't include above only because it's written in response to another law professor's article and might not be considered purely original. But it is substantial and it did appear in a respected law review. It is included in the SCOTUSblog tally. • ""When A Speech Code Is A Speech Code: The Stanford Policy and the Theory of Incidental Restraints,"" University of California at Davis Law Review, 1996 There are also two lengthy book reviews Kagan wrote for law reviews. Volokh counts the first one. • ""Confirmation Messes, Old and New,"" University of Chicago Law Review, 1993 • ""A Libel Story: Sullivan Then and Now,"" Law and Social Inquiry 1993 We consulted with two law professors who served on hiring committees for law schools to get additional perspective on how law professors count scholarly articles.

""It's an interesting question, and there's a good deal of disagreement,"" said Richard Friedman, a professor of law at the highly regarded University of Michigan Law School. Hiring committees look for work that has had ""scholarly impact,"" Friedman said, which usually means other scholars or judges notice the work and comment on it.

""Some book reviews are pretty ambitious theoretically,"" Friedman said. ""I don't think there should be a hard, fast rule that says, 'Oh it's a book review, it doesn't count.' ... But a book review is probably going to count less.""

Another law professor said productivity is also a top concern for hiring committees.

""The usual contours the discussion takes are over how much people have done over a period of time,"" said George Rutherglen, a professor at the highly rated University of Virginia Law School. ""You need to ask how long she was working as a law professor full-time.""

This is particularly pertinent in Kagan's case, because she has not been a full-time scholar for much of her career. She currently serves as solicitor general, the attorney who argues the government's cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Before that, she was the dean of the Harvard Law School, and she also served as an attorney and adviser in the Clinton administration. Her career as a legal scholar was interrupted by the latter two positions. Deans are usually administrators and not expected to consistently publish major scholarly work, said both Friedman and Rutherglen.

Brooks also described Kagan's articles were ""mostly on technical or procedural issues.""

We reviewed Kagan's major articles to see if they seemed particularly procedural or technical from a lay person's perspective. One of them definitely did: ""Chevron's Nondelegation Doctrine"" is about how Congress delegates policy decisions to official agencies. ""Presidential Administration"" was also long but less than thrilling, and concerned how ""presidential control over administration can serve pro-regulatory objectives.""

We should note, however, that ""Presidential Administration"" has launched a fairly robust debate on the left about Kagan's views are on executive power. The blogger and civil rights attorney Glenn Greenwald has written that Kagan's article raises questions about her views in the wake of the George W. Bush's approach to executive power.  Greenwald acknowledged that Kagan wrote the article before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; he thinks she should answer questions about the article. But Greenwald still called the article ""definitely a major piece of scholarship.""

Kagan's three other major articles are about First Amendment law. ""Regulation of Hate Speech and Pornography after R.A.V.,"" ""The Changing Faces of First Amendment Neutrality,"" and ""Private Speech, Public Purpose"" are fairly interesting discussions of how courts should consider First Amendment cases, when government tries to do things like suppress hate speech or enforce abortion gag rules. R.A.V. was the pseudonym of a teenager convicted under a hate speech ordinance for burning a cross on the lawn of a black family. The Supreme Court found that the ordinance in question crossed the line from punishing behavior to punishing viewpoints. These articles did not seem particularly technical or procedural. Rutherglen praised these pieces as ""important contributions to the field,"" while Volokh wrote that the articles ""attack difficult and important problems.""

Her most readable piece was her book review, ""Confirmation Messes, Old and New,"" in which she argued that Supreme Court nominees should be more forthcoming about their legal views during confirmation hearings. (Yes, we're readying our Flip-O-Meter on this one, once her own hearings start.)

To be clear, whether Kagan's scholarly output should be considered substantial or scant is a legitimate area for debate and we're not trying to settle that question here. Instead, we wanted to know how much Kagan wrote and what she wrote about.

Brooks said she wrote five ""mostly technical and procedural"" scholarly review articles. We found that there are several different ways to calculate how many law review articles Kagan has written; and some legal experts offer higher numbers. Finally, if Brooks only counts five articles, at least three of those were about significant First Amendment issues with broad impact, which is at odds with his description of the articles as ""mostly technical or procedural."" So we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550682A80>],/factchecks/2010/may/17/david-brooks/elena-kagan-law-articles-not-so-easy-count/

Charlie Crist says people asking for refunds never donated
","Though he officially declared his ""independence"" by leaving the Republican Party on May 12, 2010, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist says he won't return money contributed to his U.S. Senate campaign while he was running as a Republican. ""People gave to a good cause, and we're going to spend it on a good cause,'' Crist said minutes after switching his voter registration. ""That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our message out and communicate with the people of Florida.'' The next day, in a wide-ranging interview with the editorial board of the St. Petersburg Times, the refund talk resurfaced. This time, Crist discussed a letter he received from 20 Republican heavyweights asking for refunds. He suggested that the letter was more a stunt than a sincere request. ""I got a letter from 20 people who said they wanted their money back, 14 never gave me a penny,"" Crist told the Times, adding, ""You gotta give it to me first before you can have the option."" We wanted to see if Crist is right. The letter in question actually is published on Marco Rubio's Senate campaign website. It reads in part: ""We helped to support, and yes to bankroll, your political career. For years you have been asking us for money. And for years we have put our names and credibility on the line by asking our friends to donate to you. Those days are over.""As part of your transition into this new phase of your political career, we respectfully request that you return every penny of donor money from every donor who asks for a refund. For those of us who have donated to your Senate campaign, you can start by refunding in full the contributions we have made.""Recent reports with the Federal Elections Commission indicate your campaign is sitting on a stockpile of approximately $7.6 million dollars in contributions.""Charlie, that is not your money."" The letter is signed by mainly Florida Republicans, including former Florida GOP Chairman Al Cardenas, Outback Steakhouse executive Chris Sullivan, Palm Beach County GOP chair Sid Dinerstein and former U.S. Ambassador to Portugal Al Hoffman. Palm Beach Post reporter Mike Bender quickly took the list of letter writers and compared it to the list of Charlie Crist's campaign contributors. He published the results of his analysis on the Post's political blog. The analysis showed that of the 20 people listed on the letter, only nine actually donated to Crist's Senate campaign, and of the nine -- Hoffman -- got his contributions back in February 2010 (Hoffman asked for his money back in February over allegations of excessive spending by the Republican Party of Florida and Crist's hand-picked chairman Jim Greer). PolitiFact Florida checked Bender's reporting by searching the Federal Election Commission's electronic campaign database and came up with the same number. Here's a list of the signers and how much they contributed to Crist's campaign. Hilton did donate $2,000 to Crist's 1998 Senate campaign. The Post reported that one of the 20 to sign the letter, Gay Gaines of Palm Beach, hasn’t donated to Crist in at least 15 years. She gave $2,400 this year to Rubio. Crist, in his statement to the St. Petersburg Times editorial board, is off a little bit by saying 14 of the 20 have asked for a refund. Actually, 11 never gave Crist ""a penny"" for his 2010 Senate campaign. And a 12th person had his money back before sending the letter to Crist. That's close enough, however, to rate Crist's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54F36DDC0>],/factchecks/2010/may/17/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-people-asking-refunds-never-don/

Democratic group credits Hispanic and African American population growth with pending leap in U.S. House seats for Texas
","Highlighting the 2011 Legislature’s job of redrawing congressional districts, Washington activist Matt Angle says Texas stands to gain three to four congressional seats thanks to the state's population growth from 2000 to 2010. That’s widely expected. Angle spices his April 29 e-mail blast for the Lone Star Project, the pro-Democratic effort he directs, by saying: “This increase in federal political clout is almost entirely due to the growth of the African American and Hispanic populations in Texas in virtually every region of the state.” A boom in black and brown residents is driving the pending expansion of congressional power? We sought to learn more. Some background: Relative population changes, as measured by each decennial census, determine whether states gain or lose seats in the 435-member House. Texas is poised to add to its 32 House seats because its population has grown at about twice the national pace. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates there were 24.3 million Texans in 2008, up 17 percent from 20.8 million residents in 2000. In contrast, the nation’s overall estimated growth from 2000 to 2008 was 8 percent. Here's how population affects congressional representation. First, every state gets one House seat. Then the remaining 385 seats are divvied up according to a formula that ultimately gives states with the most residents—California and Texas—the most seats. Angle, referencing the bureau’s estimates, said the state’s African American and Hispanic population increased by 29 percent since 2000 while the “rest of Texas” grew at around 8 percent. “Without the high growth rate of the Hispanic and African American populations,” Angle said, “Texas would have grown at the same rate as the United States and earned no additional congressional seats.” Next, Angle pointed to an April report by the Texas Legislative Council, which advises state legislators. The report includes maps showing that from 2000 to 2008, growth in the Hispanic and black populations outpaced the state’s overall growth in nearly every region. A map suggests the Anglo population exceeded the state's growth rate in 11 of 254 counties. “Over the past decade,” the report says, “the most significant change in the ethnic composition of the state population is the increasing proportion of Hispanics and the decreasing proportion of Anglos.” Hispanics increased from 32 percent of the population in 2000 to 36 percent in 2008, while Anglos fell from 53 percent to 47 percent. “The changes in the Black and Other proportions of the population are small by comparison,” the report says, with black residents amounting to 11 percent of the population both in 2000 and 2008. For outside perspective, we contacted Kimball Brace of Virginia-based Election Data Services, a consulting firm that specializes in reapportionment, redistricting and the census. In December, the firm issued a reapportionment analysis concluding Texas will gain three House seats, possibly four. Brace, looking over the census population estimates for Texas, told us he’d attribute the projected gain largely to Hispanic population growth and not to growth in African Americans. Election Data Services calculates that each House district in Texas will likely be home to 698,552 residents. Presuming that the state’s Hispanic and black population increases by one projected amount, 2.6 million, it’s correct to say the growth equates to nearly four new districts. We wondered if one could just as easily credit Hispanic plus white population growth for the new seats, by limiting the focus to raw population numbers. Our speculation? The census could show a raw increase in the white population that exceeds the numerical increase in African Americans. It goes to reason, then, that the white gains might justify an increase in congressional clout more than the black gains, at least by raw numbers. ""You are correct,"" Brace told us. ""In rank order, clearly Hispanic growth is giving (Texas) three out of the four (potential) seats."" Both Anglos and African Americans are less significant in that respect. Still, Brace said, other factors besides raw population will come into play when legislators draw districts. Those factors, he said, include relative growth rates of different racial segments, regional distribution of residents and to what degree different segments comprise more or less of the state's population than in 2000. His comments were a reminder that redistricting is a fascinating, complex process with future elections hanging in the balance. ""You have this attempt by all groups to push their particular story,"" Brace said. ""Republicans are going to say, 'Hey, we should get at least one (new seat).' Hispanics will say, 'We should get at least three.' African Americans will say, 'Hey we’re significant still'"" too.Ed Martin, a Democratic consultant versed in redistricting, said Angle's statement is correct for reasons including the reality that for now, population projections vary widely, while it's undisputed that the relative growth of the state's major population groups place Hispanics first, blacks second and Anglos a distant third.Martin said in an e-mail the ""reason Texas can overcome the relatively slow Anglo growth rate to get new seats is the much higher growth rate of Hispanics and African Americans, which far exceeds the national average."" Martin's comment prompted us to look at the proportional impact of the growth in black and Hispanic populations in excess of the expected national growth rate of 10 percent. We employed one of several 2010 population projections by the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center to estimate that population growth among black Texans could account for about 90,000, or 6 percent, of the residents fueling the state's congressional seat gains. Meantime, growth in Hispanic Texans in excess of the nation's growth rate could account for more than 1.5 million, or 94 percent, of the additional residents driving the gains. Martin cautioned against using any projection to reach conclusions. He said in an e-mail: ""Unless you gather a lot of projections and somehow average them out and make an informed decision about why a lot of smart people come up with different numbers, using any single projected raw number is not reliable."" In the end? We're persuaded that Hispanic growth alone stands to merit most credit for Texas gaining three to four additional House seats, but no one can say for certain until the census is complete. We rate the statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A55085DD00>],/factchecks/2010/may/17/lone-star-project/democratic-group-credits-hispanic-and-african-amer/
"['National', 'Kagan Nomination', 'Military', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Patrick Leahy']","
Sen. Leahy says military recruited every day Kagan was dean at Harvard Law School
","In a discussion of Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan on ABC's This Week on May 16, 2010, the back-and-forth between Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. the committee's ranking Republican, largely focused on Kagan's position on military recruitment while she was dean at Harvard Law School between 2003 and 2009. We looked at statements from each of the senators, and in this one, we're focusing on a claim from Leahy. ""This is like in Shakespeare, sound and fury signifying nothing,"" Leahy said. ""The recruiters were always on the Harvard campus. She's shown her respect for the veterans there. She every year on Veterans Day, she had a dinner for all the veterans and their families who were there at Harvard. Recruiting went on at Harvard every single day throughout the time she was there. She was trying to follow Harvard's policy. She was also trying to make sure that students who wanted to go in the military could."" Much has been made about Kagan's stance against military recruiters on the Harvard Law School campus. Kagan argued the military's 1993 ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy -- which denied entry to openly gay people -- put recruiters at odds with a longstanding university policy that required employers who wanted to recruit on campus through the school's Office of Career Services to sign a statement that they did not discriminate based on race, gender or sexual orientation. But the federal government has a policy -- the Solomon Amendment -- that precludes various forms of federal money from going to universities that do not provide the military the same access to students that they provide to other employers. And so, a year before Kagan took the reins at Harvard -- under threat of losing federal funds -- the university agreed to allow the military to recruit at Harvard Law through the regular channels, the Office of Career Services. For a time, Kagan toed the line on that school policy, though in 2003 she penned a letter to the law school community expressing her opposition to the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy: ""I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. The importance of the military to our society -- and the extraordinary service that members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- makes this discrimination more, not less, repugnant. The military's policy deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible. This is a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order. And it is a wrong that tears at the fabric of our own community, because some of our members cannot, while others can, devote their professional careers to their country."" And in 2005, after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit ruled in a case brought by an association of law schools that the Solomon Amendment was ""likely"" unconstitutional, Kagan barred military recruiters access to the Office of Career Services for a semester. But that didn't mean military recruiters were barred from campus altogether. Rather, at Kagan's suggestion, the military recruited through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a student organization (now called the Harvard Law School Armed Forces Association). And after that semester -- under another threat of losing funding from the federal government -- Kagan reversed course and again allowed the military to avail themselves of the Office of Career Services. So Leahy's argument is that even during the semester that Kagan barred military recruiters from using the Office of Career Services, the military was still allowed to recruit on campus through the school's student veterans association. Recruiting through the veterans association was the way things worked for years during her predecessor's tenure as dean. ""The symbolic effect of this special treatment of military recruiters was important, but the practical effect on recruiting logistics was minimal,"" wrote Robert C. Clark, a professor and dean at Harvard Law School from 1989 to 2003, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on May 11, 2010. After she barred military recruiters from using the Office of Career Services, Kagan asked the veterans association ""to facilitate some measure of interested student access to military representatives."" But a Feb. 18, 2005, letter from the Harvard Law School Veterans Association to the law school community suggests it wasn't exactly a seamless blip: ""After vigorous debate, we have decided to accept a limited interim role to assist fellow classmates who desire to investigate career opportunities as Judge Advocates or in other military endeavors,"" the letter said. The association agreed to establish an e-mail account where students could send confidential inquiries, and fellow students who have served in the different branches of the armed forces volunteered to ""share personal experiences, explain what a military commitment entails, and informally assist in navigating the joining process."" The association also agreed to accept and post e-mail notices from military recruiters visiting the area. ""Interviewers will be strongly encouraged to arrange for an off-campus location to conduct interviews and to send such notices no later than three weeks in advance of any area visit . . . ""We have declined interim options to establish formal liaison relationships, sponsor regular on-campus military recruiting fairs, coordinate interviews extensively, or perform other equivalent functions,"" the letter states. ""Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting events. Moreover, such copious involvement would dramatically constrict our ability to organize other, non-recruiting events. ""The above e-mail address falls short of duplicating the excellent assistance provided by the HLS Office of Career Services,"" the letter said. ""We sincerely hope, however, that it satisfies some needs of our interested classmates and that they feel entirely comfortable in approaching us as peers."" Leahy was technically accurate when he said ""recruiters were always on the Harvard campus."" For all but one semester, military recruiters were afforded the same access as any other company seeking to recruit Harvard Law students. And for the one semester Kagan barred military recruiters access to the Office of Career Services, military recruiters were still granted access to the campus via the student veterans association. But Leahy exaggerated when he said ""recruiting went on at Harvard every single day throughout the time she (Kagan) was there."" The comment suggests it was business as usual for military recruiters on the Harvard Law School campus. The letter from the student veterans association indicates that was not the case. The limitations described in the letter indicate the organization was not equipped or able to make sure that recruiting went on at Harvard ""every single day."" Leahy's comment also ignores some important context: namely, that there was a raging legal battle over the extent of the recruiting. And so we rule Leahy's comment Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E394B40>],/factchecks/2010/may/17/patrick-leahy/sen-leahy-says-military-recruited-every-day-kagan-/
