Romney says Barack Obama has no private sector experience
","
When Barack Obama was seeking the presidency in 2008, Republicans frequently derided his career experience, saying it was limited to a scant four years in the U.S. Senate, some time in the Illinois Senate, and having been a ""community organizer"" in Chicago.

Today, with the unemployment seemingly stuck above 9 percent, the GOP is returning to that theme, asserting that Obama doesn’t have the business savvy and private-sector experience to lead the country out of the economic doldrums.

At the Bloomberg/Washington Post debate held at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., on Oct. 11, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was asked how he would get the country moving again.

Romney replied, ""I’d be prepared to be a leader. You can’t get the country to go in the right direction and get Washington to work if you don’t have a president that’s a leader. And three years ago, we selected a person who had never had any leadership experience, never worked in the private sector, never had the opportunity to actually bring people together, and he hasn’t been able to do so.

""He said he'd bring us hope and change. Instead, he’s divided the nation and tried to blame other people,"" Romney said.

The Romney campaign did not respond to two e-mails seeking sources for his claim. But Obama’s work experience, or lack thereof, is well-plowed ground, and he clearly has worked outside of government.

As PolitiFact reported two years ago when Joe Scarborough falsely asserted that Obama had never ""received a paycheck from a profit-making business,"" the president does, in fact, have some experience outside of government, albeit not in the Fortune 500 world. In fact, the bulk of his income in recent years has come from royalties from sales of his books.

Some of the relevant jobs in Obama’s work history include:

—  A stint in 1983-84 as a research assistant at Business International Corp. in New York City, where he helped write a newsletter.

—  Working from 1985 to 1988 as a community organizer for the Developing Communities Project in Chicago;

— Working from 1993 to 2004 as an associate, and then a partner, at the Chicago law firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, where his work included employment-discrimination and voting-rights cases. The job also overlapped with his time in the Illinois Legislature.

Obama himself in the past acknowledged that much of his experience was as a legislator, but during a meeting with the editorial board of the Valley News in West Lebanon, N.H., in November 2007, also noted that he had quickly built a $100 million political organization that at the time was rivaling the long-in-the-making Clinton machine.

Asked at that 2007 meeting when he had first had to fire someone, Obama gave an answer that might hold water in any corporate boardroom.

Obama said when he was 25, and working as a community organizer, he hired a woman who was ""significantly older than me to help set up a college prep program for local young people"" but that it ""became clear after two to three months that she was poorly suited for the job.""

""It was brutal. She had left another job to take this one, and in some ways I realized it was my fault, not having recognized that she didn’t fit in this task,"" Obama said. ""What I took from it was that you clean up your messes quickly. When you make a mistake you correct it, even when it’s hard.""

The ruling:  Obama may not have the corporate chops of Romney, but he’s worked in several jobs in the private sector -- and had management experience. And if you count his best-selling books that have brought Obama millions of dollars in royalties, he also knows something about entrepreneurship. We rate Romney’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB841500>],/factchecks/2011/oct/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-barack-obama-has-no-private-sector-exp/

Sen. Mike Fasano says most of your Progress Energy Florida power bill is pass-throughs
","
Progress Energy Florida may ask that its customers foot the bill for the physical repairs to a nuclear plant that will be offline years longer than expected. 
That has state Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, upset. Fasano, who regularly argues on behalf of  ""the little guy or gal,"" recently told St. Petersburg Times that he was concerned the latest $2.5 billion repair price tag -- which includes paying for the fuel to replace the energy generated by the nuclear plant -- would overburden the company's Tampa Bay and Central Florida ratepayers. 
To hammer home the point, Fasano offered an interesting detail about the power bill Progress Energy customers pay each month. 
""Already, just a little over 60 percent of your electric bill, my electric bill, 60 percent of that is pass-throughs, whether they be for building of nuclear plants or whatever they may be,"" Fasano said. ""This (repair) will only increase that percentage."" 
This fact-check will address two points. First, does 60 percent of a Progress Energy customer's bill pay for something called ""pass-throughs"" (and just what is that)? And second, will the repair of the damaged nuclear plant make things worse? 
They pay, so you pay 
The term ""pass-through"" is what it sounds like: Certain costs that get passed through to utility customers. The utility pays, so you pay.

But that's an oversimplification. So let us explain.

Progress Energy Florida is an investor-owned company regulated by the state's Public Service Commission. The commission makes the rules and sets the rates.

There are two pieces to your electric bill, the ""base rate"" and ""cost recovery clauses."" The base rate doesn't often change. It only gets adjusted when a utility applies to the commission for a new base rate. That can be a lengthy and burdensome process, so a base rate might stay in place for years. The base rate compensates a utility for producing and delivering electricity, plus investment in its plants and facilities, plus an ""allowed return"" -- you might call it profit.

Again, that's the base rate. Then there are the ""cost recovery clauses."" Some costs -- say, for example, fuel -- rise and fall dramatically. So the commission lets a utility file a different type of request each year to pass those costs directly to you, rather than include them in its base rate. If fuel ends up costing less in a given year, ratepayers get some money back. If it costs more, well, ratepayers shell out extra. That's the essence of a pass-through.

We should note that while pass-throughs get speedier review than a proposed change to the base rate, they're not automatic. They still have to be approved by the Public Service Commission.

In Florida, fuel costs are handled as a pass-through, as are expenses related to energy efficiency programs and environmental compliance. Then there's a relatively recent, and controversial, pass-through -- for new nuclear power. That's the one that allows Progress Energy to charge you for planning and construction costs years before a project actually produces any energy. Right now, a little less than 5 percent of a typical Progress Energy residential bill helps pay for a Levy County plant that may be more than a decade away, plus a project to boost capacity at the Crystal River plant that's offline for unrelated repairs. (The Crystal River nuclear plant is the one that prompted Fasano's comments germane to this fact-check.) 
In coming years, that chunk could soar dramatically. 
Percentages

To test Fasano's claim that ""just a little over 60 percent of your electric bill ... is pass-throughs,"" we asked Progress Energy Florida for a breakdown. Spokeswoman Suzanne Grant provided these numbers, which show that fuel costs make up the biggest chunk of a typical 1,000 kilowatt-hour residential bill, followed by the base rate that pays for essentials from power lines to energy workers: 
  
  
We did some math, which showed that Fasano's close when he says ""just a little over 60 percent."" Right now, pass-throughs make up just under 60 percent, though it may be headed up:
  
  
Crystal River's impact on your bill 
Now, back to that Crystal River plant, which suffered cracks in its containment wall in 2009 during an attempt to replace steam generators. It's been out for the count ever since. 
Some of the costs associated with the plant shutdown are pass-throughs -- more costly fuel. Progress has had to turn to more expensive sources to replace the nuclear power, such as natural gas, boosting the typical residential bill by $3.82, according to the company. 
Next year, the Crystal River outage could add $4.70 a month -- again, because replacement fuel costs more than nuclear power -- meaning your bill could be nearly 4 percent higher than it would have been. 

The hit would be worse, but Progress Energy's insurance coverage has picked up quite a bit. Still, the future's not exciting: The company's coverage for replacement power expires in August 2012, according the public counsel's office, more than a year before the nuclear plant's fixed. 
St. Petersburg Times reporter Ivan Penn wrote that ""the utility has projected there will be an additional $1 billion in replacement power and fuel costs until the plant comes back online, with customers paying about $560 million of that cost."" 
Meanwhile, some of the price tag -- for the physical repairs to the plant itself -- isn't a pass-through, according to the Public Service Commission. So you won't see it for a while. If Progress wants its customers to pay for what's not covered by insurance, that would have to be part of a change to the base rate. And Progress' current agreement with the commission means no base rate update through the end of 2012.

Our ruling

Fasano said, ""Already, just a little over 60 percent of your electric bill, my electric bill, 60 percent of that is pass-throughs, whether they be for building of nuclear plants or whatever they may be. This (repair) will only increase that percentage."" 
Pass-throughs actually represent just under 60 percent of a Progress Energy bill, so he's close. 
But there's two caveats to Fasano's claim. The first is just what constitutes a pass-through. A casual reader of Fasano's statement might imagine that the bulk of a customer's bill goes to big projects unrelated to the power they consume, rather than to something as central as fuel -- and fuel represents by far the largest pass-through cost. 
Second, the problems with the Crystal River plant create some pass-through costs -- through paying for more expensive fuel -- and possibly some non-pass-through costs, namely the physical repairs. 
On balance, we rate Fasano's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB0E7A00>],/factchecks/2011/oct/18/mike-fasano/sen-mike-fasano-says-most-progress-energy-floridas/

Pitts on health care: long, with no amendments
","
Continuing their battle against the health care overhaul, a group of Republican congressmen held a press conference on Oct. 5, 2011, outside the Capitol, waving a petition they say was signed by 1.6 million Americans calling for a repeal of the law.

The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank, in an Oct. 6 column, criticized the Republicans for dithering about the past rather than enacting job-creating legislation that could better position their party to take back the White House next November.

Milbank plucked verbal nuggets from several GOP lawmakers, concluding with a truncated quote from Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania.

""Monstrous!"" contributed Rep. Joe Pitts (Pa.). ""This was a 2,733-page bill! . . . No amendments! . . . Partisan vote!""

The entire quote, which we found in a transcript of the press conference, goes like this: ""This was a 2,733-page bill that went directly from Harry Reid's desk to the Senate floor, bypassed Senate committee, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, directly from the Senate floor to the House floor, bypass the committees, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, without one member having read this bill.""

A lot of claims are packed into that one sentence, but we thought we’d dig into just a couple of them. One, is the bill really that long? And two, were there no amendments at all during its long road to passage?

The page count

We asked Pitts’ office where the 2,733 came from, and his spokesman said Pitts was referring to ""how long the bill was the week it was considered in the House.""

According to the Library of Congress, which catalogs all versions of the different bills, the one that passed the Senate in December 2009 numbers 2,409 pages. The following March, the House passed the same bill and both chambers  passed a reconciliation bill that modified the law (and appeased Democrats in the House). It numbers 55 pages.

Added up, the total is 2,464.

Pitts’ spokesman acknowledged that the law is shorter now, but said ""if you go back to March 2010, you can find a number of contemporary references to the bill as numbering 2,700 pages.""

We looked at other versions of the bill but could not find any that had that number. Still, while Pitts is off slightly because of different versions and how the document is broken into pages, his underlying point is right: It was a very long bill.

No amendments?

Whether the bill had no amendments is a much trickier claim.

If you remember your Civics 101 class (and Schoolhouse Rock), you might recall how a bill becomes law: Usually, the House and Senate pass different versions of a bill, then they work out their differences in a conference committee. A unified bill comes out of that committee, and both bodies vote again on the new bill. Then the president signs it.

For the health care bill, back in 2009, the House and Senate had each passed different versions. It was widely expected the two bills would be stitched together in conference committee, then voted on again. But before that could happen, the Democrats lost their 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. (Republican Scott Brown in January 2010 won the seat formerly held by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.) Anything that came out of conference committee at that point could have been held up in the Senate, blocked by 40 Republican senators.

Democrats decided to get around this by having the House simply accept the Senate’s version of the bill. Obama signed that version into law. Then the Democrats used a different measure -- a reconciliation bill, which requires only a simple majority -- to modify the law they had passed.

The House version of the bill -- the one that never made it to conference committee -- did have amendments, particularly as it was considered by committees. In fact, Pitts himself offered one of them, a provision restricting abortion coverage. (It was better known as the Stupak amendment because it was co-sponsored by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich.) Several Senate versions of the bill also had amendments.

But Pitts is right that the Senate version -- the one voted on in December that became the basis of the new law -- did not have amendments.

This is because Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, decided to create a new version of the bill in the form of a manager’s amendment. At that point in the process, negotiations with Senate Republicans had gone on for months, and it seemed very likely that none of the Republicans were going to support the Senate bill, with amendments or not.

We should note that President Barack Obama claimed back in September 2009 that legislation in the works was bipartisan. At the time, we rated his characterization Barely True. (It would now be called Mostly False.) The two parties were never very close together on what a new health care law should include.

 Our ruling

Pitts said, ""This was a 2,733-page bill that went directly from Harry Reid's desk to the Senate floor, bypassed Senate committee, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, directly from the Senate floor to the House floor, bypass the committees, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, without one member having read this bill.""

As far as the number of pages go, Pitts is largely correct. If we’re going to put an official page count on the bill, we would put it at 2,464, but we recognize that the bill had several different versions as it was on its way to becoming a law.

As for ""no amendments,"" Pitts is right as it related to the floor passage of the Senate bill. There were no amendments to the bill that passed.

But that’s like describing only the last two minutes of a football game. What about the other 58?

The health care bill began in committee in both chambers of Congress, as virtually all bills do. There was ample opportunity to amend it, and the bill was in fact amended by both Democrats and Republicans, if only mostly on technicalities by the party opposed to it.  

But Pitts made a blanket statement that there were ""no amendments,"" without taking the earlier part of the process into account. Given all that, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB821100>],/factchecks/2011/oct/18/joe-pitts/pitts-healthcare-long-no-amendments/

Cain says solar, wind energy have little potential
","
If you want a glimpse of America’s energy future under a Herman Cain administration, look no further than his new book, ""This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House.""

Metro Atlanta’s would-be Republican presidential nominee wrote that we need to drill for oil offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and boost our nuclear energy capabilities.

""Let’s face it, wind and solar energy development will not bring us to energy independence,"" the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO wrote. ""Even the Department of Energy’s ‘Billion Ton Study’ has shown that these two sources combined could at best provide only 5 percent of our total energy needs.""

Do solar and wind energy really have so little potential?

We contacted the Cain campaign, which did not respond, so we scoured the U.S. Department of Energy’s ""Billion Ton Study,"" a 2005 report whose official title is ""Biomass as Feedstock for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts Industry.""

As you might suspect, it’s about biomass, biological material such as plants or cow manure that can be used to produce energy. Like solar and wind energy, it’s ""renewable,"" or comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished.  

It does not say what Cain said it did.

In fact, the ""Billion Ton Study"" mentions only solar and wind energy in passing. The crux of the report is to explore whether there’s enough biomass in the U.S. to replace 30 percent or more of the nation’s petroleum use. (Their answer is ""yes,"" assuming that certain policies and technologies are in place.)

Now, just because Cain’s claim isn’t backed up by the ""Billion Ton Study"" doesn’t mean his broader point about solar and wind is wrong. We dug further.

We found that under current government energy policies, the futures of solar and wind are limited, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks energy statistics. Unless policies change, by 2035 wind and solar combined will account for 4 percent of U.S. consumption of electricity, or the stuff that runs our TVs or washing machines, their projections show.

Solar and wind will account for 2 percent of total U.S. energy consumption in 2035. This includes electricity as well as other forms of energy, such as fuel that powers cars.

But these data do not describe what these technologies could do at their best, which was the main point of Cain’s statement. To get a better sense of this, we interviewed energy experts and read federal studies and peer-reviewed research.

The scientific consensus is that there is more than enough sunshine and wind to supply the nation’s total energy needs, experts told us, thanks to the wind-swept Great Plains and Texas and sun-baked states such as New Mexico.

""I don’t think anybody can contend there isn’t enough. There’s more than enough,"" said Noam Lior, who has studied solar and other alternative energy technologies and their potential at the University of Pennsylvania.  

But could it actually happen? Could solar and wind actually provide, say, 10 percent of the nation’s total needs?

""It’s not just possible,"" said Daniel Matisoff, who studies environmental policy at Georgia Tech. ""It’s likely.""    

For instance, a 2008 Energy Department report said it’s possible for wind energy to provide 20 percent of the nation’s electricity supply by 2030, with significant upgrades in the nation’s energy grid, policy changes that support the growth of the wind industry, and some wind turbine technology improvements.  

Electricity, however, makes up only a portion of the nation’s total energy use. The country needs fuel to power its cars and trucks as well. Getting consumers to switch to plug-in electric cars might be tough because of their limited range, said Marilyn A. Brown, a Georgia Tech professor who studies energy policy.

There are other big hurdles as well. The wind doesn’t always blow, and sun doesn’t always shine, so the U.S. would need to engineer systems that would keep a steady flow of electricity to homes and businesses.

Electricity produced by fossil fuels is often less expensive than wind or solar. And lots of the nation’s wind and solar resources are in remote areas. The country needs to install expensive transmission lines to transport it.

All in all, Cain has it wrong on solar and wind energy. The federal government’s ""Billion Ton Study"" did not say that wind and solar energy combined ""could at best provide only 5 percent of our total energy needs.""

Scientists think solar and wind alone can top 5 percent of the nation’s total needs with policy and infrastructure changes. They could even power the entire nation if the U.S. commits to an energy overhaul, though it would take a lot of resources, time, political will, and possibly some new technologies to get this done.

Cain earns a False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC835140>],/factchecks/2011/oct/18/herman-cain/cain-says-solar-wind-energy-have-little-potential/

Occupy Wall Street protester's sign says 94 percent of deeper-pocketed candidates win
","
A reader recently sent us a link to a photograph taken at the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City’s Zuccotti Park on Oct. 5, 2011. It showed a protester holding a sign that said, ""94% of winning candidates in 2010 had more money than their opponents. Is this Democracy?""

This statistic has been cited in a number of other forums recently. For instance, MSNBC host Dylan Ratigan -- who is backing a petition for a constitutional amendment to ""Get Money Out"" of politics -- used it on Martin Bashir’s MSNBC show on Sept. 27, 2011.]

Ratigan said ""there is a single statistic that I think is the only statistic that you need to understand about money and politics in America. … If you look at campaign for federal office, Congress, president, whatever, … if I know who raised more money, without even knowing anything else, 94 percent of the time I will pick the winner.""

We took up the reader’s suggestion to fact-check the statistic.

We’ll first note that the creator of the sign is not specific about what offices are being referred to. We found two data sets that directly address the issue, both compiled by nonpartisan groups that track money in politics. One is the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks spending patterns in races for U.S. House and Senate seats. The other is the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks spending in state legislative contests.

In congressional races in 2010, the candidate who spent the most won 85 percent of the House races and 83 percent of the Senate races, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That’s a large percentage, but it’s lower than what the sign indicated.

Indeed, the percentage for 2010 was lower than it had been in recent election cycles. The center found that in 2008, the biggest spenders won 93 percent of House races and 86 percent of Senate races. In 2006, the top spenders won 94 percent of House races and 73 percent of Senate races. And in 2004, 98 percent of House seats went to candidates who spent the most, as did 88 percent of Senate seats.

So the protester’s sign would have been essentially correct had it not specifically cited 2010 -- though even then, it would only be true for the House and not for the Senate, which has consistently seen lower percentages of the bigger spenders win.

Meanwhile, the success rate of big spenders has been lower at the state level.

The most recent figures, from the 2008 election cycle, show that 80 percent of state legislative candidates with the monetary advantage won their contests. In 2006, it was 83 percent; in 2004, it was 84 percent; and in 2002, it was 82 percent. (The group’s figures for 2010 are due to be released in the next month or so.)

So the percentages for state legislative races have also been consistently lower than what the sign indicated.

Our ruling

The protester has a point: Even in the relatively atypical year of 2010, a large majority of contests for congressional and state legislative races were won by candidates who spent the most money, and the 94 percent mark was reached in federal races in 2006 and nearly again in 2008.

Still, the sign’s figures were off. In 2010 -- which is not only the most recent election year but also the year specifically cited in the sign -- the percentage of big-money winners in U.S. House races was actually 85 percent, or nine points lower. And the percentages of U.S. Senate seats and state legislative seats won by the deeper-pocketed candidate have been consistently lower in recent election cycles. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBED1D80>],/factchecks/2011/oct/17/occupy-wall-street/occupy-wall-street-protesters-sign-says-94-percent/

Obama adviser Axelrod says Republican want deep education cuts
","
Speaking in New Hampshire last month, presidential adviser David Axelrod didn't focus his attacks on Mitt Romney or Rick Perry. Instead, he took aim at a man who's not in the presidential race: Rep.Paul Ryan.

Axelrod, who is leading President Barack Obama's bid for re-election, had harsh words for Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee, over the committee's controversial budget proposal, which Axelrod said threatened America's future with severe spending cuts.

""If you cut education by 25 percent, which is what's been proposed on the other side, you're mortgaging our future,"" Axelrod told an audience during a September 27, 2011 speech at the Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H.

""Our students are sliding compared to other countries,"" Axelrod said, criticizing the Ryan plan’s proposed cuts.

Ryan and House Republicans took a lot of pride in proposing billions of dollars in spending cuts in House Resolution 34, Ryan's budget blueprint. But, did they really propose cutting education funding by a quarter? PolitiFact is on the case.

We started by approaching the Obama campaign, which pointed us to the Ryan budget plan, as well as other statements the president and other White House officials have issued about education cuts.

As a resolution, the Ryan proposal doesn't provide specific breakdowns of its spending plans, but instead groups education funding with training, employment and social services in a category called Function 500.

Ryan spokesman Gerrit Lansing said that looking at such a large category is no way to accurately judge specific spending measures, and he pointed out that the budget resolution does not set final spending levels, but instead provides a maximum amount that can be spent. Congressional committees would determine the final funding levels from there.

""This is not an apples to apples comparison,"" Lansing wrote in an email. ""Function 500 contains job training programs, student loans, the Smithsonian (Institution), billions in Social Services Block Grants, and more – none of which have much to do with K-12 programs that a reader assumes refers to ‘education spending."".

But other budget analysts disagree. Education funding makes up the largest segment of Function 500, often encompassing 90 percent or more of the costs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So, for this piece, we’ll continue to use it to set the basis for comparison.

As proposed in April, Ryan's plan, which passed the House of Representatives but failed to pass the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate, would have directed $77.2 billion during the current fiscal year to education and the other Function 500 categories. That number is down $15 billion, or 16.3 percent from last year's spending level, which has extended into the current fiscal year thanks to a continuing resolution from Congress. It is also $28 billion or 27 percent lower than the president's fiscal year 2012 budget proposal.

Because they haven’t yet passed a budget for 2012, federal lawmakers are operating on a continuing resolution, which continues spending at last year’s levels. With the resolution set to expire November 18, however, members of the House Appropriations Committee have drafted a new spending plan that would leave education funding at $69 billion, 3 percent lower than the current level and 14 percent lower than the President’s budget request. This plan, worked out by an Appropriations subcommittee and introduced September 29, has not yet been taken up by the full committee or on the House floor.

In Washington, budget managers and analysts don't typically consider the president's budget plan, or bills still pending in committee, when drawing spending comparisons. Instead, they look to the Congressional Budget Office's baseline projections, which estimate the cost of maintaining current services, factoring in inflation.

The CBO projections, issued in March, call for $95 billion in the 2012 fiscal year to maintain current education and social services, according to agency reports. The $77.2 billion included in Ryan's budget proposal is 16.8 percent lower than the CBO figure. That number increases to 20.6 percent in 2013 and 22 percent in 2014, and it reaches the 25 percent mark in 2016 when the Ryan plan proposes $76.2 billion in Function 500 funding – $25.5 billion less than the CBO's baseline projection of what it would take to maintain services as they exist today in that year.

The Ryan budget's proposed cuts remain above 25 percent each year between 2016 and 2021. In total, the plan proposes $782.7 billion in Function 500 spending between 2012 and 2021 – $250 billion, or 24.2 percent less than the $1 trillion required to maintain current services, according to the CBO baseline.

""The Republican budget resolution further cuts education every year, quickly reaching annual cuts of more than 25 percent below current levels that will harm education for our children now and the quality of our future workforce, as well,"" Democratic members of the House Budget Committee wrote in opposition to the budget proposal after it was released in April.

Our ruling:

Because Budget Resolution 34 doesn't include detailed breakdowns of Function 500 spending reductions, it's impossible to determine exactly how much of the cuts are proposed to come out of the education budget. Further, the plan itself, in resolution form, does not dictate exact spending levels, but instead sets the maximum amount that can be spent. Congressional committees and floor votes determine the rest.

Still, because education spending makes up such a large proportion of the total Function 500 costs – over 90 percent – it's safe to assume most of the cuts from this category would come from education.

With that in mind, the percentages don't lie. The Ryan budget proposal included more than 25 percent funding cuts every year between 2016 and 2021, and it proposed a total 24 percent funding cut between 2012 and 2021, within range of Axelrod’s 25 percent figure. Axelrod's figures are correct  if you include everything in the category, most of which is education, but it also includes items that are not education.

We rate Axelrod's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA8C480>],/factchecks/2011/oct/17/david-axelrod/obama-adviser-axelrod-says-republican-want-deep-ed/

Genting has proposed a 10-million-square-foot development including a casino, and the Herald has reported on the various elements of the largesse -- a 3.6-acre outdoor lagoon as large as 12 Olympic-size swimming pools, 5,200 hotel rooms, 1,000 condo units, more than 50 restaurants, lounges, bars and nightclubs, ranging from fine dining to buffets and a food court for a total of 700,000 square feet, about 60 luxury shops, plus a marketplace for a total of 250,000 square feet, and 750,000 square feet of convention and meeting space including a 200,000-square-foot ballroom. 
Big right? But what about the size of the casino space? 

A group opposing the expansion of gambling in South Florida, No Casinos, made a claim in an Oct. 11, 2011, ""Myth vs. Facts"" chart that a bill in the works by two South Florida legislators would pave the way for a record-breaking enormous casino.

On the ""myth"" side of the group's ledge, they say: ""The bill carefully limits the scale of casino gambling by requiring that the casino occupy no more than 10 percent of the entire development …""

And now for the ""fact"":

""The 'sleight of hand' is one of the casino promoter's best tricks. The fact is the bill would put the biggest casinos in the world right here in Florida. In fact, the casino proposed by Malaysian gambling conglomerate Genting would be nearly double the size of the largest casino in the world. In fact, even if Genting limits the casino size to 8 percent of their development, that Miami casino would be big enough to house six modern marquee casinos on the Las Vegas Strip –- with room to spare! The Genting casino alone would comfortably fit the casinos of the MGM Grand, the Wynn, the Mirage, the Bellagio, Caesar’s Palace and the Venetian. If 3 casinos of this size are built, Florida would have as much casino gambling as 20 or more casinos on the Las Vegas strip –- and all the money would be in the hands of just 3 companies.""

There are a lot of interesting numbers in that paragraph, but we wanted to find out if the proposed bill would mean that Genting's proposal would ""nearly double the size of the largest casino in the world.""

First, a little background. Genting announced in May that it had purchased land owned by the Miami Herald (which partners on PolitiFact Florida with the St. Petersburg Times) for $236 million and later took over the $206 million mortgage on the neighboring Omni Center. Genting has now amassed about 30 acres. Part of the resort could open as early as 2012 months after it hopes to get approval from the state Legislature for a gambling license. The Genting Group has holdings in resorts and casinos among other industries and owns 50 percent of Miami-based Norwegian Cruise Line.

On Oct. 6, 2011, an appeals court gave the go-ahead for legislators to expand gambling in South Florida. Specifically, the First District Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision that concluded that a law passed by the Legislature allowing Hialeah Racetrack to offer slot machines was constitutional and rejected the argument by other facilites that when voters approved slot machines in Miami-Dade and Broward that limited the number of permits to seven pari-mutuels.

Two South Florida legislators -- State Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff (R-Fort Lauderdale) and Rep. Erik Fresen (R-Miami) -- are drafting a bill that would pave the way for three resort casinos in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The bill would create a Florida Gaming Commission and companies could submit bids for casino licenses. The Legislature is expected to take it the legislation when it convenes in January.

Bogdanoff and Fresen said the bill they will produce will restrict each resort to using no more than 10 percent of their total footprint for casino games.

If state legislators approve the 10 percent limit and Genting builds a 10-million -square-foot resort -- as the company said it plans -- that would mean the casino area could be a maximum of 1 million square feet. (A note: Genting would still have to bid for the rights to build the casino.) 
China has the largest casino

We asked John Sowinski, spokesman for No Casinos, to explain how the group determined that Genting's casino would be nearly double the largest casino in the world. (Kind of obvious, but No Casinos is a group that opposes the expansion of gambling. Sowinski said the group has fought gambling issues since the 1970s.)

Sowinski pointed us to a 2009 article in BusinessWeek about the 20 biggest casinos in the world. The article listed the Venetian Macao in China as the biggest --- saying the casino measured 546,000 square feet and had 3,000 gaming or slot machines and 870 casino tables for various games. (This Las Vegas Sands website states that the Venetian Macao is 550,000 square feet.)

Three gaming experts confirmed for us that Venetian Macao is the largest: David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada and Holly Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the American Gaming Association, and Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business Magazine, a publication of the American Gaming Association and a trade publication for the gaming industry.

So the largest casino in the world measures about 546,000 square feet and theoretically, the Genting Group could build a casino that's 1 million square feet. No Casinos took that into account to get to its claim that the Miami casino ""would be nearly double the size of the largest casino in the world."" The group also cited a lower figure -- Sowinski referred us to this article from the Beacon Council, Miami-Dade County's economic development partnership, that stated that Genting's casino size would be 800,000 square feet. 

A Genting spokeswoman in Miami, Kelly Penton, told us that the gaming floor at Resorts World Miami will measure no more than 8 percent of the total footprint putting the casino size at 800,000 square feet. At that size, four Super Targets would fit in the casino -- with room to spare. She said it's too early to tell on the number of machines. 
Sowinski says if Genting doesn't build up to full capacity initially for the casino they could over the time.

""Why would they limit themselves if the Legislature gives them more than they ask for?"" 

Our ruling

The problem is we won't know for at least months, if not years, the size of Genting's casino in Miami.

Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told us there's no way Genting's Miami project will be double size of the Venetian Macao. ""The market isn’t that big and there will be several large competitors in Florida ... Genting will never build a 1 million square foot casino,"" he wrote. 

Schwartz also expressed some skepticism about whether Genting would build a 1-million-square-foot casino.

""Hard to say -- all of Atlantic City has about 1.3 million square feet of casino space, and that's 11 casinos. If they populated their casino at the same density as Harrah's Atlantic City (the biggest in the market by floor space) they'd have 12,967 slot machines and 737 table games, which is huge -- far bigger, by positions, than the Venetian Macao,"" Schwartz wrote in an e-mail. ""If they had a complete monopoly on the South Florida market, they might be able to support that kind of footprint, but I'm skeptical that,with any competition in the region, a casino that size could work. It's certainly far larger than anything that's ever been attempted, and we might start to see diseconomies of scale. Without seeing their blueprints it's hard to say for sure."" 
We see their point, but for now all we have to go on is Genting's own words. They said they want to build a casino that is 800,000 square feet. That is significantly larger than the largest casino in the world, though we believe it falls a little shy of  ""nearly double.""

Milwaukee County executve says sheriff's office plays ""limited role"" in law enforcement, reports few major crimes
","
With his 2012 budget, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele proposed to cut more than $14 million and 240 positions from the sheriff’s office -- cuts larger than for any other county department.

His rationale?

When it comes to crime fighting, Abele essentially said, the sheriff’s office doesn’t do much.

""By statute and by practice, the sheriff plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency,"" Abele said in his budget remarks to the County Board on Sept. 29, 2011.

""For example, in 2009 the sheriff reported only 12 crimes to the FBI, compared to 41,000 for the City of Milwaukee and 3,200 for West Allis, and even 242 for the UWM Police Department.""

Wait.

The sheriff’s department, covering the entire county, reported far fewer crimes to the FBI than the campus police at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee?

Let’s address the two parts of Abele’s statement one at a time.

Sheriff plays ""limited role"" in law enforcement:

Abele’s claim bolsters what is his opinion, but it is important in the context of his entire statement. The first-term county executive is arguing that his budget cuts are justified because the sheriff’s office plays only a limited role in what he calls traditional law enforcement.

It’s certainly true that the Milwaukee County sheriff’s office has less responsibility for crime fighting than sheriff’s departments in less urban parts of Wisconsin, given that Milwaukee County is filled with cities and villages that have their own police departments.

That means under FBI rules the vast majority of crimes in Milwaukee County are reported by local agencies and not the sheriff’s office, said Tami Jackson, spokesman for the state Office of Justice Assistance, which coordinates FBI reporting.

The sheriff’s office also differs from local police departments in that it runs two jails, provides bailiffs for the courthouse and provides other inmate-related services.

Indeed, under Abele’s budget, nearly three-fourths of the 1,146 sheriff’s employees would work in what is known as the detention division, while less than 20 percent would perform what are called police services: crime investigation, patrol and providing security for the airport, parks and County Grounds.  

So, it is clear the sheriff’s office has less responsibility for crime fighting than other police agencies. But by running jails and patrolling freeways, among other duties, it is providing other essential law enforcement services.  

Sheriff reported few crimes to FBI:

In his claim about crimes reported to the FBI, Abele was citing the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting figures for 2009, said his spokesman, Jeff Bentoff.

Those major crime statistics are released annually by the FBI and are tracked regularly by news media such as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which maintains a searchable database of UCR data.

Through UCR, local law enforcement agencies report to the FBI four types of violent crime (murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) and four types of property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson).

So, the statistic Abele is citing covers only a limited portion of offenses that local law enforcement authorities handle and only the most serious ones.

We found Abele accurately quoted the total number of UCR crimes reported to the FBI in 2009 by Milwaukee police (more than 41,000); West Allis police (more than 3,200); and UWM police (242-- five violent and 237 property crimes).

Abele was off a bit when he said the sheriff’s office reported 12 crimes to the FBI in 2009. The sheriff’s office actually reported seven violent crimes plus 12 property crimes for a total of 19 UCR crimes.

Although Abele gave the wrong figure in his budget speech, he quoted the correct figure in other budget documents.  

(Bentoff said Abele cited 2009 UCR statistics because they were the most recent available when Abele’s budget was assembled. We found 2010 figures and they show a similar disproportion -- the sheriff’s department reported 38 UCR crimes to the FBI in 2010, far fewer than the 271 reported by UWM police.)

So, Abele was correct in claiming that the sheriff’s office reported far fewer crimes to the FBI in 2009 than UWM police did.

But is that the whole picture in terms of crime fighting? Was the sheriff’s office involved in handling only 19 serious crimes in all of 2009?

When we asked Clarke spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin about Abele’s statement, she did not rebut his statistic. Rather, she argued that Abele ""cherry picked"" a figure that she said doesn’t reflect the many non-UCR offenses handled by the sheriff’s office.

McLaughlin provided summaries that show the sheriff’s office made 1,927 arrests in 2009. Relatively few were for serious crimes. A sampling: One arrest was for murder, one was for second-degree sexual assault and 15 were for battery.

In contrast, more than 1,000 of the sheriff’s arrests were for operating while intoxicated. In Wisconsin, OWI doesn’t become a crime until the second offense.

The sheriff’s office also recorded 290 arrests for disorderly conduct, which can be a municipal offense or a misdemeanor crime.

So, while the sheriff’s office does handle some serious crimes, most of its traditional police work involves lesser offenses.

Our conclusion

Abele said the sheriff’s office ""plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency"" and in 2009 reported far fewer crimes to the FBI than UWM police did.

Abele’s claim about the FBI reporting was accurate and it reflects the fact that the sheriff’s office handles relatively few major crimes. On the other hand, the sheriff’s office runs jails, patrols freeways and provides other services that other police agencies rely on and that are essential components of traditional law enforcement.

We rate Abele’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB0F1900>],/factchecks/2011/oct/17/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executve-says-sheriffs-office-pla/

Building a Better Ohio touts Issue 2 for potential savings of tax dollars
","
A key thrust of Issue 2 proponents is that public employees need to pay their fair share of the cost of health and pension benefits.

The issue, a referendum on Senate Bill 5 and its overhaul of Ohio’s collective bargaining laws for public workers, would require public employees to contribute at least 15 percent of the cost of their health benefits and 10 percent of their salaries toward pensions.

Gov. John Kasich has repeatedly said it’s only fair to demand such participation in light of what private sector employees pay for their health care and retirement benefits.

A campaign ad from Building a Better Ohio, an organization pushing for passage of Issue 2, focuses specifically on those two figures, and touts the savings they could yield.

""Issue 2’s reasonable reforms will save taxpayer dollars,"" the ad claims.

We’ll leave it to others to debate the phrase ""reasonable,"" but PolitiFact Ohio decided to explore the purported savings. We’re focusing here on health care and pension costs because that’s what the ad discussed.

It’s clear governments will save money if their employees contribute more toward the costs of their benefits, but those savings are not across the board, applying to each level of government.

Savings in those two areas will not come at the state government level because its employees already pay 15 percent of their health care costs and put 10 percent of their wages toward their pensions.

But what about the counties, cities, townships, school districts and the like across the state that employ more than 300,000 workers?

For health care benefits, the savings would vary greatly from community to community, .

Cities like Akron, for instance — where union and nonunion workers alike do not pay for health insurance — could save millions in personnel costs. The city’s tab for health care in 2010 was $23.5 million. If the new law had been in effect, Akron workers would have paid more than $3.5 million of the cost. For the 1,941 workers with health care, that would amount to about $1,800 each.
   
Employees in Avon, on the other hand, already pay 20 percent of their health care costs. So they wouldn’t pay a dime extra for coverage under the law, and there would be no savings to the community.

In an analysis of the fiscal impact of SB 5, The Department of Administrative Services estimates that localities will save about $98 million a year in health care costs if their employees are made to pay at least 15 percent of their health care costs.

DAS calculated the estimate using State Employment Relations Board statistics from 2010 (2011 numbers were not available at the time) that show employees of cities, school boards, townships and counties now pay a combined average of 10.8 percent of their health care costs.

That comes to a total of $255.9 million.

If the average contribution is raised to 15 percent, the total increases to $353.9 million. That translates into a combined savings of $98 million with school districts saving the most at $61.4 million, cities at $30.6 million, townships at $4.1 million and counties at $1.8 million.

Still, these numbers are estimates, based on a self-reporting survey in which only 79 percent of the 1,359 governmental jurisdictions in the state participated.

Melissa Fazekas, spokeswoman for Issue 2 opponent We Are Ohio, said the numbers can’t be trusted because they are based on an incomplete survey. The state contends the sample size far exceeds the required number and has a margin of error of three percent.

Coming up with an estimated savings on the pension side is more difficult, and the state makes no attempt to do so. But we’ll offer up a few figures to ponder.

As it stands, state law requires all employees to contribute 10 percent of their wages toward their pension. In some cases the employer pays some or all of that amount, a benefit that’s known as a ""pension pickup.""

There are 3,285 union contracts at the local level, according to the State Employment Relations Board. Of those contracts, 2,504 do not include pension pickups, so on those there would be no savings.  Another 245 do have pickups. The remaining 781 have not been reviewed sufficiently to say one way or the other.

It’s also worth looking possible savings in the five state pensions plans that represent public employees in Ohio.

We can check the Ohio Highway Patrol Retirement System off the list because its members are all state employees who already meet the requirements of SB 5.

The Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, the largest pension plan in the state and the eleventh largest in the country, represents 3,700 employers, but only about 9 percent of those employers offer their employees some level of pension pickup, said spokeswoman Julie Graham-Price.

The State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio estimates that 92 percent of its nearly 176,000 members already pay their full 10 percent, and of the 8 percent who don’t, most get only a partial pickup, said spokesman Nick Treneff.

The School Employees Retirement System of Ohio estimates that 95 to 97 percent of its 126,000 members pay their 10 percent share, said spokesman Tim Barbour.

The only pension plan that can attach a dollar figure to its volume of pension pickups is the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund. Fund members paid more than $197 million in pension contributions last year with nearly $60 million of that amount picked up by their employers, said spokesman Dave Graham.

So, clearly, the evidence suggests that taxpayer dollars -- perhaps millions -- will be saved if the health care and pension mandates in SB 5 become law. On that count, the statement in the Building a Better Ohio ad is accurate.

But there are some points to keep in mind.

At the state level, employees already are contributing at the 10 and 15 percent thresholds, something the ad does not mention.

Without examining each and every contract, it’s impossible to know exactly where the savings will occur and how large the savings will be at the local level. For communities in which the employees already meet those thresholds, there won’t be a savings. For others, the savings would vary depending on how much of the cost the communities pickup now with taxpayer dollars.

In the case of pension pickups, we can deduce that many localities will see little to no savings because employees already meet the mandates.

And there’s one other thing to consider. If union employees lose pension and health care benefits, they may be able to negotiate to get some of it back in the form of higher wages. And that could cancel out some of the savings to the taxpayer.

Those points provide additional information and clarification.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Burnt Orange Report']","
Democratic blogger says Donna Campbell doesn't live in senatorial district she's hoping to represent
","
Democratic blogger Katherine Haenschen, writing on the Austin-based Burnt Orange Report, welcomed word that Republican state Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio is likely drawing a challenger in his party’s March primary.

In an Oct. 3, 2011, entry, Haenschen noted that the prospective candidate, Donna Campbell, who is a physician, failed to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin in 2010. ""This should be interesting,"" Haenschen wrote. ""Dr. Donna is viewed by many as being actually insane.""

We can’t check looniness, but Haenschen’s blog included a seemingly verifiable claim: ""Dr. Donna, by the way, does not currently live in the (senatorial) district ... but is apparently planning to move to Hays County.""

The Texas Constitution holds that a Senate candidate must have been a resident of the district he or she seeks to represent for at least a year before election. And Wentworth represents the 25th Senatorial District, which runs from a portion of Bexar County north through all of Comal, Guadalupe, Hays and Kendall counties and into a sliver of Travis County, though its boundaries are penciled in to change a bit in time for next year’s election. The 2011 Legislature, acting on results of the 2010 census, reduced the parts of Guadalupe, Hays and Travis counties in the district.

By email, Haenschen told us she based her residency claim on information provided by Hays County activists.

Separately, we looked up a 2010 Republican Party of Texas candidate list showing Campbell as based in Columbus, in Colorado County, which is east of the 25th Senatorial District.

After digging through several bits of conflicting information, though, we’ve concluded that Campbell has since moved to New Braunfels.

As we began to check into the residency question, representatives of the Colorado County tax assessor-collector’s office told us Campbell was registered to vote in the county under the name Donna Burrows Campbell. But on Oct. 11, about a week after the Burnt Orange Report’s blog post, Campbell registered to vote in Guadalupe County, we confirmed with the county clerk’s office there.

The New Braunfels address that Campbell listed on the voter registration form is within the 25th Senate District, the Guadalupe County elections administrator told us.

More conflicting information came when we checked on Campbell’s homestead, which is one’s principal residence for tax purposes.

When we visited the website for Colorado County’s Central Appraisal District, it showed a homestead tax exemption for Donna Burrows on property on Texas 71 in the county. In a telephone interview, though, Olga Poncik of the Colorado County appraisal district told us the property is not registered as a homestead, though it was for 2010.

In an Oct. 6, 2011, interview, Campbell campaign consultant Luke Macias told us Campbell lives in New Braunfels. Declining our request to interview Campbell, he said that if Campbell were pulled over for speeding, she’d pull out her driver’s license showing that address. Asked for a copy of the license, he sent us a copy of an undated letter from the Texas Department of Public Safety to Campbell at the New Braunfels address, headlined: ""Attached is your new driver license/identification card.""

Our ruling

We were frustrated in this check because the blogger did not prove her claim and Campbell didn’t discuss it with us. 
Our sense, based on available information, is that while Campbell formerly lived in Colorado County and was even still registered to vote there at the time of the Burnt Orange Report blog post, she settled in the 25th District, and obtained a driver’s license there, some time after voting in October 2010 and before the blogger aired her claim.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Christine Whitman']","
Christie Whitman says she left state with a more than $1 billion budget surplus
","
Once upon a time, New Jersey had a surplus in the billions of dollars, according to a former governor.

There were surpluses in the state budget and there were surpluses in pension funds.

""The proudest accomplishment (of my tenure) was leaving the state with a $1.2 billion surplus, which was the largest we’d ever had, and getting spending under control and a balanced budget,"" former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said in a Sept. 19 interview on NJTV.

Since she is a governor who has been accused of shortchanging pension contributions to fund tax cuts, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check her statement.

David Rosen, the Legislative Budget and Finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed that Whitman left the state with a $1.2 billion surplus. And at least since 1986 – the first year the state’s budgets are available online – that surplus was the state’s largest, PolitiFact New Jersey found. There have been larger surpluses since she left office.

As for balancing the budget? That’s not an accomplishment. State law requires it.

But we questioned the part of Whitman’s statement in which she said she controlled spending.

Let’s review some of the spending during her tenure. Whitman reduced payments to the state’s pension funds to balance a 30-percent income tax cut enacted after she became governor in 1994. Three years later, Whitman had the state borrow $2.75 billion to deposit in the pension funds to address that liability. The stock market at that time was doing well and the infusion helped create a surplus in the accounts -- for a while. Then the stock market took a downtown.

But the pension issue wasn’t the only significant debt during Whitman’s tenure. She also approved an $8.6 billion school construction bill that was largely funded during the Jim McGreevey administration. Taken together, that’s more than $11 billion in debt.

Experts, however, told us that governmental standard accounting practices do not include debt in an annual budget.

Debt is included in the state’s financial statements, said Richard F. Keevey, who was budget director for former Gov. Jim Florio. Keevey, who teaches public budgeting systems and federal finance at Rutgers Newark, also served as a deputy budget director and budget director for former Gov. Tom Kean.

What’s included in the budget is debt service, or the amount paid toward the total debt.

Rosen also noted that New Jersey and the country had a strong economy during the Whitman years, from 1994 to Jan. 31, 2001. Whitman left office in the middle of her second gubernatorial term to become administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, DC.

""We were certainly in a surplus position as was the federal government,"" Rosen said. ""Nationally the economy was doing very well and governments generally were doing quite well. Most states had large surpluses, the federal government was in surplus and New Jersey was as well.""

James DiEleuterio, who was state treasurer from 1994 to 1997, said in an email that Whitman controlled spending by reviewing each of the 32,000 line items in the state budget, cutting unnecessary expenses, streamlining operations and cutting the state’s payroll by 5,000.  He also cited the 30 percent tax cut and changes in tax policy that he said improved the state’s economic climate.

""Finally, I want to ensure it is clear that Governor Whitman's surplus was not funded by pension funds,"" DiEleuterio wrote. ""Her tax cuts, and subsequent surplus, were funded the only way they should be: with true spending cuts and a balanced budget.""

Our ruling

Whitman says her proudest accomplishment as governor was leaving the state with a more than $1 billion surplus, controlling spending and balancing the budget. Her surplus number is accurate, and two financial experts tell us that basic government accounting principles do not include debt in budgets. Whitman’s former treasurer also claims the governor made traditional spending cuts during her tenure. But how is skipping payments to pension funds controlling spending if those and other bills aren’t being paid in full, or are being deferred to later administrations? We rate Whitman’s claim Mostly True.

"['County Budget', 'Criminal Justice', 'Wisconsin', 'David A. Clarke Jr.']","
Clarke says he’s never asked for more than inflationary increases in his department’s budget
","
David A. Clarke Jr. wants you to know that Chris Abele is not the new sheriff in town.

Clarke, the Milwaukee County sheriff since 2002, was spitting bullets when Abele --  the successor to former Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker  -- proposed balancing the 2012 county budget in large part by cutting deeply into Clarke’s agency.

Abele is a ""novice"" with ""disdain for law and order"" and a desire to ""coddle criminals,"" Clarke said on the Sept. 30, 2011 ""Midday with Charlie Sykes"" show on WTMJ-AM (620). Abele, the sheriff went on, proposes ""gutting"" the Sheriff’s Department.

The sheriff said he was very careful with taxpayer dollars, dating back to the Walker era, then added something that caught our ear.

""I never asked for additional resources. I never asked for more,"" Clarke said. ""Every budget I’ve ever asked for is just a cost to continue. In other words, what we’re doing now, I’m satisfied with the money that you gave us last year. If you just give us that again, with the rate of inflation because salaries go up and all those kind of things, I said, ‘I’m fine.’

He continued: ""And even with that, the (County Board) would turn around and take some money away. But you know, I can live with that. I don’t run the budget and I realize the finances are not infinite. The county’s in bad shape, I understand that.""

We’re aware of Clarke’s past efforts to streamline the department and rein in overtime payments that before his arrival had routinely helped bust the budget.

But did Clarke really confine himself -- every year -- to asking for inflationary increases?

Let’s frame this dispute -- and then take a look at the numbers.

Abele praises the Sheriff’s Department’s role but says that ""by statute and by practice, the sheriff plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency."" That’s the reason for the cuts, Abele told the County Board on Sept. 29, 2011.

Clarke is outspoken in his criticism of liberal elected officials, and sees Abele as just that. Plus, Abele’s misinformed about public safety, Clarke says. In particular, Clarke took shots at Abele’s bold decision to try to direct Clarke to make specific cuts. That usurps the sheriff’s constitutional powers, Clarke argues.

Now the numbers.

Part of this is simple math. County records document what Clarke asked for each year compared with the adopted budget handed to him the year before. We looked at 10 budgets, from Clarke’s first in 2003 to the proposal he made for 2012.

We found that in five years, his requests topped the previous year -- while in five years he asked for less or about the same.

When he sought more, the increases ranged from 4 percent up to 13 percent. In every case through 2010, those increases were greater than inflation, based on the consumer price index for Milwaukee-Racine calculated by the U.S. Department of Labor. The government has not yet calculated 2011 rates.

Seems cut and dried.

But nothing involving Milwaukee County’s often-arcane and cumbersome budgeting process is simple, so we took a second look and talked to the sheriff and other county officials.

First, Clarke.

Through his budget officials, Clarke didn’t dispute that the county records, on their face, will show larger-than-inflation increases.

But he said he is using a different standard: budget increases minus the costs for employee benefits.

The different standard, of course, provides a different picture.

Unless you’ve been been stuck in the deep tunnel for the past decade, you probably have some notion that skyrocketing pension costs after the notorious 2002 pension deal -- plus hyper-generous health insurance for county workers -- have driven up county costs and taxes dramatically.

""As the County has downsized, the ‘legacy’ fringe benefits (obligations for those not still working here) have been spread across fewer employees.  The health care and pension cost increases have been everybody's problem,"" said Stephen Cady, the County Board’s fiscal and budget analyst. ""Each year, departments have had to cut to absorb the growing fringe costs that get allocated to their department.""

Those fringe benefit costs are from active employees, too, not just retirees.

Clarke says that if you remove those fringe costs, his budget requests collectively have come in under the inflation rate.

He’s right -- at least when you compare inflation through 2010 (latest year available) to Clarke’s first eight budgets.

But the inflation comparison works against him if you include 2011, when his request went up 13.4 percent. In that year, we should note, an accounting change involving Clarke’s bailiffs explained a big chunk of the increase.

It’s not surprising that Clarke’s budgets look better by his definition: He’s removed one of the leading -- if not the leading -- inflationary driver in the county budget from his calculations.

That issue affects all departments.

""This is the cost of doing business,"" said Abele spokesman Jeff Bentoff. ""Every department is responsible for the fringe costs associated with their employees.""

Indeed, other departments did not get the benefit of property tax-levy increases the Sheriff’s Department has seen. Abele says the department’s levy has gone up 62 percent in the decade, while Clarke says 37 percent is a fairer number. Either way it’s a big bump compared, for example, with the zero percent increase for the Parks Department, or the drop in levy for transit.

Clarke has trimmed about one in five positions from his agency, thereby eliminating some employee fringe benefit costs. But that underscores he does have some control over those costs.

In any case, Clarke’s leave-out-the-benefits approach is not the conventional way the budget is viewed. Nor did he note that limitation when he made the ear-catching statement.

What’s more, if we looked at every department that way, tens of millions of dollars in county tax dollars would magically disappear from the books -- but not from that tax bill in your mailbox.

Our conclusion

Clarke says he ""never asked for more"" than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets as Milwaukee County sheriff.

It’s true if you overlook the massive fringe benefit increases that have pushed up county costs, frustrating Clarke and every other department head who cut back only to see costs rise. But the bottom line is, Clarke’s redefinition of his budget requests is unofficial and not recorded in county records.

We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA62EC0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/16/david-clarke-jr/clarke-says-hes-never-asked-more-inflationary-incr/

David Quiroa says Rhode Island has allowed illegal immigrants to have drivers licenses in the past
","As controversy swirls over a new policy that lets undocumented students in Rhode Island pay in-state tuition rates at the state’s public colleges, immigrants’ rights advocates are pressing forward on another front: driver’s licenses.

To obtain or renew a driver’s license in Rhode Island, the state Division of Motor Vehicles requires drivers to provide valid Social Security numbers. But someone who is living here illegally can’t get a Social Security number or a driver’s license.

Foreigners in the country legally -- such as those on valid tourist or student visas -- can submit a letter to the DMV from the Social Security Administration explaining that they don’t qualify for a Social Security number. The DMV will then issue these visitors temporary driver’s licenses for the period during which their visas are valid.

Governor Chafee said recently that he is considering changing the state requirements so that people who are living in the country illegally can use taxpayer identification numbers to qualify for a Rhode Island driver’s license.

Three states -- Utah, Washington and New Mexico -- allow people who have no Social Security numbers to use taxpayer identification numbers to apply for driver’s certificates, according to the National Council on State Legislatures. (Unlike driver’s licenses, the certificates cannot be be used for purposes of official identification.)

David A. Quiroa, president of the Guatemalan-American Alliance of  Rhode Island, said in an Oct. 3 news release that during the administration of former Gov. Lincoln Almond, the state Division of Motor Vehicles ""had a program that allowed undocumented families . . . to apply [for] and receive a Rhode Island driver’s license . . . "" (While Quiroa said ""families,"" we understood him to mean individuals.)

We wondered if that was true. Here’s what we found.

The history

In 2000, a group of immigrants’ rights activists, including Quiroa, met with officials from the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles to find a way for undocumented immigrants to be eligible for driver’s licenses.

Quiroa, who was born in New York but grew up in Guatemala, says he proposed the state allow undocumented immigrants to use special tax identification numbers issued by the IRS in place of Social Security numbers for the purpose of getting a driver’s license.

The Individual Taxpayer Identification Number  is a tax processing number available only to certain nonresident and resident immigrants, their spouses and dependents who cannot get Social Security numbers. The nine-digit number begins with the numeral ""9"" and is formatted like a Social Security number.

Quiroa, who at the time was working with the Center for Hispanic Policy and Advocacy, known as CHisPA, said he argued that letting undocumented immigrants use taxpayer identification numbers would also serve as an incentive for them to pay their taxes -- thereby generating more revenue for the state.

Robert L. Carl Jr., then Almond’s director of administration (which at the time oversaw the DMV) said that he supported the idea. ""I wanted to be able to track people down,’’ Carl said recently. ""I wanted to collect their taxes . . . I wanted them to pay car insurance.""  The state police, he recalled, also were in favor of the proposal.

By May 2002, the DMV had adopted new regulations allowing Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers, issued by the IRS, to be used in place of Social Security numbers for obtaining a driver’s licenses. (Applicants for commercial driver’s licenses still had to provide their Social Security numbers.)

The wording of the regulations suggests that the division had already been granting driver’s licenses to some residents without Social Security numbers prior to 2002. However, the division’s interim administrator, Lisa S. Holley, could find no earlier record of the DMV’s policy on the matter.

The rules remained in force for one year.

Then, in May 2003, citing concerns about homeland security and fraud prevention, then-Gov. Donald Carcieri announced that Rhode Island would no longer accept tax identification numbers to obtain driver’s licenses.

A state Department of Transportation official expressed concern at the time about the growth in the number of people using tax identification numbers to obtain or renew driver’s licenses, saying that many of them could be living in the country illegally or owe child support to ex-spouses.

In March 2004, state Rep. Robert A. Watson, R-East Greenwich, sponsored a bill on Carcieri’s behalf that required the DMV to provide the state tax administrator and court administrator with the names, addresses and Social Security numbers of all drivers within 90 days of their license renewals.

The measure was part of a budget article that allowed the DMV to block driver’s license renewals of people who hadn’t paid their taxes.

The requirement was incorporated into Carcieri’s fiscal 2005 budget bill, which the General Assembly passed in June 2004, and incorporated into RI General Laws Chapter 31-3-6.1 and 31-3.6.2.).

Our ruling

Quiroa said that under the Almond administration the DMV allowed undocumented drivers to use their taxpayer identification number from the IRS to obtain a Rhode Island driver’s license.

The division’s regulations show that IRS-issued taxpayer identification numbers could be used for this purpose from May 2002 to May 2003.

Therefore, we rule the statement True.

Map of ship traffic doesn’t show the Suez Canal
","The giant freighter Ever Given has been freed after six days, and other cargo ships are finally moving through the Suez Canal. But the impact of the maritime traffic jam will be felt for a while, says a Facebook post shared on March 29, the day the ship was refloated. The post shows a map of a body of water around the Arabian Peninsula and a dense cluster of triangles, circles and other shapes representing ships apparently bottlenecked in one area.  The Facebook caption reads: ""These are all the cargo ships backed up by the Suez canal. Get ready for shortages and prices to skyrocket.""  The problem with the image: The water in the map isn't the Suez Canal. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We took out our own maps to figure out what the Facebook post was showing, and found that the cluster of ships it depicted was at least a thousand miles away.  The Suez Canal is located in Egypt, and it connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. It’s used heavily as a quick shipping route for cargo ships traveling between Europe and Asia.  The map in the Facebook post shows bodies of water flowing from the Arabian Sea. At the top of the map, between Iran and Saudi Arabia, is the Persian Gulf, and to the south is the Gulf of Aden, between Yemen, Djibouti and Eritrea.  Both areas carry a lot of shipping traffic, but the backup from the Suez Canal didn’t stretch to the Persian Gulf. The posted map was originally created by Marine Traffic, a provider of ship tracking and maritime intelligence.  Georgios Hatzimanolis, media strategist for Marine Traffic, clarified that the map in the Facebook post shows normal traffic in the area, not unusual congestion. Hatzimanolis also explained what the colored shapes mean: green for cargo ships, red for tankers, and blue for passenger ships. As for the second half of the Facebook post, will we see product shortages and skyrocketing prices because of the delays at the Suez Canal? No, says Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The claim that ‘prices will skyrocket’ is a HUGE exaggeration,"" Hufbauer said in an email. ""I don’t think any price surge will be noted in the U.S., and only small blips in Europe at most."" Hufbauer explained that this is because most U.S. imports from Asia come across the Pacific to the West Coast, or through the Panama Canal to the East Coast.  A report from Forbes backs this up, saying that trade with the U.S. will be minimally affected. Additional reports cite a study from analytics companies Dun & Bradstreet and E2open, which says that while industries in the U.S. will be affected, Western Europe will be the region that’s hardest hit. A Facebook post showing a map of maritime traffic says, ""These are all the cargo ships backed up by the Suez Canal. Get ready for shortages and prices to skyrocket.""  The map doesn’t show the Suez Canal. It shows normal traffic in a different area, around the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Aden.

H.R. 1 does not give immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote
","Some social media users are spreading a misleading claim about a Democratic proposal to expand voting rights. They claim that the bill, H.R. 1, gives immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote.  ""For all of you who can’t think for yourself on the left … you cry endlessly about ‘foreign interference’ yet you’re totally ok with allowing ILLEGALS the right to vote by backing H.R. 1,"" reads an Instagram post.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The bill’s goal is to make it easier for eligible American citizens to register to vote. It doesn’t change federal law that bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections.  ""Nothing in the proposed statute would make it legal for noncitizens to register and/or vote,"" said Rebecca Green, professor and co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School. ""There are federal and state criminal sanctions prohibiting noncitizens from registering and voting, which H.R. 1 does nothing to disturb.""  The Instagram post doesn’t include any evidence for its assertions. But claims that the legislation would allow noncitizens to vote have often revolved around its provisions about automatic voter registration.  Under the bill, people interacting with government offices — such as a motor-vehicle    or public-assistance agency — will have their information forwarded to election officials for registration purposes, unless they opt out.  But nothing about this automatic registration allows noncitizens to vote or register to vote. The bill specifically says that only ""eligible citizens"" will be registered under this provision.  If a person’s citizenship status isn’t on file at the government office, that person will have to fill out a registration form attesting to their citizenship. Noncitizens who falsify their citizenship status on one of these applications would be risking criminal sanction, Green said.  Those who violate the law by voting or registering to vote can face incarceration, deportation or fines.  Nearly 20 states and the District of Columbia have already either passed or implemented automatic voter registration, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. There is no evidence that these options have led to significant numbers of noncitizens becoming registered to vote, Danielle Lang, a voting expert at the Campaign Legal Center, previously told PolitiFact.  Opponents of H.R. 1 have pointed to a glitch in California’s automatic voter registration program in 2018, which erroneously registered thousands of people to vote, including at least one noncitizen. Officials said that the error resulted from a programming flaw, and that they canceled the registrations and fixed the system. Any mail-in ballots sent to people who were mistakenly registered weren’t counted on Election Day.  H.R. 1 also contains a provision stating that ineligible immigrants registered in error like the noncitizen in California can’t be prosecuted for their immigration status. But anybody who lies during registration or intentionally misleads officials could still face prosecution.  An Instagram post says that H.R. 1 would give immigrants illegally in the country the right to vote. The bill doesn’t do that. H.R. 1 keeps in place federal and state criminal laws that prohibit noncitizens from voting or registering to vote.

European database does not prove the COVID-19 vaccines are lethal
","As states across the U.S. expand the eligibility for getting a COVID-19 shot, a conservative website blasted out a warning from Europe. The Gateway Pundit claimed two of the vaccines being used in the United States are behind thousands of deaths and injuries in Europe. ""From Europe: 3,964 people have died from adverse drug reactions for COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ – 162,610 injuries,"" said the headline of the March 28 story, which was shared on Facebook. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Gateway Pundit cites information from Global Research, a Canadian website run by the Centre for Research on Globalization, which was accused by NATO of posting conspiracy theories, spreading Russian disinformation and undermining Western media. The post specifically looks at vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, offering a breakdown of the different injuries and deaths purportedly associated with each vaccine using numbers from a European Union-maintained database called EudraVigilance. The implication is the COVID-19 vaccines are harmful and could result in injury or death. However, the numbers are taken out of context to exaggerate the risk of vaccines. The EudraVigilance database itself cautions the information it collects is for ""suspected side effects ... but which are not necessarily related to our caused by the medicine."" ""Information on suspected side effects should not be interpreted as meaning that the medicine or the active substance causes the observed effect or is unsafe to use,"" EudraVigilance’s website says. ""Only a detailed evaluation and scientific assessment of all available data allows for robust conclusions to be drawn on the benefits and risks of a medicine."" Taking the raw data of possible COVID-19 vaccination reactions at face value and using them without context is an oft-used tactic by people attempting to undermine public confidence in the vaccines, according to the New York Times. They frequently interpret the numbers from EudraVigilance or from its United States counterpart, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, as evidence of the vaccines’ dangers.   Since VAERS doesn’t show whether an adverse event was caused by the vaccine or occurred coincidentally, it’s generally not useful on its own for assessing whether a vaccine poses a risk to human health, Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta, previously told PolitiFact. The numbers shared by both the European and American databases have also not been thoroughly vetted independently by scientists. In some cases, the reactions are self-reported. A doctor once successfully reported to VAERS the flu vaccine had turned him into The Hulk, a Marvel Comics character, in an effort to show the possible dangers of blindly relying on the data. It’s too early to tell if the reactions that are being reported are merely coincidental. Regardless, health agencies in the United States and abroad continue to monitor the vaccines’ safety. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been able to confirm extremely rare cases of people developing a severe allergic reaction to their vaccinations. Those reactions occur in about two to five people per 1 million who are vaccinated and can be treated quickly. There hasn’t been any definitive proof that a COVID-19 vaccination led to someone’s death. So far, U.S. regulators have granted emergency use authorization to three vaccines — they come from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The CDC says the vaccines in use in the U.S. are safe and effective.  AstraZeneca has not yet asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine. A possible blood clotting issue, reported in Germany in relation to the AstraZeneca vaccine is currently under study and is said to be extremely rare. While several countries suspended the vaccine’s use for certain groups, a definitive link has not yet been found. A post claimed that in Europe ""3,964 people have died from adverse drug reactions for COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ – 162,610 injuries."" That’s a misrepresentation of information in an European database that tracks suspected reactions to medicines, including COVID-19 vaccines. The agency behind the database cautions that the information is only of suspected side effects, and that it should not be interpreted as meaning that the medicine caused the effects or that it’s unsafe. A detailed evaluation and scientific assessment of all available data is needed before drawing conclusions, the agency said. The COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to millions of people across Europe and the United States, and health agencies have vouched for their safety and effectiveness. We found no definitive proof that a COVID-19 vaccine caused someone’s death.

Facebook post gets it wrong on vote-by-mail under H.R. 1
","An expansive voting rights bill that passed the House has inspired a flood of claims on social media. The measure, known as H.R. 1 or the For the People Act, passed the House narrowly on a near-party-line vote, and the bill is now under consideration in the Senate. A conservative group posted a video to Facebook that calls the bill a ""recipe for disaster."" The video says in part, ""The 2020 election was a procedural nightmare. Many people wonder whether it was fair and honest. And now Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats want to make all of that permanent with what they call the For the People Act. If passed, it would put Congress in charge of our elections. Absentee ballots would be mailed out to anyone without proof of the voter’s identity."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The 2020 election saw record turnout, and widespread use of absentee ballots, due in part to the pandemic. A joint statement by federal and state election officials on Nov. 12 declared the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history."" But here, we will focus on the statement that, if the bill is passed, ""absentee ballots would be mailed out to anyone without proof of the voter’s identity."" In short, it’s inaccurate. The Conservative Caucus did not reply to an inquiry. The group’s statement describes elements of a process used by a handful of states that use ""all-mail elections,"" and suggests that they would be universal if the bill is passed. In all-mail elections, ballots are automatically mailed to every registered voter. ""The voter marks the ballot, puts it in a secrecy envelope or sleeve and then into a separate mailing envelope, signs an affidavit on the exterior of the mailing envelope, and returns the package via mail or by dropping it off,"" according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. This system is used in Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington state and Utah. In addition, California has moved to temporarily extend its use of all-mail voting after adopting it during the coronavirus pandemic. Some all-mail election states offer an in-person alternative for voting as well, but it’s used infrequently. The key point for our analysis of H.R. 1 is that the bill doesn’t force any state to adopt the all-mail system and send out ballots automatically. Rather, the bill’s focus is on making it easier for registered voters who choose to cast their ballot by mail. The bill requires states to give everyone access to voting by mail if they want to use it. And under the bill, those mail ballots would be sent to registered voters who want them, not ""anyone."" Because they’re registered, their identity would already be known to state election officials.  In states that don’t use all-mail voting, voters typically have to request a mail ballot. H.R. 1 would allow eligible voters to request a mail ballot in person, online, by phone, or by mail, and they wouldn’t have to give a reason. Some states currently require a voter to present a valid excuse for voting by mail. In addition, H.R. 1 lets states treat one request for a mail ballot as that voter’s default choice for future elections. The bill doesn’t require this, but it offers states the option. So the video’s claim of ballots being sent ""without proof of the voter’s identity"" is false. The voter would be registered, so their initial application and supporting information would be on file. And in many cases, a voter would have also filed a second form to request a mail ballot.  H.R. 1 says that a valid registration requires the applicant to have ""substantially completed the application form and attested to"" the statements in it.  H.R. 1 also requires that states offer ""automatic voter registration,"" a system by which other state agencies, such as the department of motor vehicles, automatically register new voters,  subject to verification of their eligibility. (Individuals could decline to register by opting out.)  Nationally, nearly 20 states and the District of Columbia already use this system, including such Republican-run states as Alaska and West Virginia. This provision of H.R. 1 is about registering to vote, not mailing ballots. Only in the all-mail states would ballots go out automatically to these newly registered voters. H.R. 1 does require states that aren’t all-mail to send out absentee ballot application forms to all registered voters, no later than 60 days before a federal election. But this provision doesn’t support the claim in the video that ""absentee ballots"" are being mailed out. A ballot application, once completed and returned by the voter, is just a request for a mailed ballot. And under the bill, the application forms would be sent to registered voters only.  The post says that if the voting bill H.R. 1 is passed, ""absentee ballots would be mailed out to anyone without proof of the voter’s identity."" That’s not the case. A few states already do send ballots to all registered voters, but their process would not be changed by the bill. In every other state, registered voters would typically have to request a mail ballot to receive one. The bill would require states to make it easier for voters to do that. The bill would require states to send mail ballot applications to all registered voters before federal elections, but sending an application is not the same thing as sending an actual ballot, and these would go to registered voters only, whose identity and eligibility to vote are known.  We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC04E6C0>],/factchecks/2021/mar/31/facebook-posts/facebook-post-gets-it-wrong-vote-mail-under-hr-1/

Yes, Matt Gaetz was the only no vote on 2017 human trafficking bill
","U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz’s vote against a human trafficking bill back in 2017 is popping up on social media following a New York Times report that federal authorities are investigating whether Gaetz violated human trafficking laws. The New York Times reported based on unnamed sources that the Justice Department is investigating whether Gaetz, a Florida Republican, had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paid for her to travel with him. The newspaper reported that the investigation started during the final months of the Trump administration and is part of a broader investigation into a Gaetz ally, Joel Greenberg, a former tax collector in Seminole County who was indicted on charges including sex trafficking. Gaetz has not been charged. Gaetz said on Twitter and told the New York Times, Axios and Fox News that the allegations are false and are part of an effort to extort $25 million from him and his family.  A Facebook post used the popular ""how it started, how it’s going"" meme to juxtapose the Justice Department investigation with Gaetz’s past vote on a bill in Congress. How it started: ""Matt Gaetz defends lone no vote on anti-human trafficking bill."" How it’s going: ""The DOJ is reportedly investigating whether Rep. Matt Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and violated sex-trafficking laws,"" taken from a Business Insider headline. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In this case, it’s accurate to say that Gaetz was the only member to vote against such a measure in 2017. The Facebook post could be interpreted to suggest that his 2017 vote led to or is somehow tied to the Justice Department investigation, but that isn’t proven, and it’s not the focus of our fact-check. Gaetz really was the only vote against an anti-human trafficking bill that Trump signed into law. The reason he offered at the time was not on the bill’s substance, but in favor of limiting government.  The Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent in September 2017. When the House passed the bill in December 2017, Gaetz was the only no vote. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in January 2018. The bill directed the Transportation Department to designate an official to coordinate human trafficking prevention efforts and called for establishing an advisory committee on human trafficking. The committee submitted a 128-page report in July 2019 that included recommendations to combat human trafficking. Following coverage of his vote in his home newspaper, the Northwest Florida Daily News,  Gaetz went on Facebook live to explain his opposition. Gaetz called the bill ""mission creep"" and an ""expansion of the federal government"" beyond what is in the Constitution.  Gaetz said when a proposed bill creates a new government entity or board, his office scrutinizes the legislation. ""Unless there is an overwhelming, compelling reason that our existing agencies in the federal government can't handle that problem, I vote no because voters in Northwest Florida did not send me to Washington to go and create more federal government,"" Gaetz said. ""If anything, we should be abolishing a lot of the agencies at the federal level like the Department of Education, like the EPA and sending that power back to our state governments."" However, Gaetz said it is important to combat human trafficking — and said when he was in the state Legislaure he worked to make it easier for prosecutors to bring cases against human traffickers. We contacted Gaetz’s congressional office to ask them to point to a bill he appeared to reference but did not receive a reply by our deadline. A Facebook post said Gaetz was the lone vote in the House against an anti-human trafficking bill. In 2017, Gaetz was the lone vote against a bill that directed federal officials to take steps to combat human trafficking, including the creation of an advisory committee. Gaetz said that combating human trafficking was important, but he was against creating a new federal entity to do so. We rate this statement True.

No, the COVID-19 vaccines are not weapons of mass destruction
","In a nearly 22-minute long Facebook video, a man who identifies himself as Dr. Vernon Coleman has a lot to say about the COVID-19 vaccines. The video post is titled, ""Covid-19 [email protected] Are Weapons of Mass Destruction - and Could Wipe out the Human Race."" (The misspelling of ""vaccines"" is intentional — it helps posters avoid Facebook’s moderation of anti-vaccine misinformation.) ""We all know that the evil elite — the Agenda 21 and Great Reset promoters — have all along intended to kill between 90 and 95% of the world’s population,"" Coleman says in the video. ""Sadly I fear it’s already too late to save many of those who’ve had the vaccine. Millions are doomed, and I fear that many will die when they next come in contact with the coronavirus."" Coleman also goes on to reiterate that he believes the vaccines ""could kill more people than COVID-19,"" and that it ""now seems likely that the vaccines may be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions who haven’t been vaccinated.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is not the first time PolitiFact has debunked Coleman’s conspiracy theories about the coronavirus vaccines. The largely self-published British writer has denied the existence of HIV/AIDS and in 2019 authored a book aimed at discrediting trust in vaccines.  A qualified and practicing general practitioner in the 1970s, Coleman is no longer licensed to practice medicine. The UK’s Advertising Standards Authority has also repeatedly taken issue with how Coleman’s work is advertised and promoted.  The video’s claim about the COVID-19 vaccines is rooted in what have come to be referred to as the ""Great Reset"" and ""Agenda 21"" conspiracy theories.  Essentially, the ""Great Reset"" theory is that a group of ""global elites want to use the coronavirus as a tool to reorganize global societies and economies to their benefit at the expense of ordinary people, with the ultimate goal of a global totalitarian regime."" Revived during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ""Agenda 21"" conspiracy theory dates back to a UN document from the early 90s and similarly holds that ""a secret plot to impose a totalitarian world government"" is in motion. There is no evidence to support these widely debunked theories, which have also been linked with the QAnon conspiracy theory. There is also no definitive evidence that deaths have been caused by COVID-19 vaccines. Various fact-checking outlets have reported that there is no clear evidence the coronavirus vaccinations have killed or will kill anyone — let alone kill millions. Even deaths that occur after someone has received a COVID-19 vaccine are not necessarily caused by the vaccine itself. Experts who work with the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a national database that monitors vaccine safety by recording health issues that occur after vaccinations, say that isolated experiences — even deaths — do not establish causation.  Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told PolitiFact that reports of deaths following COVID-19 vaccinations ""can never answer the question of whether a vaccine causes a particular outcome."" Only a study with a control group can establish causation, he said.  The COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people who participated in clinical trials. A video circulating on Facebook claims COVID-19 vaccines are ""weapons of mass destruction"" that ""could wipe out the human race.""   The claim is linked to widely-debunked conspiracy theories about a group of so-called global elites’ ""secret plot"" to create a totalitarian world government and purge a large portion of the planet’s population. There is no evidence to support the claim that the COVID-19 vaccines are ""weapons of mass destruction"" that will cause widespread deaths.  The video’s claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.

No, Biden didn’t put anti-abortion groups on domestic extremist list
","On his third day in office, some two weeks after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden ordered a federal assessment of the threat posed by domestic violent extremism. On March 17, the federal government released an unclassified summary of the assessment, prompting this headline widely shared on Facebook: ""Joe Biden puts pro-life groups on domestic extremist list, calls pro-life people ‘violent.’"" The headline was shared in posts by the Illinois Family Institute, the Facebook group Pro-life Politics, and Ohio Value Voters, Inc. It was surfaced to PolitiFact by VineSight, a firm that tracks online misinformation. The headline distorts what the assessment really found. The intelligence summary says that among the various types of domestic violent extremists are those with ""ideological agendas in support of pro-life or pro-choice beliefs."" In other words, the report doesn’t say that anti-abortion groups — or abortion-rights groups, for that matter — are domestic extremists.  Rather, it says that some groups that are identified as domestic extremists have ideological agendas for or against abortion. The headline shared on Facebook is from an article on LifeNews.com. That article describes another article from the Christian Post about the summary report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  The four-page report, titled ""Domestic Violent Extremism Poses Heightened Threat in 2021,"" begins by stating ""that domestic violent extremists (DVEs) who are motivated by a range of ideologies and galvanized by recent political and societal events in the United States pose an elevated threat to the Homeland in 2021.""  A domestic violent extremist is defined ""as an individual based and operating primarily in the United States without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or other foreign power and who seeks to further political or social goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence."" The report says that lone offenders or small cells of domestic violent extremists ""adhering to a diverse set of violent extremist ideologies"" are more likely to carry out violent attacks than organizations that ""allegedly advocate a DVE ideology."" It also says that ""racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists and militia violent extremists"" present the most lethal threats. The report concludes with a brief mention of abortion-related groups in its listing of five categories of domestic violent extremists: Racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists Anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists Animal rights/environmental violent extremists Abortion-related violent extremists — that is, domestic violent extremists ""with ideological agendas in support of pro-life or pro-choice beliefs""  All other domestic terrorism threats A headline widely shared on Facebook claims that Biden ""puts pro-life groups on domestic extremist list, calls pro-life people ‘violent.’"" An assessment ordered by Biden on the threat posed by domestic violent extremism says that one category of so-called domestic violent extremists are those that have ""ideological agendas in support of pro-life or pro-choice beliefs.""  It does not label anti-abortion groups generally as domestic violent extremists, or as violent.

Georgia voting law does not make it a crime to drop off grandma’s ballot
","Georgia’s newest election law has drawn a series of attacks on social media. ""#Georgia’s new anti-voting law makes it a JAIL-TIME CRIME to drop off grandma’s absentee ballot in a dropbox. #SB202,"" said a Facebook post written by Greg Palast, an investigative freelance reporter who has been published in Rolling Stone and Al Jazeera.  Palast called SB 202 a ""horror show"" and made the same claim on Twitter about criminalizing the return of grandma’s ballot. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So are grandchildren going to be hauled off in handcuffs to jail if they turn in grandma’s absentee ballot? In a word, no.  Palast posted a screenshot of section 47 of SB 202, a sweeping elections bill signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp on March 25. The relevant portion of the law says that anyone who ""accepts an absentee ballot from an elector for delivery or return to the board of registrars except as authorized by subsection (a) of Code Section 21-2-385 shall be guilty of a felony."" Some commenters on Palast’s social media posts noted that those exceptions in that pre-existing Georgia code do allow relatives to return ballots on behalf of a family member. Code Section 21-2-385 says that an elector with an absentee ballot: ""shall then personally mail or personally deliver same to the board of registrars or absentee ballot clerk, provided that mailing or delivery may be made by the elector's mother, father, grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother, sister, spouse, son, daughter, niece, nephew, grandchild, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, or an individual residing in the household of such elector.""  So that means a long list of relatives can legally return a completed ballot on behalf of an elector — including a grandchild for their grandparent. (The section also states that caregivers of disabled electors can mail or deliver completed ballots as can jail employees on behalf of inmates.) Keith Williams, general counsel to House Speaker David Ralston, confirmed that under SB 202 someone can still drop off their own grandma’s absentee ballot in a drop box, mailbox or post office. The law does extend the ban on people who are not relatives or roommates from dropping off someone’s absentee ballot to include drop boxes (unless they fall under other exceptions). In that pre-existing Georgia code, there was no mention of drop boxes. In 2020 drop boxes were allowed under an emergency rule due to the pandemic. Another Georgia law already made unlawful possession of ballots a felony, but SB 202 also makes it clear that unlawful delivery of completed ballots is a felony. The Georgia Secretary of State’s Office also confirmed that someone’s grandchild can still put their absentee ballot in the mail or a drop box under the new law. We emailed Palast and told him that SB 202 and the pre-existing code allows someone to still drop off their own grandma’s absentee ballot or the ballot of another relative. We asked Palast if he saw something else in SB 202 that indicates you can’t submit your own grandmother’s ballot, and did not hear back. A Facebook post stated that Georgia’s new voting law SB 202 ""makes it a JAIL-TIME CRIME to drop off grandma’s absentee ballot in a dropbox."" That’s not the case. Under the new law, a long list of relatives can still legally return a completed ballot on behalf of an elector — including a grandchild for their grandparent.  We rate this claim False.

Donald Trump embellishes details of Dr. Deborah Birx’s Thanksgiving weekend trip
","Former President Donald Trump didn’t appreciate the comments Dr. Deborah Birx made in a CNN report criticizing his administration’s handling of the coronavirus.  Birx, who was coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said the Trump administration failed to give the public clear, consistent guidance. She laid many deaths at the administration’s feet. ""There were about 100,000 deaths that came from that original surge,"" Birx said in the March 28 broadcast featuring several doctors who advised Trump. ""All of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially."" To date, the U.S. death toll is just shy of 550,000. Trump fired back. In a statement, he cast Birx and infectious-disease chief Anthony Fauci, who also appeared on the program, as ""two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts."" He accused Birx of hypocrisy.  ""Who can forget when Dr. Birx gave a huge mandate to the people of our nation to not travel, and then traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving — only to have them call the police and turn her in,"" Trump wrote March 29. ""She then, embarrassingly for her, resigned."" Birx did travel for Thanksgiving. Her family did not call the police.  Here are the details. On Dec. 20, 2020, the Associated Press reported that the day after Thanksgiving, Birx traveled from Washington to a vacation property on Fenwick Island in Delaware, just off Maryland’s Eastern Shore. The group included her husband; a daughter and her husband; and two grandchildren. The 130-mile drive takes about two hours. The CDC Thanksgiving guidance recommended celebrating with ""people in your household,"" and said that ""staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others."" If you do travel, it said, ""always wear a mask in public settings and on public transportation.""  Birx’s trip lasted about two days. During that time, she appeared on CBS News’ ""Face the Nation,"" where she told young people who traveled for Thanksgiving, ""you need to assume that you're infected and not go near your grandparents and aunts and others without a mask. We're really asking families to even mask indoors if they chose to gather during Thanksgiving."" When the AP asked Birx about the trip, she said through a statement from her office that she ""did not go to Delaware for the purpose of celebrating Thanksgiving."" It was more for winterizing her vacation home, the statement said, although the group did share a meal during their stay. At a time when the public message was to stay home, the trip reflected badly on Birx as a public-health official. The AP article quoted two public health researchers who criticized Birx. Angela Rasmussen, a Georgetown virologist, said ""this disqualifies her from any future government health position."" Two days after the AP article, Birx said in an interview that she planned to retire, saying her position ""has been very hard on my family,"" and that they had been dragged ""into this."" In that interview, Birx said she welcomed the chance to help the incoming Biden administration take the reins in fighting the pandemic. Formally, Birx held the position of ambassador-at-large at the State Department, where she had served as global AIDS coordinator. She stepped down on Jan. 20, 2021, the last day of Trump’s term. There is no report that anyone in Birx’s family called the police. We reached out to Trump’s office for their source and did not hear back. The AP said the sister of Birx’s son-in-law brought the matter forward. Slate reported that the sister tipped off the AP and is estranged from the family. The AP said the woman acknowledged there was ""family friction."" Trump said Birx ""traveled a great distance to see her family for Thanksgiving  — only to have them call the police and turn her in. She then … resigned."" Birx took a two-hour drive with her daughter’s family to a vacation home the day after Thanksgiving. The sister of Birx’s son-in-law told the AP, not the police, about the trip. Birx soon announced she would retire, and she stepped down at the end of Trump’s term a month later.

COVID-19 relief for minority farmers not a ‘bonus,’ it’s for past discrimination
","A widely shared Facebook post claims Democrats unfairly favored minority farmers over white farmers. It reads: ""Minority farmers get big bonus. White ones get none. Demonrats are the party of racism & division."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The COVID-19 relief law passed by Democratic majorities in Congress and signed by President Joe Biden in March gives an estimated $5 billion to farmers in ""socially disadvantaged groups"" — that is, racial and ethnic minority groups whose members have been subjected to prejudice. It’s not strictly speaking a ""bonus,"" as the post states. The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was approved 219-212 in the House and 50-49 in the Senate. Democrats hold the majority in both chambers. Two Democrats voted no in the House; none voted no in the Senate.  The American Farm Bureau Federation says the law appropriates an estimated $10.4 billion for programs designed to strengthen the agricultural and food supply chain through, for example, COVID-19 mitigation efforts for agricultural workers and more resources to buy and distribute agricultural commodities to nonprofits. Also in that total is an estimated $5 billion for ""socially disadvantaged"" farmers and ranchers. Federal law defines a ""socially disadvantaged group"" regarding farmers and ranchers as a group whose members ""have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities."" The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that of the $5 billion, $4 billion will be used to provide direct payments of up to 120% of a socially disadvantaged farmer’s or rancher’s outstanding debt — including Black, Hispanic, Native American and Asian Americans — as of Jan. 1, 2021. The additional 20% on top of paying off the debt is intended to pay off the taxes associated with the amount of the direct payment. The other $1 billion will provide outreach, training, education, technical assistance, grants and loans, and funding to educational institutions to help improve land access for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, according to the farm bureau. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and five other Democratic senators introduced in February the Justice For Black Farmers Act, a bill that would provide Black farmers debt relief and access to a land grant program. Booker first introduced the bill on Nov. 30, 2020, but no action was taken.  Under the bill, the Agriculture Department would buy agricultural land from willing sellers at fair market value and convey grants of that land of up to 160 acres to eligible Black individuals at no cost. At least 20,000 land grants would be made each year from 2021 through 2030. We rated as True Booker’s claim that ""there is a direct connection between discriminatory policies within the"" Agriculture Department ""and the enormous land loss we have seen among Black farmers over the past century.""  In 1920, there were about 925,700 Black farmers. In 2017, that number was down to 45,500, a decline dramatically larger than that among white farmers. Bias in the implementation of New Deal policies and other farm assistance programs has been widely documented in Agriculture Department reports and legal settlements between the department and Black farmers. Discriminatory practices meant that Black farmers were continually denied opportunities to expand and modernize their farms, experts say. A Facebook post claims: ""Minority farmers get big bonus, white ones get none,"" because of Democrats. The COVID-19 relief law signed by Biden and approved by Democratic majorities in Congress provides an estimated $5 billion for farmers from socially disadvantaged groups, such as racial minorities, that have been subjected to prejudice. It’s not simply a bonus.  The post is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

While a six-day blockage along the maritime route is rare, groundings are the most common cause of shipping incidents in the canal, with 25 in the past 10 years, according to global business insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE. The strong winds are widely seen as a major factor in this incident. But the Washington Post reported that the Suez Canal Authority said the investigation will not focus just on the weather, and that human and technical errors cannot be ruled out. The incident received around-the-clock news coverage by countless media organizations all over the world and efforts to free the ship involved many people and dozens of organizations.  The Evergreen Line released updates as the grounding situation unfolded, and on March 25 said it would ""continue to coordinate with the shipowner and Suez Canal Authority to deal with the situation with the utmost urgency, ensuring the resumption of the voyage as soon as possible and to mitigate the effects of the incident.""  Crews used tugboats, large-capacity dredgers and high tides to excavate and pull the ship from the canal’s banks. The vessel was freed by around-the-clock digging (workers removed approximately 30,000 cubic meters of sand) and tugs that pushed and pulled it into the middle of the channel. Ever Given’s owner and insurers could face claims for loss of revenue and from other ships whose passage was disrupted, insurers and brokers told Reuters.

Yes, Sen. Cory Booker proposed federal gun licenses and criticized voter ID laws
","Critics and proponents of stricter gun legislation have sought to bolster their arguments with comparisons to restrictions on voting rights.  In one recent example, Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who ran for president in 2020, was painted as a hypocrite for advocating an ID requirement for buying a gun, but opposing such a requirement for voting. ""We must have a federal license and I.D. for gun owners!"" reads the text of a viral image on Facebook, over an image of Booker giving a speech. The text over a second image of Booker reads: ""Voter I.D. laws are racist and discriminatory!""    The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that Booker said the exact quotes from the post. But PolitiFact examined the underlying claim about Booker’s policies on IDs for gun owners and voters, looking at news stories and social media posts about policies he has proposed or endorsed. We found that he has both endorsed licensing for gun buyers and opposed restrictive voter ID laws as discriminatory. A spokesperson for Booker’s office said the post makes an inappropriate comparison. ""This meme wrongly conflates ballots with bullets,"" the spokesperson said. ""The fact is that we urgently need common-sense measures to stem the scourge of gun violence, and we also need to protect every eligible American’s sacrosanct right to vote against unwarranted efforts to impose new barriers based on widely discredited claims about voter fraud."" Booker made national headlines when his short-lived presidential campaign released a plan for a federal gun licensing program as part of a proposal to reduce gun violence. The proposal also included banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, limiting purchases of firearms to one per month and requiring universal background checks.  Booker summarized his federal license policy proposal this way: ""If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to own and operate a gun."" Under Booker’s plan, the FBI would administer the licenses, and people would apply for one at designated locations like the ones used for passports, according to a Vox explainer. Applicants would be required to pay a fee, sit through an interview, pass a background check, attend gun safety training and submit paperwork that included a photo and fingerprints.   After announcing the license plan in May 2019, Booker introduced legislation a few months later — titled the Federal Firearm Licensing Act — to make the proposal a reality. The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee but did not advance further. For years, Booker has publicly criticized restrictive voter ID laws, saying they are not justified by the small risk of fraud. While PolitiFact didn’t find evidence that Booker called voter ID laws ""racist"" as the Facebook post claims, he has publicly criticized voter ID laws as discriminatory and said they unfairly target minorities. During the 2020 campaign, Booker tweeted:  ""Voting rights are still under assault. We’ve watched as: —Voters were purged from rolls
—Voter ID laws targeted people of color
—Elections were stolen We need policy to preserve our right to vote. And it’s a shame we’re still fighting the same struggle of past generations.""  Voting rights are still under assault.

Cory Booker has called for a federal license and ID for gun owners, but opposed voter ID laws.  There’s no evidence Booker used the exact words in the claim, but in broad strokes, the claim accurately represents his positions. Booker has introduced legislation that would create a federal license requirement to own a gun. He has also criticized restrictive voter ID laws, saying they ""targeted people of color"" and are responsible for denying people their right to vote.

Attack ad overreaches in state appeals court race
","A typically low-profile race for state appeals court has taken a contentious and partisan turn due to a series of attack ads against the incumbent. Judge Jeff Davis was appointed to the District II Court of Appeals by Gov. Tony Evers in 2019. One of the people who unsuccessfully applied for that position, Muskego Municipal Judge Shelley Grogan, is now running against Davis in the April 6 election. Though the position is nonpartisan, the race has taken a distinctly partisan flavor as ads from Grogan and a third-party group link Davis and Evers in the obligatory ominous voiceover. An ad running on WTMJ and WISN radio the weeks leading up to the election touted Grogan’s law enforcement endorsements, then said this: ""Jeff Davis just can’t be trusted to keep our communities safe. In fact, Jeff Davis spent years defending a convicted cop killer, who murdered a correctional officer in cold blood. The killer was sentenced to death row, and Jeff Davis tried to get him off the hook."" It’s a classic attack ad narrative — and one that screams for additional context. Let’s check out the situation referenced here and whether the ad gets it right. In 1987, William Van Poyck and Frank Valdes attacked a prison transport in West Palm Beach, Florida, attempting to free a convicted killer being taken for skin cancer treatment. Van Poyck told a jury that he masterminded the ambush, according to the Palm Beach Post. And one of the prison guards said Van Poyck held a gun to his head and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired. The other guard, Fred Griffis — a decorated U.S. Army Ranger who served in Vietnam — was shot and killed. Van Poyck and Valdes both claimed at trial that the other had killed Griffis, but both were convicted and sentenced to death since being part of a deadly crime is sufficient under Florida law. Van Poyck spent decades on death row before he was executed by lethal injection in June 2013. Throughout most of the post-conviction appeals process, Van Poyck was represented by Davis, who was a civil litigator with Quarles & Brady at the time. Davis was urged to take the case as a young associate by the American Bar Association, which has a program to recruit pro bono counsel from large law firms for complex cases, his campaign website says. Davis said in an email he ""thought it would be a good experience for me in developing trial and appellate skills."" Davis ended up representing Van Poyck — largely on his own — from 1992 until the execution. He asked to be removed from the case in the late 1990s when expected support from a federal resource center disappeared, but a judge denied the request and Davis didn’t ask again. ""As time went on and my institutional knowledge of the case accumulated, I felt it would be entirely inappropriate and possibly constitute client abandonment if I were to do so,"" Davis said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Davis said he pursued the case in hopes of having the death sentence reduced to life in prison. Despite the tone of the ad, it’s hardly an activity Davis sought to hide. He detailed it in the letter he wrote to Evers seeking the judicial appointment he eventually received. In a letter to the Florida governor seeking a last-minute stay of execution in 2013, Davis said Valdes’ widow had recently provided a sworn statement that Valdes — who was beaten to death by prison guards in 1999 —  confessed to her that he killed the guard, not Van Poyck. Davis said jurors had indicated in affidavits their verdict ""would have been different had they known the truth."" The governor declined to intervene, however. With that context, let’s circle back to the ad. Grogan says Davis ""spent years defending a cop killer."" The ad goes on to reference the death of a correctional officer, but it exaggerates a bit on the ""cop killer"" line. That’s a term traditionally applied only to police officers. The ad also says Davis ""tried to get (Van Poyck) off the hook."" Again, this overreaches. Davis was certainly seeking to change the sentence from death row to life behind bars, but he wasn’t seeking to overturn the conviction — the impression listeners could be left with from the ad’s choice of words. In short, Davis was filling a role required by the American criminal justice system. Michael O’Hear, a professor at Marquette University Law School, said it’s important to recognize the need for good legal representation even for people accused of the most serious crimes. He noted hundreds of people have ultimately been exonerated in serious cases like murder and rape through evidence solicited and presented by their attorneys. ""People who are accused of serious crimes have a constitutional right to competent legal representation,"" O’Hear said in an email. ""The right to legal representation may be most important for those individuals who have been accused of committing the most heinous offenses."" The District II Court of Appeals, based in Waukesha, is a four-judge panel that hears cases passed up from circuit courts in Calumet, Fond du Lac, Green Lake, Kenosha, Manitowoc, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Walworth, Washington, Waukesha and Winnebago counties. It’s a noteworthy position since it can be a stepping stone to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, as it was for Justice Brian Hagedorn, whose former post Davis and Grogan are seeking. In an attack ad, Grogan said Davis ""spent years defending a convicted cop killer"" and ""tried to get him off the hook."" Davis did indeed spend 21 years working on the Van Poyck case, seeking to have his sentence reduced from the death penalty to life in prison. But the ad exaggerates on key points. ""Cop killer"" isn’t quite an accurate description of a man convicted of killing a prison guard. And the ""off the hook"" phrasing overstates the situation since the appeals weren’t seeking to overturn the conviction, just the death penalty. Most notably, the overall tone of the ad implies something nefarious about the representation when Davis was filling a role mandated by the judicial system — and doing it for free. We define Half True as a statement that ""is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8CD3C0>],/factchecks/2021/mar/30/shelley-grogan/attack-ad-overreaches-state-appeals-court-race/
