Effect of net neutrality rules on taxes is uncertain
","Does net neutrality mean a big tax increase? The Federal Communications Commission just approved a proposal reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications utility -- claiming that it will preserve the concept of net neutrality. While proponents of the policy shift argue that the changes won’t spur additional fees or taxes, opponents argue the opposite. ""This is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what is going on,"" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an email through the anti-FCC regulation group Protect Internet Freedom. On the other hand, FCC spokesperson Kim Hart told PolitiFact that the policy ""does not raise taxes or fees. Period."" Who’s right here? Estimates of the impact on consumers -- in terms of Internet service bill fees and taxes -- range from $0 to $11 billion. Politicians can make a case that the policy will bump up service bills for the 85 million households with Internet, but there are too many unknowns to make such a definitive statement as Lee’s. The proposal Net neutrality is complicated. In general, it’s the idea that Internet service providers (like Comcast) should not be able give preferential treatment to one website over another. Accordingly, the solution is also complex. The FCC voted to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning they will be treated as public utilities, like phone service -- subject to more regulation than they are now. (A previous fact-check covered this in more detail.) The full text of the proposal wasn’t available to the public before the vote, when Lee made his comments, though its general principles were widely understood. But, a fact sheet says it ""will not impose, suggest or authorize any new taxes or fees."" More importantly, Congress recently reauthorized the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bans new taxes on Internet service. There’s legislation in the works to make this law permanent. That means the FCC couldn't levy taxes on its own even if it wanted to.  There’s a big caveat, though. The Internet Tax Freedom Act bans taxes, but not fees. Fee revenue is set aside specifically for, in this case, a telecom-related service. Taxes, in contrast, raise general revenue. They’re legally different, but functionally the same from the consumer’s perspective. Many experts say consumers can expect additional fees. Some say the FCC has left the door open for attaching federal-level fees in the future. Regardless, the FCC can’t stop states and municipalities from tacking on their own fees. The estimates The nationwide annual impact on Internet broadband subscriber bills could reach a maximum $11 billion, as a result of new taxes and fees, according to a December report out of the Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left think tank (it identifies with former President Bill Clinton’s New Democrats). They recently lowered their estimate from $15 billion. For the study, the researchers assumed that state and local governments would take every fee currently applied to a telecom service and apply them to internet service -- because household Internet will become a telecom service. For example, the state of California charges telecom companies fees for special telecom-related services for the deaf and disabled, among other programs. Companies then pass these fees along to consumers. It makes sense that a state would want to apply already-established telecom fees to Internet service to increase revenue, said study author Hal Singer, in an interview with PolitiFact. He pointed out that Vermont’s director of telecom services has said the state would strongly consider levying fees on broadband Internet for the purpose of increasing Internet accessibility. Some net neutrality experts take issue with the study because of what the authors chose to include or leave out. ""The PPI study has been thoroughly discredited,"" said Joshua Stager, policy counsel at the Open Technology Institute, noting that it was ""disingenuous"" of the study to ignore the Internet Tax Freedom Act in the first place. There is no guarantee that every state would choose to levy every fee. In some states, the legislatures would have to take action before it could happen. The report also assumes that federal fees will apply, but that’s still up in the air. Taking a different look at the PPI findings, the Free Press advocacy group argues that the potential fee burden could be around $4 billion, or as little as nothing. (Though Singer fervently rebutts their argument.) Personal finance website Nerd Wallet did their own assessment and settled on a possible $6.25 billion impact. They broke their estimates down by state and found that households would see an annual increase in their Internet service bills anywhere between $8 in Delaware and $131 in Pennsylvania. They estimate that the average American household will see their bill increase $67 annually. ""I’d say claiming that this order will be a ‘massive tax on the middle class,’ is an overstatement,"" said Doug Brake, telecom policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. ""But it is also true that we will likely see new fees on broadband as a result of reclassification."" Our ruling Lee said the FCC’s net neutrality policy ""is essentially a massive tax increase."" Literally, there won’t be any new taxes as a result of the FCC changes, but there will likely be additional fees. There’s a wide range of estimates -- anywhere from zero to $11 billion a year. Lee’s comment doesn’t account for the fact that the impact on consumers’ service bills is far from certain, and a telecom policy analyst said it's an overstatement to call the potential increases ""massive."" The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3A1040>],/factchecks/2015/feb/26/mike-lee/effect-net-neutrality-rules-taxes-uncertain/

Pro-pot group says Debbie Wasserman Schultz repeatedly voted to send sick patients to prison
","As U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., weighs a potential presidential bid in 2016, a long list of politicians are considering whether to run for his Senate seat. That includes U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Weston, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, according to a Politico report on Feb. 17. (She’s not a lock on the Democratic side. A Tampa Bay Times Florida Insider Poll suggests U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Palm Beach County and newly elected U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham of Leon County could also be strong contenders.) One group was quick to attack Wasserman Schultz’s potential candidacy: The pro-pot lobby. Last year, she opposed Florida’s medical marijuana ballot initiative, which received almost 58 percent support, two points shy of passage. She also voted against a congressional amendment supported by advocates for medical marijuana. ""She’s voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison. And we’re certainly going to make sure Floridians know that — not to mince words,"" Bill Piper, national affairs director with the Drug Policy Alliance, told Politico. Did Wasserman Schultz repeatedly take votes to send dying patients to prison? Politico reported in a follow-up article that Wasserman Schultz offered to change her opposition if Orlando lawyer John Morgan, the force behind the Florida ballot initiative, stopped bashing her, which she denied in an interview with the Sun Sentinel. Morgan hopes to get a revised version on the ballot in 2016. Wasserman Schultz’s marijuana voting record The Drug Policy Alliance pointed to several of Wasserman Schultz’s votes, including on a congressional amendment that banned the use of federal money to interfere with state medical marijuana laws. The goal of the amendment, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., was to prevent federal agents from raiding retail operations in states where medical pot is legal. (We looked at a similar claim by another pro-pot group about her vote in 2014.) Wasserman Schultz, one of 17 Democrats in the House to vote against the amendment on May 30, 2014, said she didn’t want to ""limit the executive branch’s ability to enforce current federal law at their discretion."" The language was attached to another bill and signed into law in December. (She voted against similar failed amendments four times between 2005 and 2012.) Her vote on those amendments ""was very much focused on patients, and the fear of arrest they and their caregivers live under,"" Piper told PolitiFact Florida. He also argued that the Florida ballot measure -- which Wasserman Schultz opposed -- would have protected patients using medical marijuana.   Last year, she said the Florida ballot initiative was ""written too broadly and stops short of ensuring strong regulatory oversight from state officials."" Piper also pointed to Wasserman Schultz’s ""no"" vote on an April 2014 congressional amendment on a spending bill for Veterans Affairs. The amendment, which failed, would have allowed VA doctors to talk to their patients about medical marijuana in states in which it is legal. But it’s a stretch to say that her ""no"" vote means she wants dying patients to go to prison. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Sean Bartlett told the Washington Post at the time that she felt it was premature to vote on the amendment. She wanted to wait for the results of a study approved by the federal government to look at marijuana’s potential effects on post-traumatic stress disorder. Do feds put terminally ill patients in prison? Do these votes mean she repeatedly voted to send terminally ill patients to prison? That’s a stretch. Even before her 2014 congressional votes, there were reasons that users were not a priority for the feds. In 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys telling them to focus on cartels or other criminal organizations. Beyond that, the Justice Department said it was content to allow state and local agencies ""to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws."" The pro-pot lobby has pointed to cases of growers prosecuted for serving ill patients, including transplant recipient Jerry Duval, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Duval was a state-registered caregiver but prosecutors argued he peddled pot to non-patients. One high-profile case remains pending -- initially dubbed Kettle Falls 5, named for defendants in eastern Washington. Prosecutors say the five defendants were conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana, and they were also charged with possessing firearms. One defendant, Larry Harvey, told USA Today that the pot he grew was for personal medical use. On Feb. 18, the Justice Department dropped the charges against Harvey, 71, who was recently diagnosed with stage-four pancreatic cancer. However, the charges remain for his wife, two other relatives and a family friend. Law professors we interviewed told us that the federal government hasn’t focused on individuals who simply use marijuana for their own medical needs, and that was true even before the congressional amendment passed. ""The feds don't send people to prison for using marijuana,"" Vanderbilt law Professor Robert Mikos told PolitiFact Florida. ""They do deny some benefits to users (like access to some VA services). And the law authorizes prison for users. But the law is not enforced so rigidly."" George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the amendment passed last year ""may well constrain federal prosecution of medical marijuana suppliers in states where their activities are legal."" However, he added, the fact that the Kettle Falls case is still going forward shows such prosecutions still can happen. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz ""voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison,"" Piper said. She voted against amendments to ban the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. In theory, advocates believe that the amendment -- which passed late in 2014 after multiple attempts -- prevents the feds from going after sick marijuana users in states that allow medical marijuana. However, even before the amendment passed, dying patients who simply smoked joints that they obtained legally were not being hauled off to prison en masse by federal agents. Instead, the federal government focused on major suppliers or distributors. Saying Wasserman Schultz voted to send people to prison significantly exaggerates the issue. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D95DC0>],/factchecks/2015/feb/26/drug-policy-alliance/pro-pot-group-says-debbie-wasserman-schultz-repeat/

Investor in Red Sox minor league team says most Triple A teams play in government owned parks
","A group of investors, including the president of the Boston Red Sox,  announced Monday that they had bought the Red Sox Triple A franchise, the the Pawtucket Red Sox. In doing so, they revealed they want to move the team to Providence and build a new 10,000-seat stadium on land that became available after the relocation of Route 195. Home runs over the right-field wall would land in the Providence River. Details of the project are still emerging. On Tuesday, the new owners told The Providence Journal that they planned to build the stadium with their own money but were exploring various public-subsidy options, including asking the state to give them the land, which had  been earmarked for a public park. One of the new owners, lawyer James J. Skeffington, was asked what such a public-partnership might look like in an interview Tuesday with reporter Gene Valicenti on WPRO-AM. ""You know, there’s only 30 cities that have Triple A teams in the United States, in major league baseball. And virtually every one of them [is] playing in government owned ballparks,"" Skeffington said. He went on to say that such arrangements were a way for cities and towns to induce the owners of those Triple A teams to play there. We wondered if Skeffington was right about the number of publicly-owned ballparks. We reached out to Skeffington, who told us his information was based on a consultant’s report that he would provide to us. After we called Skeffington, we contacted each of the 30 Triple A teams to find out who owns their ballpark. We learned that only three were privately owned: Security Service Field, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox’s stadium; BB and T Ballpark, home of the Charlotte Knights;  and Raley Field, the Sacramento River Cats’ ballpark. Skeffington identified four stadiums as being privately owned, but our research concluded that one of those ballparks -- Aces Ballpark in Reno, Nev. -- is, in fact, publically owned. That park has been owned by the City Redevelopment Agency of Reno since 2013, according to Eric Edelstein, president of the Reno Aces. We note that there is much debate over whether public support for professional sport teams, such as helping to build stadiums, is a wise use of public money. That is beyond the scope of this fact-check. Our ruling James Skeffington said that ""virtually"" all of the 30 Triple A teams play in government-owned ballparks. Our research found that 27 of the 30 stadiums those teams play in are owned by a city, county or other government entity, as seen in Reno. We note that the word virtually is not an absolute. Given that, we rate the claim as True.

The odd reality of Iran's centrifuges: Enough for a bomb, not power
","The deadline for an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program is something of a moving target, but right now negotiators need to wrap things up by June 2015. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States — along with Germany, have until then to strike a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Iran’s stock of enriched uranium and freezes the country’s capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. One element that’s fully expected in a long-term arrangement is a limit on the number and kinds of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uranium. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell said there’s an irony in that. ""If you are going to have a nuclear weapons program, 5,000 is pretty much the number you need,"" Morell, now a CBS analyst, said on Charlie Rose. ""If you have a power program, you need a lot more. By limiting them to a small number of centrifuges, we are limiting them to the number you need for a weapon."" Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morell’s basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than you’d need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just one negotiating point out of many. The consensus among the experts we reached is that Morell is on the money. Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University told PunditFact the Morell is ""is absolutely correct.""  Ditto for Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association and David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security. Matthew Bunn at Harvard agreed with his colleagues.  ""People think surely you must need a bigger enrichment system to make 90 percent enriched material for bombs than to make 4-5 percent enriched material for power reactors,"" Bunn said. ""But exactly the opposite is true."" Bunn said there are two reasons. First, you need tens of tons of material to fuel a power reactor for a year, but just tens of kilograms to make a bomb. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the threshold amount for a bomb is about 25 kilograms of the most highly enriched U-235. And while yes, it’s harder to make 90 percent enriched uranium (bomb) than 4-5 percent enriched uranium (power), it’s not that much harder, Bunn said. The toughest part in the process comes when you start with the raw uranium. By the time you’ve brought that to 4-5 percent, ""you’ve already done more than 2/3 of the work of going all the way to 90 percent U-235 for weapons,"" Bunn said. ""So the amount of work needed to make bomb material is only a modest amount more per kilogram, and the number of kilograms you need for bombs is 1,000 times less. Bottom line: Making bombs takes fewer centrifuges. And without a lot of centrifuges, it’s hard to make nuclear power. For the record, some centrifuge models are better than others, so that's also a factor. Today, Iran has just one nuclear power station, the plant at Bushehr that it bought from the Russians. To keep that facility running, Iran would need to increase its centrifuge capacity ten-fold. A steady supply of fuel from Russia is what keeps Bushehr online. Centrifuges and a nuclear deal This fact that bombs require fewer centrifuges than power is a source of frustration for Albright, a physicist with the Institute for Science and International Security. ""I wish it were reversed,"" he told us. ""Then we could easily tell if the program was for weapons."" As the clock clicks down to reach an agreement, the number of centrifuges and their level of sophistication will draw a lot of scrutiny. Kimball, of the Arms Control Association, said the specific terms on this front will have to resolve a crucial question: ""What are Iran’s practical needs, and how do you square that with international concern about the real purpose?"" Ideally, Kimball said, Russia or another nation would continue to supply the fuel, but barring that, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany aim to put on cap on the number of centrifuges for as many years as possible. Allowing about 5,000 would help. ""With that, it would take 12 months for Iran to produce enough material for one bomb,"" Kimball said. ""That would give you enough time to detect that activity."" But Bunn underscored that an agreement would have many moving parts and a key element would be the number of years that Iran agreed to rein in its centrifuge capacity. ""Because the sides have already agreed in the (interim agreement) that after the agreement expires, Iran is to be treated like other parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That would mean it could build up its enrichment capacity to have enough to fuel Bushehr or even more reactors,"" Bunn said. The variables don’t stop there. If Iran ramped up production of fuel for nuclear power, it would need a ready supply of raw ore, which it might need to purchase on the international market. During his interview with Charlie Rose, Morell warned that the focus on declared centrifuges is misplaced, because he expects that if Iran were to try to build a bomb, it would do so in secret. The only protection against that, Morell said, is unannounced inspections at any place in the country at any time. Our ruling Morell said that it takes fewer centrifuges to make bomb-grade nuclear material than it does to supply fuel for a nuclear power plant and argued that the focus on centrifuges can go too far. That argument aside, experts agreed that Morrell has his facts right. A power plant requires tons of fuel each year. A bomb requires about 25 kilograms of U-235 enriched to the 90 percent level. If an agreement limits Iran to about 9,000 centrifuges, that would be sufficient to produce enough bomb-grade material but would leave Iran well short of the capacity to generate fuel to power nuclear power plants. We rate Morrell’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096899680>],/factchecks/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/
"['Labor', 'Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin Contractor Coalition']","
Contractors say business support for ""right to work"" law is minimal
","More than 400 Wisconsin firms in construction contracting oppose the Republican push for a ""right-to-work"" law, which would block companies and workers from signing agreements requiring employees to pay union dues. Here’s how they explain their stance: They’re fine with the current set up, under which they employ 120,000 trades workers -- most in unions -- and collaborate with the unions on training, wages and workplace safety. This, the Wisconsin Contractor Coalition claims, helps attract new business and jobs, while right to work ""compromises each of these, infringes on the rights of private businesses and is a detriment to Wisconsin’s overall economy and tax base."" Meanwhile, state manufacturing firms and some other big businesses are rallying on the other side, contending Wisconsin workers deserve the freedom to work and receive the benefit of unions without paying dues. The Contractor Coalition’s website makes this claim about Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby: ""WMC’s own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation."" That would be a jaw-droppingly low number. Let’s check the evidence. Surveying WMC members Twice in the last seven months, WMC has publicized some results from surveys of executives whose firms belong to the group. We’ve reported on the limitations of these surveys before: They don’t represent a random sample of the group’s membership or of businesses statewide. A small minority of CEOs typically respond to the questions. And the group does not publicly post the wording of questions. During the summer 2014, the survey sent to 1,200 executives asked for the top thing state government could do to improve the business climate. In all, 261 execs filled out the survey. From a list of eight concerns, the top change sought was ""reduce taxes"" (35 percent), a WMC news release reported. Second was ""become a right to work state"" (15 percent), WMC spokesman Jim Pugh told us. Trailing that, in no particular order, were education reform/school choice, affordable health care, reduce regulations, tort reform, reduce spending and economic development. Pugh said 15 percent making it their top priority was a ""huge number."" But Stephen Lyons, a spokesman for the Contractor Coalition, argues the result showed the lack of urgency among WMC members on right to work. The trouble here for the Contractor Coalition is that the survey did not gauge support for right to work, as it claimed. Rather, it showed the intensity level executives felt about right to work when compared to other priorities. The coalition’s website, where the claim was made, went live in December 2014. At that time, the survey was the most recent by WMC on the topic. Since then, WMC released partial results from a survey that ended in January 2015. That survey directly asked: ""Would you support state legislation to allow individual private sector workers the freedom to decide whether or not they want to join a labor union (Right to Work) or do you support current Wisconsin law that mandates union membership (Closed Shop)?"" The question is flawed because it misstates current law, three veteran employment and labor attorneys -- Mark Sweet, Michael Aldana and Peter Davis -- told us in separate interviews. Since at least 1947, ""closed shops"" -- which require that only union members be hired -- have been illegal. Under current law, unions and the company can agree on contracts that require newly hired employees to pay the equivalent of union dues. In these so-called ""union shops"" workers do not have to join the union but pay a share of the unions costs for collective bargaining and other services. A right to work law would bar employers from entering into these type of agreements. Twenty-four states have such laws on the books. One footnote: As a practical matter, in the construction industry, many collective bargaining agreements require employers to hire through union halls, though non-union workers can also get on hiring hall lists. In addition, the WMC question’s phrasing is tilted toward right to work with the positive ""freedom"" description while inaccurately describing current law as a mandate. With those major caveats in mind, here’s what the 2015 WMC survey found: 81 percent (250 of 308 respondents) favored a right to work law. The Contractor Coalition calls that number misleading, saying WMC has 3,600 members, so only 7 percent came forward to say the favored right to work. Maybe so. But the survey went out to 1,200 executives, not the full membership. And the coalition’s own claim clearly referred to the favorability rating among ""respondents"" to the survey. Our rating The Wisconsin Contractor Coalition claimed: ""WMC’s own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation."" This is a misstatement of the WMC survey results, the first of which showed 15 percent of respondents wanted right to work as their number one priority, but were not asked whether they favored it. The second survey, though flawed as noted, found 81 percent of responding executives favored right to work. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFCF80>],/factchecks/2015/feb/25/wisconsin-contractor-coalition/contractors-say-business-support-right-work-law-mi/

Report accurate on decline in federal transportation dollars
","Georgia lawmakers are struggling to come up with $1 billion annually for road and bridge work, and they see nothing to suggest Uncle Sam will be lending much help -- let alone extra money. For decades, states have been receiving money each year from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. But those dollars have been shrinking of late for all but Alaska and New York. Last weekend, The Associated Press published a national analysis of Federal Highway Trust Fund spending between 2008 and 2013, the latest year for which figures were available. It showed overall trust fund money to the states was down 3.5 percent during that period. Based on population, Georgia saw the third sharpest decline in awards for the period -- down 12 percent. Only Minnesota and Washington took bigger hits, AP reported. With transportation a top issue to Atlanta commuters and business leaders and one of the hottest topics of debate in this year’s General Assembly session, PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig a little deeper. First, a little background on the trust fund, its history and its role in the angst playing out under Georgia’s Gold Dome and in other state capitols. Congress funded construction of interstates and some other roads through the general fund until 1956 when the Federal Highway Trust Fund was established, using proceeds from the federal fuel tax of 18.3 cents a gallon on gasoline and 24.4 cents a gallon on diesel fuel and related excise taxes. The trust fund had an $8 billion shortfall in 2008, attributed to higher gas prices and lower gas consumption driven by the recession, that had to be covered with money from the general fund. Similarly, $7 billion had to be transferred to the fund in 2009, and $19.5 billion in 2010. Congress passed a stopgap plan last year to prevent a funding lapse, and the trust fund could again be on the chopping block in May without intervention. Some states have responded by proposing new taxes, tolls and fees. Leaders in the Georgia House have proposed a bill to raise $1 billion for transportation, an issue they acknowledge is critical to the state’s long-term growth. The plan’s backers also say it will decrease Georgia’s reliance on federal funding for road upkeep. In 2014, about $1.2 billion, or more than 54 percent of the state DOT budget came from federal funds. ""The more independent we can be from the federal government, the better off we are long term,"" Seth Millican, director of the Georgia Transportation Alliance, an arm of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, said last week. Mick Bullock, spokesman for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said transportation funding is ""an issue states are grappling with all around the country. ""Pending what happens in Congress with the Highway Trust Fund, state legislatures need a long-term funding solution for their transportation infrastructure,"" Bullock said. ‘if Congress does not act, states will have to look at other funding solutions."" Now to the numbers. The Georgia Department of Transportation provided us with data on the sizable dollars that flowed to road projects in the state from the federal trust fund in the period that had been reviewed. Georgia received $8.14 billion in 2008 to 2013 -- including (with rounding) $1.44 billion in 2008; $1.36 billion in 2009; $1.4 billion in 2010; $1.37 billion in 2011; $1.3 billion in 2012 and $1.27 billion in 2013. By our calculations, that was a net loss of about 12 percent. We asked for data for the five prior years -- thinking that might provide additional light. In the five prior years, we saw the state’s annual allotment from the trust fund go up almost every year, (with rounding) $1 billion in 2003; $1.22 billion in 2004; $1.27 billion in 2005; $1.23 million in 2006; and $1.34 billion in 2007. Overall, in that period, Georgia’s funding through the trust fund increased at a steady clip -- about 34 percent. Our ruling. The money Georgia receives from the Federal Highway Trust Fund fell by more than 12 percent in 2008 through 2013. State and federal data we reviewed backs up that finding by The Associated Press. We rate the statement True.

Facebook meme quotes Sheila Jackson Lee saying 'wrinkly... has-beens' should die
","Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee can be a firecracker of a public speaker. But we were skeptical of a Facebook meme, shared online Feb. 7, 2015 and brought to our attention by a reader. The meme showed Jackson Lee, a Houstonian initially elected to the House in 1994, saying: ""Hey, all you wrinkly, white-aged has-beens: It’s time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet."" A web search led us to similar though less racially charged language posted by Stand Up for the Truth, a Wisconsin-based weekday religious public affairs program, in a November 2012 web post critical of the United Nations. The post opened: ""Hey all you wrinkly, middle-aged has-beens: Are you ready to move over and let the next generation have your spot on the planet? After all, you’ve lived a good life. And your aging body is going to cost taxpayers a lot more than the salt you think you are worth. In other words, your return-on-investment isn’t looking so good to the United Nations."" By email, the program’s co-host, Amy Spreeman, said she recalled ""coming up with the term, ‘wrinkly has-been’ for that article. I'm a descriptive writer who also happens to be seeing a few wrinkles in my own mirror,"" Spreeman wrote. Our Google and Nexis news database searches for signs of Jackson Lee saying such words came up empty. We also asked the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the activities of hate groups, if it had noticed such words from the Texan.

Did the health care law give 'elevated legitimacy' to alternative medicine?
","Editor's note, Feb. 25, 2015: One of the core principles of our work, and the work of all journalists, is to contact the subjects whom we are writing about. In this fact-check, we didn’t meet our high standards. While we emailed Jonah Goldberg five days before publishing our fact-check, we never followed up with a phone call or another email to see if he had seen our questions. And while we also attempted to contact Goldberg’s source, Kevin Williamson, we did so only by Twitter. That’s not good enough in our book. Goldberg has since responded to this fact-check via a column on NationalReview.com. While there is nothing in his response that changes our Half True rating, we should have made every attempt to reach him so he could make his points prior to publication. For that, we are sorry. PolitiFact has published literally hundreds of fact-checks on President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, so it’s always a surprise when a reader stumps us with a fresh claim they’ve run across. Recently, a reader sent us a column from the conservative National Review that said the law gives preferred treatment to non-traditional forms of medicine. The column was from Jonah Goldberg, citing the work of another National Review writer, Kevin Williamson. ""As my National Review colleague Kevin Williamson notes, ‘Everybody wants to know what Scott Walker and Sarah Palin think about evolution, but almost nobody is asking what Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama think about homeopathy, acupuncture, aromatherapy and the like.’ Even though such remedies have been given elevated legitimacy under the Affordable Care Act."" We wondered: Is Goldberg right that the law gives ""elevated legitimacy"" to such non-traditional techniques? It turns out there’s a solid core of truth to the claim, but also some important caveats. (Neither Williamson nor Goldberg returned inquiries for this fact-check.) Where the claim has a point In recent years, the use of ""complementary and alternative medicine"" (also called ""integrative health care"") has grown substantially. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found that roughly four of every 10 American adults and one of every nine children uses at least one form of alternative medicine. That category includes such fields as acupuncture, chiropractic, diet therapies (such as the Atkins, Ornish, South Beach or vegetarian diet), homeopathy, hypnosis, massage therapy, tai chi and yoga. Following a lobbying campaign by alternative-medicine practitioners, and assistance from then-Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, several provisions favorable to non-traditional forms of medicine were inserted into the health care law. Here are provisions that stand to benefit complementary and alternative medicine: • Section 3502 establishes grants for medical homes. The law says that the interdisciplinary teams supporting such homes may include ""licensed complementary and alternative medicine practitioners"" and ""doctors of chiropractic."" • Section 4001 establishes the National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council and, in turn, an advisory group on prevention, health promotion, and integrative and public health issues. • Section 4206  creates a pilot program to provide at-risk individuals who use community health centers with ""individualized wellness plans"" designed to reduce risk factors for preventable conditions, including integrative health techniques. • Section 5101 creates a National Healthcare Workforce Commission and expands the definition of the health care workforce to include integrative health care practitioner, licensed complementary and alternative medicine provider, and doctors of chiropractic. • Section 6301 establishes the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to fund research that determines which medical techniques work best. Some of the institute’s research addresses alternative medicine, including a study of ""non-pharmacologic strategies to reduce pain and depression,"" as well as efforts to compare acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia among cancer survivors. The institute is also funding studies of ""relaxation and mindfulness exercises,"" massage, yoga, meditation, and breathing exercises. All told, the institute is spending $4.1 million for studies involving alternative medicine, or about 3.5 percent of its funding to date on this type of study. Findings from this research could become significant, since many alternative medicine therapies have not yet faced rigorous scientific testing -- a key prerequisite for getting insurance companies to pay for them. Potentially the most far-reaching provision, however, is Section 2706. Alternative-medicine advocates say this section stipulates that as long as an alternative-medicine practitioner is fully licensed by a state, insurance companies must reimburse them just as they do medical doctors. (Literally, the section says that ""a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall not discriminate with respect to participation under the plan or coverage against any health care provider who is acting within the scope of that provider's license or certification under applicable state law."") Put all of these elements together and Goldberg has a point. Where the claim overstates the case That said, it’s important to note some limitations in how the health care law is treating alternative medicine in practice, rather than in theory. For starters, the first four provisions cited above are heavier on symbolism than practical impact. They involve things like pilot programs, advisory committees and optional extensions of definitions to include alternative-medicine practitioners. The research being conducted could ultimately make a difference, but it’s still a small portion of the institute’s portfolio. Most importantly, the most sweeping of the half dozen provisions -- the changes to reimbursement policy prompted by Section 2706 -- hasn’t yet turned into a boon for alternative-medicine practitioners. In states like California, Hawaii, Montana and Rhode Island, lawmakers have offered bills that would enshrine the language of Section 2706. But they have not become law yet. Meanwhile, the federal Department of Health and Human Services has thrown cold water on advocates’ most sweeping visions. Perhaps influenced by pushback from traditional medical disciplines, HHS issued guidance that says, in part, ""This provision (2706) does not require plans or issuers to accept all types of providers into a network."" Alyssa Wostrel, executive director of the Integrative Healthcare Policy Consortium, calls the HHS guidance ""faulty,"" and Harkin (who’s now retired from the Senate) and other advocates have sought to reverse it. But for now, the HHS guidance seems to be having a chilling effect on the expansion of alternative-medicine coverage. Our ruling Goldberg wrote that homeopathy, acupuncture and aromatherapy ""have been given elevated legitimacy under the Affordable Care Act."" The law does provide a leg up for alternative therapies (although it’s unclear whether homeopathy and aromatherapy would ultimately benefit). In practice, though, it’s important not to oversell the impact. Most of the provisions in question are modest, and the one with potentially the biggest impact has been curbed by a subsequent guidance from HHS. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B6E80>],/factchecks/2015/feb/24/jonah-goldberg/did-aca-give-elevated-legitimacy-alternative-medic/

High schoolers had to recite Islamic prayer in class, make prayer rugs as homework, websites say
","A spat between parents and administrators over a Seminole County high school history lesson in Islam has simmered into a minor cause célèbre for online critics. Ron Wagner of Longwood complained to a local TV station that his 15-year-old son was required to recite an Islamic prayer as part of a world history class at Lyman High School.  The students also had to make an Islamic prayer rug as a homework assignment, according to Wagner, who said lessons like that don’t belong in public schools. ""There’s a difference between teaching of the significance or the impact of a religion and teaching the specific tenets of the religion,"" Wagner told WFTV on Feb 9, 2015. Blogs and right-leaning media seized on the report, decrying the lessons as attempts to indoctrinate students. One blog, DownTrend.com, featured a post on Feb. 12 with the headline, ""Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs."" We don’t mean to pick on this one site -- because there are many, many other places that have reblogged the report -- and the writer did update the story after we asked him some questions. But the headline encapsulated the alleged events that have outraged so many people. Were students forced to recite an Islamic prayer and make prayer rugs at Lyman High School? PolitiFact Florida did our own homework. Taking notes Wagner met with Seminole County Public Schools administrators on Oct. 17, 2014, to discuss concerns about his son’s 10th grade world history class. Wagner alleged the class had been told to recite the first of the five pillars of Islam as printed in their textbook -- ""There is no god, but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God."" The prayer, known as the shahada, is an affirmation of faith among Muslims. Wagner also complained about 100 pages missing from his son’s history book and assignments to make Islamic prayer rugs and watch videos about Muslims. He said the teacher had contacted his son directly about the assignments via text messages, without his parents’ knowledge. Wagner’s wife, Lisa Huston, told PolitiFact Florida she and her husband believed the school district was favoring Islam, and that the missing pages were possibly removed deliberately. The textbook, published by Prentice Hall, has been singled out by some Florida and national groups for allegedly being pro-Islam, although it is approved by districts nationwide. District executive director of secondary education Michael Blasewitz conducted an investigation in October to determine if Wagner’s allegations were legitimate. Blasewitz concluded the teacher hadn’t violated any rules. Blasewitz repeated to PolitiFact Florida that the state has included Islam in its world history guidelines, and that Judaism and Christianity both are taught during the sixth grade, which the Florida Department of Education confirmed. You can read the entire district investigation report, but here are the highlights. Text messages: Wagner’s son had enrolled in Remind 101, in which students sign up for a third-party text messaging service for teachers to contact pupils about homework or class events. Blasewitz said parents were allowed to opt in. Missing textbook pages: The district found that 68 of the year-old textbooks lost pages from a binding error. Teachers had reported the problem, but Blasewitz said the school didn’t tell the district. Pearson, the publisher, replaced all the faulty copies, he said. (The missing chapters do include more information on Judaism and Christianity in the context of earlier civilizations.) Videos: The students watched short videos, including a TED Talk about stereotypes featuring an unidentified Iranian-American comedian. While the video did not violate guidelines, the district said a more straightforward selection should be made in future classes. Prayer rugs: Students were told to create prayer rugs, but the lesson was an assignment about Islamic art and not worship. The students were told they could incorporate any religious icons they wanted, as long as they observed Islamic artistic values, including no depictions of people or animals. The district said the assignment could be seen as controversial and recommended that a different art assignment ""would be more appropriate."" Prayer recitation: Blasewitz interviewed 10 students in the teacher’s two world history classes, and only one remembered the whole class being made to recite the prayer. Other students recalled following the book together in class, and the teacher gave extra credit to students who volunteered to read aloud. The teacher may have written the pillars of Islam on the board, they said, but did not make the students say any of them. Huston insisted to us that at least one other student in a different class period remembered an event similar to her son’s version of events, but Blasewitz said no other complaints had been filed. Our ruling DownTrend.com’s headline read, ""Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs."" This makes it sound as if students were being indoctrinated into a religion, and that's not the case. Instead, students were studying the religion of Islam as part of a world history class. According to a district investigation, pupils were assigned to make prayer rugs as an art assignment. The district recommended a different art assignment be made from now on. As for reciting the pillars of Islam in class, only one student complained his class was made to read the shahada. The investigation cited a notable lack of evidence that anyone was forced to recite a prayer. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E713C0>],/factchecks/2015/feb/24/blog-posting/high-schoolers-had-recite-islamic-prayer-class-mak/

Fact-checking John Legend's claim that 'we live in the most incarcerated country in the world'
","And the Oscar for Best Real Talk in an Acceptance Speech goes to — Actually, that’s a tough one. Some of Sunday’s Oscar winners issued sincere pleas for wage equality, suicide prevention and calling your parents, not to mention lingering racial injustice 50 years after the civil rights movement. Musicians John Legend and Common left the audience with a tear-inducing performance of their Oscar-winning Selma anthem ""Glory"" and then a powerful message about setbacks for black Americans in voting rights, police relations and imprisonment. ""We know that right now the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world,"" Legend said. ""There are more black men under correctional control today than there were under slavery in 1850."" As for Legend’s latter claim, it is true in terms of raw numbers. There are almost double the number of African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision as male slaves in 1850 — about 1.68 million prisoners compared to about 873,000 slaves. (The claim isn’t as solid if you adjust for the share of the black population.) PunditFact wanted to take a closer look at the first half of Legend’s first claim. Is the United States really the most incarcerated country in the world? The London-based International Centre for Prison Studies is the best resource for comparing worldwide prison statistics, experts said, pointing to the group’s World Prison Brief, which is updated monthly as data becomes available. The United States led the world in raw numbers, with 2.23 million prisoners at the end of 2012. More than half of those prisoners were held in state prisons, followed by people held at local jails, federal prisons, juvenile detention facilities, military and U.S. territorial prisons, immigration detention facilities, and Indian country jails, according to a breakdown of the center’s data performed by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population. Ranking just below the United States is China at 1.7 million, Russia at 671,700, Brazil at 581,500, and India at about 412,000. China’s population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid 2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.35 million in China, pushing it above the United States. But we can’t settle that possibility here. A better way to compare prison populations worldwide is to measure a country’s prison population as a share of the national population, experts told us. Adjusted for population, the United States’ prison population (707 prisoners per 100,000 population) exceeds countries around its size, including China. But according to the latest data, it ranks second -- not first -- worldwide. That distinction goes to the tiny nation of Seychelles, which posts the highest rate of 868 prisoners per 100,000 population based on the most recent data. Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, said he would not ding Legend  for not accounting for Seychelles. The countries are not at all in the same league. Seychelles is a group of African islands in the Indian Ocean northeast of Madagascar and is home to just over 90,000 people. For perspective, the least populous U.S. state is Wyoming with more than 580,000 residents. The addition of 240 Seychellois from 2012 to 2014 into an already small prison population dramatically pushes the rate from 707 prisoners per 100,000 population to 868, overtaking the United States. ""I think countries that small are just not comparable,"" Wagner said, adding that his group’s 2014 States of Incarceration report filtered out countries with less than a half-million residents. What sets American prisons apart from the rest of the world? ""We’ve criminalized so much behavior,"" said University of South Carolina criminology professor Geoff Alpert, singling out sentences for drug and property offenses in particular. Our ruling Legend said, ""We live in the most incarcerated country in the world."" The United States far and away incarcerates more people than its peers, in terms of the portion of its population behind bars, despite having a comparable amount of crime. Only Seychelles technically has a higher incarceration rate than the United States. But experts said it’s an outlier because of its miniscule size and largely should be disregarded. Maybe so, but it is a point at least worth noting. Legend’s Oscar-night claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966E7D40>],/factchecks/2015/feb/23/john-legend/fact-checking-john-legends-claim-we-live-most-inca/

Rudy Giuliani: Barack Obama said American exceptionalism no better than other countries'
","Okay, so maybe President Barack Obama does love America, Rudy Giuliani reluctantly admitted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. But the former New York City mayor qualified the concession with another knock on Obama: He doesn’t think America is better than everyone else. ""To say, as the president has, that American exceptionalism is no more exceptional than the exceptionalism of any other country in the world, does not suggest a becoming and endearing modesty, but rather a stark lack of moral clarity,"" Giuliani wrote Feb. 23. Giuliani penned the op-ed to defuse criticism that erupted last week after he told a crowd, ""I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America."" Already, Giuliani tried to cover his tracks by claiming Obama doesn’t say ""what an exceptional country we are"" (which was painstakingly debunked by the Washington Post Fact Checker). But does his new explanation hold up? We decided to take a look. Giuliani didn’t respond to our request for more information. But it’s pretty clear from his comments and other recent remarks that he’s talking about a press conference from the early days of Obama’s presidency. (Yes, this controversy over whether Obama supports the idea of ""American exceptionalism"" is now six years old.) While at an April 2009 NATO summit in France, a reporter from the London-based Financial Times asked Obama ""whether you subscribe, as many of your predecessors have, to the school of American exceptionalism that sees America as uniquely qualified to lead the world, or do you have a slightly different philosophy?"" Obama gave a nuanced answer that affirmed his belief in American exceptionalism and that ""America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity."" Obama also added, ""I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."" Admitting citizens of other countries believe that their countries are exceptional is not the same thing as saying all countries are equally exceptional, as Giuliani surmised. To put it in terms a New Yorker like Giuliani might understand: A Yankees fan who admits a Red Sox fan loves his team is not saying the Red Sox are as good as the Yankees. Obama went on to point out — on European soil no less — that America essentially saved Europe during and after World War II, and noted that the United States is ""the largest economy in the world,"" has ""unmatched military capacity,"" and possesses ""a core set of values that are enshrined in our constitution ... that, though imperfect, are exceptional."" Here’s Obama’s full response: I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism. I'm enormously proud of my country and its role and history in the world. If you think about the site of this summit and what it means, I don't think America should be embarrassed to see evidence of the sacrifices of our troops, the enormous amount of resources that were put into Europe postwar, and our leadership in crafting an Alliance that ultimately led to the unification of Europe. We should take great pride in that. And if you think of our current situation, the United States remains the largest economy in the world. We have unmatched military capability. And I think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality, that, though imperfect, are exceptional. Now, the fact that I am very proud of my country and I think that we've got a whole lot to offer the world does not lessen my interest in recognizing the value and wonderful qualities of other countries, or recognizing that we're not always going to be right, or that other people may have good ideas, or that in order for us to work collectively, all parties have to compromise and that includes us. And so I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships, because we create partnerships because we can't solve these problems alone. Our ruling Giuliani claimed that Obama said ""that American exceptionalism is no more exceptional than the exceptionalism of any other country."" In a response in which he repeatedly praised American exceptionalism and what it has offered the world, Obama also said, ""I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."" That is a pretty obvious and benign statement, and it’s hardly the same as Obama putting his opinion of American exceptionalism on the same level as Greek exceptionalism, as his full remarks show. We rate Giuliani’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809667CDC0>],/factchecks/2015/feb/23/rudy-giuliani/rudy-giuliani-barack-obama-said-american-exception/

On supporting 2015 right to work legislation, a Scott Walker reversal
","Gov. Scott Walker has gone from saying ""I'm not supporting"" so-called right to work legislation in Wisconsin's 2015 legislative session, to saying he will sign a bill that's being fast-tracked to his desk. Flip-flop? Let's turn to our Flip-O-Meter, which simply determines whether a politician's stance on an issue has changed. It does not test whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We’re not addressing Walker on right to work per se; he’s been a backer for more than two decades. Rather, we’re looking specifically at whether he has changed his position in terms of supporting a right to work law in Wisconsin in 2015. Right-to-work laws -- derided by some opponents as ""right to work for less"" laws -- are in place in 24 states. They prohibit businesses and unions from reaching labor deals that require workers to pay union fees. Generally speaking, we have found there is some evidence of economic advantage in right to work states. But evidence is lacking that right to work, rather than other factors, is the cause. (Go here to see a summary of our work on right to work.) Walker has been an advocate of right to work dating back to 1993, when he sponsored such legislation as a Wisconsin state lawmaker. But in recent months -- as he has transitioned from campaigning for re-election to pursuing a potential run for the White House – Walker has repeatedly called the issue a ""distraction,"" saying he has higher legislative priorities. Leadership committees in the Senate and Assembly voted Feb. 23, 2015 along party lines to open what is known as an extraordinary session, to take up only the labor legislation. Leaders expect it will be passed and sent to Walker within a week or so. Three points in time reveal a shift on Walker's part. Stating opposition  On May 11, 2012, Walker told reporters at the state Republican Party convention he had  ""no interest in pursuing right-to-work legislation in this state."" ""It’s not going to get to my desk,"" he said. ""I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure it isn’t there because my focal point (is) private sector unions have overwhelmingly come to the table to be my partner in economic development."" Walker would later renew that opposition with regard to 2015. Restating opposition for 2015 On Sept. 2, 2014, Walker -- in the midst of his campaign against Democrat Mary Burke to win re-election -- said he was not advocating for right to work. And he said he did not expect the Legislature to send such legislation his way in the session that would start in January 2015. ""I think it's pretty clear the Legislature has worked with us hand in hand in the past and I'm making it clear in this campaign, as I'll make it clear in the next (legislative) session, that that's not something that's part of my agenda,"" Walker said.

""My point is I'm not pushing for it. I'm not supporting it in this session.""

Walker declined to say whether he would veto the measure if it reached him. But that would change. Promises his signature On Feb. 20, 2015, Walker -- now a 2016 presidential hopeful riding a wave of momentum -- committed to signing the right to work bill being fast-tracked. ""I've never said that I didn't think it was a good idea,"" Walker told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""I've just questioned the timing in the past and whether it was right at that time."" But Walker had an opportunity to discourage GOP lawmakers from pursuing it, or to tell them he would not sign it if it reached his desk at this time. The Journal Sentinel reported that GOP Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said he brought up the right-to-work proposal as a possibility to the governor on Feb. 18, 2015. The next day he alerted Walker's chief of staff, Eric Schutt, to the plan to act on the bill quickly. And the day after that, Walker announced he would sign the bill.
  According to Fitzgerald, neither Walker nor Schutt discouraged him from putting the bill forward. Fitzgerald called Walker ""supportive"" but said ""he still probably believes there is a potential this could turn into something that would be disruptive."" Our rating Echoing comments he made in 2012, Walker stated in September 2014 that ""I'm not supporting"" right to work legislation in the 2015 legislative session. But on Feb. 20, 2015, with Republican lawmakers poised to send him such legislation, Walker said he would sign it. That is certainly a form of support. For a major reversal of position, we give Walker a Full Flop.

Yost says one-third of Millennials live with parents
","Del. Joseph Yost, 28, recently told the House of Delegates that his generation is ""ready for a serious conversation about the future of our state."" But before the dialogue can begin, the Montgomery County Republican told fellow lawmakers, ""you have to know what matters most to me and people of my age."" Yost spoke of two financial realities that have hurt his generation since the Great Recession: high college tuition and a tight job market. ""One-third of our age group have moved back in with their parents,"" Yost, R-Montgomery, said in a floor speech. No doubt, times have been tough. But we wondered whether so many of Yost’s age peers, after setting out on their own, have returned to their parents’ roosts. Yost, the youngest member of the General Assembly, told us he based his claim on an August 2013 report  by the Pew Research Center examining the living arrangements of Millennials -- defined by Pew as adults born after 1980. The report drilled into U.S. Census Bureau data on where people aged 18 through 31 lived in 2012. It found that 36 percent of them were living with their parents -- slightly higher than the one-third Yost proclaimed. Pew said the 36 percent living with parents was ""the highest share in at least four decades."" But aside from the uptick, figures in the report show the proportion of 18- to 31-year-olds living with their parents has been fairly stable over the last 50 years. In 1968, the first year for which figures are available, 32 percent of the age group lived with their parents. In 1981 it was 31 percent.  In 2007 -- on the cusp of the recession -- 32 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds lived with their parents. In other words, about one-third of 18- to 31-year-olds were living with their parents decades before the Great Recession. We should point out that Census data counts college students living in dormitories as residing with their parents. Richard Fry, a senior economist at Pew and author of the report, said some might quibble with categorizing those students as living with their parents. But Fry sees value in including them, saying those students -- who may head home for the summer -- still have ""a lot of financial ties to their parents."" Pew cited several reasons why the percentage of young adults living at home rose from a pre-recession level of 32 percent in 2007: Declining employment among young adults. An increase in unmarried Millennials who were more likely to live at home. In 1968, 56 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds were married, according to Pew. That fell to 23 percent in 2012. Rising college enrollment, with the students likely to be characterized as living at home. Fry has done an updated examination of the Census figures. They show that in 2014, about 32 percent of Millennials -- now age 18- to 33-years-old -- were living at home. A Gallup poll, released in February 2014 that found 29 percent of people age 18-34 were living with their parents. We should finally note that Yost says he permanently moved out of his parents’ home in 2006, when he graduated from Radford University.   Our ruling Yost says one-third of Millennials ""have moved back in with their parents."" He has the fraction right, but omits an important detail. This issue is not unique to Millennials. The proportion of 18- to 31-year-olds living with parents has been pretty steady over the years; it was 32 percent in 1968 and, after an increase in 2012, returned to 32 percent last year. It should also be made clear that Yost’s statistic refers to the percentage of Millennials living with their parents. Yost, in saying one-third ""have moved back in with their parents,"" suggests that one in three returned to the fold after trying to set out on their own. But some in this group -- the Pew study doesn’t say how many  -- never left home to begin with. Because it lacks context, we rate Yost’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E13B40>],/factchecks/2015/feb/23/joseph-yost/yost-says-one-third-millennials-live-parents/

NASA did not hire or employ theologians for research project
","NASA, aliens and 24 theologians — it sounds like the start of a joke, but in fact, it was the makings of misinformation spreading on social media. ""NASA hired 24 theologians to study human reaction to aliens,"" said the Dec. 28 post on Instagram. The post appeared to be a screenshot of an online story from the New York Post, and it was shared by Joe Rogan, host of the popular Spotify podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim stems from funding that NASA awarded to a nonprofit, but it gets the details wrong. The project happened several years ago, but the New York Post published an article Dec. 27 about a new book that describes the nonprofit’s work. NASA provided a grant in 2015 to the Center of Theological Inquiry, a nonprofit theological institute, to study astrobiology, which is research into the origins of life on Earth and the search for life beyond Earth. But those who worked on the project — including visiting scholars in theology, the humanities and social sciences — were not hired or employed by NASA. The project was called ""Inquiry on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology,"" and also received grant funding from the John Templeton Foundation. When the Center of Theological Inquiry was awarded the $1.1 million grant from NASA, the center’s director said the organization would ""oversee a resident team of visiting scholars in theology, the humanities, and social sciences that will conduct an interdisciplinary inquiry on the societal implications"" of the search for life in the universe, beyond Earth, according to a 2015 press release. NASA told fact-checkers that ""the researchers and scholars involved with this study were not hired by NASA, but instead received funding through CTI to conduct this work."" The agency also noted that the people receiving funding were not NASA employees or advisers. A NASA spokesperson told the Associated Press that NASA has sought to address similar topics, including the ""potential societal impact of finding life beyond Earth,"" since 1998. NASA’s astrobiology program ""supports research that leads to a better understanding of how life emerged and evolved on Earth, what conditions make environments in our universe capable of supporting life, and what the distribution of habitable worlds and life beyond Earth might be,"" according to its website. The Center of Theological Inquiry ""works on a distinctive model,"" according to a 2016 article in Religious Dispatches, a publication based at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. ""Each year, it invites a cohort of scholars to spend a year at the center, which is located in Princeton, N.J. While there, they pursue independent research projects and hold discussions around a common theme."" The Instagram post’s claim that the theologians involved in the project would study ""human reactions to aliens"" appears to be vastly oversimplified. The Religious Dispatches article said people were invited to apply for the astrobiology project if they were open to questions such as, ""If there are many different forms of life … how would philosophy relate these diverse forms life to one another and establish the limits of what it means to be ‘alive’?"" or ""How might the world’s religions respond to the discovery of life on other planets?"" An Instagram post said, ""NASA hired 24 theologians to study human reaction to aliens."" NASA awarded a grant in 2015 to the Center of Theological Inquiry to study astrobiology, and a description of the project involved philosophical questions about the prospect of alien life. But those involved in the project were not hired or employed by NASA. The claim contains an element of truth, but gives a misleading impression about NASA’s role. We rate this claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280966E7400>],/factchecks/2022/jan/18/instagram-posts/nasa-did-not-hire-or-employ-theologians-research-p/

Roger Williams is accurate that there were more COVID-19 deaths in 2021 than in 2020
","2021 was the year COVID-19 vaccines became widely available to Americans after a grim 2020. While our resistance to the virus has improved with the vaccine, the pandemic persists. On Dec. 2, U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, said in an email, ""According to the latest data from John (sic) Hopkins University, the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded so far in 2021 has surpassed the total for 2020."" He linked this increased level of deaths to President Joe Biden and credited the vaccine development to former President Donald Trump's Operation Warp Speed, a federal agency partnership to accelerate the development and distribution of the vaccine. We also found a Dec. 21 tweet by Williams that said, ""Americans are WORSE off under this Administration than ever before,"" citing ""More COVID deaths under President Biden than President Trump."" At the request of a reader, we're fact-checking this claim: Is it true that, despite vaccine availability, more people died from COVID-19 in 2021 than in 2020? We reached out to Williams' office (five emails starting Dec. 6 and three phone calls) to confirm the email and ask about the source but received no answer. However, the original Dec. 2 newsletter email pointed to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center's global map that tracks active cases, vaccines administered, and deaths worldwide. The dashboard has tracked how the world is faring against COVID-19 since the pandemic's early days. National outlets including USA Today, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Forbes all reported in late November that the number of deaths in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. They used Johns Hopkins data as an up-to-date marker of 2021 deaths and compared that to the CDC's official count of 2020 death certificates. The outlets used the dashboard data instead of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on COVID-19 deaths since CDC data is less frequently updated. Data must be received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics. CDC data indicates there were 385,443 U.S. deaths attributing COVID-19 as an underlying or contributing cause on death certificates in 2020. By contrast, there were 446,197 U.S. deaths attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates in 2021, as of Jan. 12. A CDC spokesperson wrote in a Jan. 5 email the CDC won't have the final 2021 data for nearly a year, but the death toll will climb as more data comes in for 2021. The spokesperson said it is safe to say the 2021 death toll will remain higher than in 2020. The CDC numbers show there were over 60,000 more deaths in 2021 compared to 2020. So, indeed, the number of COVID-19 deaths in 2021 as reported by the CDC exceeds the number of deaths reported in 2020. For Texas, the CDC counted 47,669 deaths involving COVID-19 in 2021 as of Jan. 12 and 33,542 deaths involving COVID-19 in 2020. Williams has voted against a mask mandate in the U.S. House and criticized Biden's vaccine mandate for employers, including in the same tweet he complained that Biden had presided over a higher COVID-19 death toll. The Biden administration has been advocating for vaccination as the linchpin in a strategy to combat the virus. Scientists call vaccination the single biggest protection against falling ill and dying from COVID-19. A September CDC report found that after the Delta variant became the most common variant, people who were not fully vaccinated had a 10-times-higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people. A study supported by the National Institutes of Health published in August estimated the vaccines prevented up to 140,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. during the first five months they were available. Spencer Fox, associate director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium,  said the first thing to consider when it comes to looking at 2020 and 2021 pandemic statistics is that 2020 is a ten-month period while 2021 is a full pandemic year. Much of the COVID-19 deaths happened March 2020 and onward; only 26 deaths involving COVID-19 were recorded for January and February 2020. Additionally, the U.S. experienced a surge in cases starting winter 2020 near the end of that year, Fox said. Many people died from those 2020 infections in early 2021, and that was well before vaccines were widely available. So while many of the infections in that wave happened in 2020, they were part of the 2021 mortality statistics. There was also a delta variant surge in summer 2021, after vaccines had become widely available to the public. ""What we've seen basically since that surge is really just continued spread,"" Fox said, noting that the delta and omicron variants surprised a lot of people. The delta variant was more infectious and had increased transmissibility, according to the CDC. ""But I think even though vaccines were widely available, I think a lot of the mortality that happened over the summer – during that major delta surge – was happening on unvaccinated individuals,"" Fox said. Fox noted that even though many people were vaccinated, vaccination rates were low. ""There was plenty kind of fuel for the COVID virus to spread on,"" Fox said. Timothy Bray, University of Texas at Dallas professor and director of the Institute for Urban Policy Research, noted there was not clear guidance at the beginning of the pandemic on how to record a death that was COVID-19-related. The institute runs the North Texas COVID Data Viewer and works with local governments on COVID-19 reporting. ""It didn't even have a cause of death code. And so, in the early days, we were asking local health departments to tell us how many people have you had that have died from COVID,"" Bray said. ""Eventually, that process became a little bit more concretized and was hung upon the death certificate process."" Detecting and determining COVID-19 deaths has been an evolving process, Bray said, adding that numbers have become more accurate as officials got better at detecting the virus and knowing its complications. So while there have been more COVID-19 deaths counted in 2021, it's also important to note that individual medical professionals and local hospitals have gotten better at tracking deaths. And all that data on the local level rolls up to become the national-level data. ""Over time, the medical community's understanding of the disease, and the complications of the disease, has changed,"" Bray said. Williams' office wrote in a Dec. 2 email newsletter,  ""According to the latest data from John (sic) Hopkins University, the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded so far in 2021 has surpassed the total for 2020."" CDC data shows there were over 60,000 more deaths in 2021 compared to 2020. Johns Hopkins data, used by Williams and many national news outlets, also reported more deaths in 2021.

In Australia, the vaccination status of hospitalized COVID-19 patients doesn’t tell the whole story
","Australia faces a surge of COVID-19 cases as the highly contagious omicron COVID-19 variant continues to spread across the continent.  Throughout the pandemic, each spike in cases has taken its toll on hospital systems, and the omicron surge has been no different.  But one media outlet claims there is something different about the latest wave of COVID-19. ""Fully Vaccinated Australians In Hospital For COVID-19 Surpass Unvaccinated,"" reads the headline of a Jan. 12 article from the Epoch Times, a conservative media site with a history of publishing misinformation. Similar to the headline, the beginning of the article implies that the vaccinated are more susceptible during the omicron surge. ""For the first time, New South Wales (NSW) has seen more fully vaccinated patients hospitalised with COVID-19 compared to the number of unvaccinated patients as the Omicron outbreak continues to edge toward its peak,"" the article says. Beyond that sentence, the article is behind a paywall — keeping many readers from seeing context that explains the situation more fully. The article was shared in social media posts, which were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline is misleading; it refers to ""Australians,"" but the complete article focuses only on data from New South Wales, a state in the southeast region of the country. The data from the New South Wales government was current through Jan. 9.  According to that data, 2,030 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in New South Wales. Of those patients, 28.8% were unvaccinated and 68.9% were fully vaccinated. (The data does not include information about whether the patients had received vaccine boosters.) The same data reported 159 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units. Of those patients, 49.1% were unvaccinated and 50.3% were vaccinated. Based on those New South Wales statistics, it was accurate to say that the number of vaccinated people in hospitals in New South Wales exceeded the number of unvaccinated people. Even so, the Epoch Times article itself acknowledged the apparent increased risk for the unvaccinated.  ""Based on the data presented, unvaccinated individuals appear to be six times more likely to be hospitalised and nearly 13 times more likely to be sent to ICU than those who are fully vaccinated,"" said the Epoch Times. ""This is considering that the number of unvaccinated patients appears to be over-represented in the figures — 7.3 percent of the NSW population aged 12 and over at the time were unvaccinated, but they made up half of the COVID-19 ICU patients in the NSW Health system."" The article no longer references the most current data. Currently, there are more people hospitalized in New South Wales and Victoria — Australia’s hardest-hit states — than at any earlier point of the pandemic, Reuters reported. On Jan. 12, New South Wales officials reported 2,242 COVID-19 patients in hospitals throughout the state. Premier Dominic Perrottet reported 175 patients in ICUs.  ""More than 50% of those people are unvaccinated,"" Perrottet said of the ICU patients. ""Vaccination has been key over this period of time in keeping you and your friends and your family safe. It is very clear on those numbers. They do not lie."" In New South Wales, 92.5% of the eligible population (those age 12 and older) were fully vaccinated as of Jan. 9, according to the state’s most recent COVID-19 data. That represents 78.3% of the state’s total population.  Perrottet emphasized that because New South Wales has such high vaccination rates, the fact that more than 50% of those in the ICU with COVID-19 were unvaccinated demonstrates the effectiveness of the vaccines. ""Around 93% of adults in NSW have now been fully vaccinated, leaving around 7% of the population not entirely protected,"" the New Zealand Herald reported on Jan. 12. ""Despite making up a small proportion of the wider community, these 7% now account for more than half of all ICU admissions.""  Catherine Bennett, an epidemiology professor at Deakin University, told the Herald that if the vaccines weren’t protecting people from severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization, vaccinated people would make up a larger portion of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units.  ""People making up a very small proportion of the at-risk population, are making up a large proportion of those in ICU,"" Bennett said. An Epoch Times headline shared on social media said ""Fully vaccinated Australians in hospital for COVID-19 surpass unvaccinated.""  The headline suggests that vaccinated people are more susceptible to severe illness from the virus than unvaccinated people. But the headline misrepresents the data cited in the article, parts of which are accessible only to paying subscribers. The article is about data from one Australian state — not the whole country — where there were more vaccinated people in the hospital than unvaccinated people.  But nearly 93% of eligible people in the state are vaccinated. Coupled with the fact that more than 50% of those in the ICU with COVID-19 were unvaccinated, experts say, the figures demonstrate the vaccines’ effectiveness in preventing severe illness. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"['Economy', 'Virginia', 'Ralph Northam']","
Northam's economic development claim largely holds up
","In the final days of his term, Gov. Ralph Northam has been stressing that his governorship was about more than coronavirus and racial justice issues that led the news. ""During our four years, we’ve brought in more than $81 billion in economic investment, more than four times any previous administration…"" Northam said Wednesday during his valedictory State of the Commonwealth address.  Northam made the same claim in a Dec. 16, 2021 speech to the General Assembly’s money committees and in a Jan. 9 op-ed in The Virginian-Pilot.  He will leave office on Jan. 15. Northam’s press secretary, Alena Yarmosky, told us the governor’s claim is based on records kept by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, a state authority that promotes business location and expansion. The records identify each economic development project announced by recent governors, the expected investment by the company and the expected number of new jobs the project will bring to Virginia.  The data tells us that Northam-announced projects are, in total, expected to bring more than four times as much corporate investment to Virginia than those of his six most recent predecessors. Here are the numbers: Northam, $81.4 billion; Terry McAuliffe, $18.7 billion; Bob McDonnell, $13.7 billion; Tim Kaine, $11.8 billion; Mark Warner, $13 billion; Jim Gilmore, $12.3 billion; George Allen, $10.7 billion. Although Northam can claim success in economic development, there are caveats to these numbers. First, these totals represent only deals that governors publicly announced, which are different from ironclad contracts. Some of the announced deals never come into fruition, others never meet expectations and some exceed them. It’s too early to tell how many of Northam’s projects will succeed. For example, the largest project announced by McAuliffe never materialized: a deal with  Tranlin Inc., a Chinese company that promised to build a $2 billion paper plant in Chesterfield County and bring 2,000 jobs to the Richmond area. Although the deal failed, the numbers are still counted in VEDP’s tally of deals announced by McAuliffe, who led the state from 2014 to 2018. ""If we’re saying all $80 billion of investment (under Northam) is going to occur, that’s probably not going to happen,"" said Robert McNab, director of the Dragas Center for Economic Analysis and Policy at Old Dominion University. Another issue: Some deals take years to work out, and the governor who began negotiations with a company may not be the one who announces an agreement. For example, one of the richest deals Northam announced was Amazon’s $2.5 billion plan to build a corporate headquarters in Arlington that will bring an estimated 25,000 new jobs to the region. Although VEDP credits the numbers to Northam, who played a large role in making the deal, the state’s highly competitive recruitment of Amazon began under McAuliffe. ""There’s some luck of timing involved,"" said Terry Rephann, a regional economist for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia who is skeptical about the value of the announcement data. Governor’s ""love to toot their horns on the announcements,"" he said. A more meaningful measure of economic growth, Rephann said, is to look at the number of jobs the projects create. The VEDP lists the estimated new jobs that come with each announcement, but they come with the same caveats we have discussed. Northam ranks third among his six predecessors in this category.  Here are the total job estimates that came with the projects each governor announced: Gilmore, 159,770; Warner, 122,883; Northam, 103,568 Allen, 89,650 McAuliffe, 77,377; McDonnell, 75,563; Kaine, 74,444. McNab said Northam deserves credit for economic expansion and that the state has become increasingly wise in targeting new businesses and creative in offering incentives for them to move to Virginia. Under Northam, there was a notable increase in construction and expansion of data centers, huge facilities that centralize an organization’s information technology operations. Data centers don’t require many employees, but they pay sizable local real estate taxes. They also bring spin-off companies that help service and replace equipment. Of the 894 economic development projects announced during Northam’s term, 673 publicized expansion plans by existing companies in Virginia and 221 heralded new companies moving into the state. In estimated investment under Northam, $69.4 billion comes from the expansion of companies already in Virginia and $12 billion comes from new ones locating in the state.  Our ruling Northam said, ""We’ve brought in more than $81 billion in economic investment, more than four times any previous administration."" Northam accurately cites figures compiled by the state’s economic development authority. The numbers reflect the total estimated investment of businesses that each of the last seven governors announced were moving to Virginia or expanding their existing facilities in the state. While the numbers indicate strong economic development during Northam’s term, they come with caveats. Some of the projects governors announce never get off the ground, and others fail to meet expectations. So the actual investment under Northam is likely to shrink from its announced total. Also, many projects transcend gubernatorial terms. A governor who started negotiations with a company may not be the one who announces a deal. We rate Northam’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097482F80>],/factchecks/2022/jan/14/ralph-northam/northams-economic-development-claim-largely-holds/

The false claim that 100,000 Wisconsin voters registered more than 100 years ago
","A video on Facebook suggests that the Wisconsin voter rolls are padded with tens of thousands of voters who registered to vote more than a century ago. ""The Wisconsin voter roll has over 120,000 active voters who have been registered to vote for over 100 years,"" said the speaker in a Facebook video shared Jan. 7. ""The margin of victory is 20,000. Yes that’s right: Biden beat Trump by 21,000 votes yet there are over 120,000 people in Wisconsin who are more than 100 years old and they are voters."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video comes from Ivory Hecker, a Fox 26 Houston general assignment reporter who was fired in 2021 after she accused Fox Corp of ""muzzling"" her live on air and said she made recordings of her bosses and gave them to Project Veritas, an organization known for undercover reporting using hidden cameras and selectively edited recordings. Hecker told us she is now an independent journalist. Ivory’s video clip doesn’t flat out say that these improbably old voters are a sign of fraud, but it implies that there is something suspicious about the battleground state’s voter rolls. Democrat Joe Biden did beat Republican incumbent Donald Trump for president in Wisconsin by roughly 21,000 votes.  Hecker’s video ignores the explanation by the Wisconsin Elections Commission about why there are so many voters with dates of birth of 1900 and registration years of 1918 in their registration system. The short answer is that the old dates come from merging municipal records statewide more than a decade ago, and the 1900 and 1918 were used as default dates if the records lacked a date of birth or registration date. Since 2020, one of the common falsehoods spread on social media or by political figures is that the voter rolls are filled with dead people, or people well above 100 years old. We debunked claims about dead people on the voter rolls in Virginia, Nevada, Wisconsin and Detroit, Michigan.The falsehoods generally stem from either administrative errors or a misunderstanding about the administration of election records. Hecker’s video is a teaser to her full show on YouTube in which she explained that she heard the claim about the 120,000 voters from Christina Bobb, a reporter for OAN, a rightwing media outlet. Bobb drew her information from a Dec. 8 hearing by a Wisconsin Assembly committee hearing where a supposed software expert, Jeff O’Donnell, testified about the voters whose records showed they had  been registered for more than 100 years. But he acknowledged that the registration date of 1918 was ""perhaps a placeholder."" The next day, Trump’s Save America PAC highlighted coverage of the hearing by the right-wing Gateway Pundit. Prior to 2005, voter registration in municipalities with less than 5,000 individuals was not required in Wisconsin. In more populous municipalities, election officials tracked their own voter registration information through various databases and spreadsheets.  The Help America Vote Act of 2002 required the state to maintain a database of all voters, a project which was implemented a few years later.  When a municipality’s system didn’t track a voter’s date of birth or initial date of registration,  a default date was entered into the statewide system: 1/1/1900 for date of birth and 1/1/1918 for date of registration. ""Default dates of birth and voter registration dates in the WisVote database is not a newly discovered issue or an indication of voter fraud,"" the state wrote in 2020. The older dates are a result of the state migrating over hundreds of municipal records into a state system. Since 2006, many of these default dates have gone away, as voters move or update their names. The voter’s former record with the default dates would then be merged with the new record with updated information. As of the fall of 2021, there were still about 3,700 active voter records that contain default information for date of birth and about 120,000 records exist in the system with a default date of voter registration.  The practice of using a default date in a registration database when a voter’s record lacks the information has also been used in Ohio and North Carolina.  Hecker told PolitiFact in an email that ""I never called this issue fraud. Voter roll anomalies often appear to be due to laziness — lack of voter roll maintenance. Lack of maintenance can open the door for fraud. That's why this matters."" We sent Hecker a link from the Wisconsin Elections Commission that showed their explanation of the 1900 and 1918 dates. ""This lack of accurate and up-to-date information is indeed a problem and an anomaly,"" Hecker replied. Hecker’s video clip said ""the Wisconsin voter roll has over 120,000 active voters who have been registered to vote for over 100 years."" This is inaccurate. There are about 120,000 records in Wisconsin’s voter database that show a default registration date of 1/1/1918, but this is not representative of voters who have been registered for 100 years. Rather, it’s the result of a data migration workaround that came about 16 years ago when Wisconsin merged its statewide database with municipal databases.

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson flips position on seeking a third term
","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, has long been considered the GOP’s best chance to hold onto the seat in 2022. Democrats, meanwhile, have made the seat a top target. Whichever side wins, the race will play a key role in control of a chamber now divided 50-50. But there is one unexpected candidate – Johnson himself. In 2016, when Johnson won a second term, he told voters he would not seek a third term. But on Jan. 9, 2022, there was Johnson announcing he would run again. Yes, that means it’s time for the Flip-O-Meter and our requisite reminder: It measures whether a person has been consistent on an issue, not whether any change makes for good (or bad) politics or policy. On this one, let’s just say sometimes, politicians make our job very easy. In October 2016, in the run-up to the election, Johnson first mentioned he planned not to run for a third term in an interview with the Baraboo News Republic. At the time, he was facing former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat who had served 18 years in the Senate, in what was a rematch of the 2010 election – and this time Johnson was trailing in the polls. Ultimately, as former President Donald Trump, a Republican, won Wisconsin, Johnson won with 50.2% of the vote to Feingold’s 46.8%. A little more than two years after his win, in November 2018, Democrats took over the U.S. House and Republicans lost every statewide race. Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he still did not plan to run again, and wanted to focus on his work in the Senate But he had started to waver. ""That's always been my game plan,"" he said of not seeking a third term. ""I will say I never expected this to happen, though. The reality has changed from what I thought it would be in 2022."" In early March 2021, following the state swinging blue in the 2020 presidential election, Johnson noted another race was not out of the realm of possibility. During a media call, Johnson said that it was ""probably my preference now"" not to seek re-election, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. But he said he had never anticipated Democrats would have full control of Congress and there would be a Democratic president in the White House. In the months since, there has been similar hemming and hawing. Finally, he announced his re-election bid in a Jan. 9, 2022 opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal, citing the ""the Democrats' complete takeover of government and the disastrous policies they have inflicted on America and the world, to say nothing of those they threaten to enact in the future."" He told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel it was not an easy decision. ""It is not a decision I have made lightly,"" he said.

Evidence scant that Joe Biden was arrested protesting for civil rights
","When President Joe Biden went to Georgia to press for voting rights legislation, he made a passing reference to a moment from his past — the time he ""got arrested"" while protesting for civil rights. It’s not the first time Biden has said he was arrested in his youth while protesting for civil rights. And it’s not the first time that the evidence to back up his assertion is scarce. He’s been called out repeatedly for decades by fact-checkers, including PolitiFact, for exaggerating his experiences with the civil rights movement and his interactions with law enforcement. Biden invoked the civil rights battles of the 1960s as he spoke on a campus shared by Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University, two historically black colleges. ""I did not walk in the shoes of generations of students who walked these grounds,"" he said. ""But I walked other grounds. Because I’m so damn old, I was there as well."" This drew laughs from the crowd. ""You think I’m kidding, man. It seems like yesterday the first time I got arrested. Anyway."" We reached out to the White House to clarify what arrest he was referring to, and they pointed to excerpts from three speeches Biden has made in recent years. They addressed an incident in Delaware in the 1950s in which people gathered to protest the sale of a home to a Black couple. Police were called to the home as hundreds of people protested outside. There were a few arrests, but no evidence that Biden was among them.  In the earliest of those speeches, at the Economic Club of Southwest Michigan on Oct. 16, 2018, Biden discussed the episode in the context of joining the ticket of Barack Obama, who would become the first Black president. Biden recalled the 2008 exchange with his mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, who was then in her 90s: ""She said, ‘Joey, didn't I call you about a month ago and ask you about Barack?’ I said, ‘Yeah, mom.’ She said, ‘Didn't you say to me you thought he was really bright and had a great deal of integrity and would make a good president if he was the nominee?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ ""She said, ‘Joey, remember at 15 years old and that real estate agent sold a house to the Black couple in Lynnfield.’ … This was in suburban sprawl, the neighboring neighborhood. ‘I told you not to go down there because of the protests, and you went down and you got arrested because you were standing on the porch with the Black couple?’ I said, ‘Yeah, mom. I remember that.’"" Biden again used the word ""arrested"" when describing what his mother said about thday in another speech at an African Methodist Episcopal Church in Nevada on Feb. 16, 2020. But Biden has not always used the term ""arrest"" when telling this story. On Dec. 13, 2018, during remarks at the University of Utah, he recounted his mother saying, ""Remember I told you not to go down, and the police brought you back because you were standing on the front porch with the Black couple?"" He used similar language in quoting his mother — the police ""brought you home,"" rather than ""arrested"" him — during a Zoom interview with Oprah Winfrey on Oct. 28, 2020, the Washington Post Fact Checker reported.  Biden did not mention getting arrested when he recalled the discussions around joining the ticket with Obama in his 2017 memoir, ""Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose."" Contemporary newspaper articles confirm that there were protests at two homes near where Biden was growing up in Delaware in 1959. The larger one in Collins Park was at the home of a Black couple. The second, in suburban Carrcroft, was held at the home of the real estate broker who had sold that couple their home. The News-Journal, a Wilmington newspaper, reported on Feb. 25, 1959, that seven arrests followed the protest at the Collins Park home — three men for disturbing the peace and four teenagers for possessing fireworks. An Associated Press article on March 2, 1959, said that a 17-year-old — described as the son of a ""Harold Figgett"" — arrested for juvenile delinquency was among four people arrested that Saturday. (Biden would have been 16 at the time.) It also mentions the seven earlier arrests. No arrests were made at the Carrcroft home protest, the AP reported. So there’s evidence that protests over racial discrimination in housing occurred in the general proximity of Biden’s home when he was a teenager. Biden’s home in Lynnfield was about 9 miles from the Collins Park home and a short walk away from the Carrcroft home, according to Google Maps.  There is no record of Biden being arrested. Ric Simmons, an Ohio State University law professor, said that if the police arrived to break up a disturbance, told everyone to disperse, offered to drive some of the people home, and Biden agreed to be driven home, then the ride would have been consensual and thus definitively not an arrest. If the officer instead made clear to Biden that he did not have a choice and would be forcibly placed into the squad car if he refused, then Biden would have been ""seized."" Not all seizures are arrests, Simmons said, but the argument for calling it an arrest would be stronger. However, Simmons added that this is a hyper-legal definition of arrest. It would be ""very unlikely,"" he said, that an ordinary person would consider being driven home by the police in this scenario — without a booking at the police station or any involvement with the courts — to be an ""arrest."" ""If anything, Biden's experience seems like the police officer made a conscious decision not to arrest — whether because Biden was a juvenile, or because the officer was sympathetic to Biden's motivation, or because Biden's actions did not constitute probable cause to believe a crime occured,"" Simmons said. ""So I think to call this an ‘arrest’ in the lay sense of the term is an exaggeration, to say the least. It would be more accurate to say he had a run-in with police, or that he was involved in an event in which the police had to intervene."" Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, in Minnesota, added that how Biden perceived the events might be quite different from how outsiders would perceive them. ""While being driven home by the police probably isn’t viewed as an arrest by the police, it may feel that way to a young person,"" Osler said. This is not the first time Biden has been challenged over whether he has been arrested in events surrounding civil rights.  At a campaign event in 2020, he said he had been arrested in South Africa in 1977 while attempting to see the then-imprisoned Black leader Nelson Mandela. PolitiFact rated this Pants on Fire. After multiple outlets fact-checked this claim, Biden clarified that he had been separated at the airport from a Black delegation he was traveling with. Biden has also been accused of embellishing his activism in the 1960s. During his 1988 campaign for president, Biden told crowds that he marched in the civil rights movement. Even though his advisers, according to the New York Times, ""gently reminded"" him that he hadn’t, Biden continued to make the claim. Then, during his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden told viewers of a virtual town hall with the NAACP that he ""got involved in the civil rights movement. Desegregating restaurants, that kind of thing."" The Washington Post’s Fact-Checker gave that claim Two Pinocchios, writing that ""as far as we can determine, Biden participated in just one walk-out at one restaurant."" Biden has twice made claims of being arrested for less serious reasons — once when he accompanied two women to their Ohio University dorm in 1963, and another time when he said he wandered onto the floor of the U.S. Senate as a 21-year-old. In both cases, he revised the story. Biden said that as a youth, ""I got arrested"" protesting for civil rights.  Biden may have participated in one of two flare-ups over racial discrimination in housing that occurred near his home in Delaware when he was in a teenager. However, there is no evidence that Biden was actually arrested in the sense of being booked at a police station and facing any consequences in the criminal justice system. At times, Biden himself has described the police’s actions as driving him home, rather than putting him under arrest. We rate the statement False.  Caryn Baird contributed to this article.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972E37C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/13/joe-biden/evidence-scant-joe-biden-was-arrested-protesting-c/

Former Presidents and members of Congress don’t get salaries ‘for life’
","Elected officials’ post-retirement benefits have long been the target of false or misleading claims. PolitiFact has repeatedly debunked claims about benefits available to executive and legislative officials when they’re finished serving.  An old post with more such claims is regaining traction on Facebook.  ""Salary of retired U.S. presidents … $450,000 FOR LIFE,"" the image in the post reads.  Originally published in 2019, the post goes on to quote other salaries ""for life"" for lawmakers: $174,000 for House and Senate members; $223,500 for the speaker of the House; and $194,400 for other congressional leaders.  It continues with a comparison: ""Average salary of a soldier DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN … $38,000,"" the image reads. ""Average income for seniors on Social Security … $12,000. I think we found where the cuts should be made!""  The post, which people were sharing and commenting on as recently as Jan. 13, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post quotes numbers that align with the current salaries of officials in office. But it makes a big error by attaching the phrase ""for life."" Elected officials at the federal level can qualify for pensions after they leave office, but they’re not entitled to their full salaries for life.  What do the benefits actually look like for former presidents and members of Congress? Here’s what we found:  The president earns $400,000 a year while in office, plus a $50,000 expense allowance. The Former Presidents Act of 1958 established that former presidents are entitled annually to an amount ""equal to the annual rate of basic pay, as in effect from time to time, of the head of an executive department"" — that is, the base pay of a cabinet secretary, not their presidential salary.   Today, that amount is ​​$226,300, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Former presidents are also given allowances for office space and staff and for security and travel expenses.  The total benefits may be worth more than the ""$450,000 for life"" that the post claims, but the annual pension for ex-presidents is $226,300. A 2018 Congressional Research Service report responding to persistent misinformation spelled out the rules on lawmakers’ pay and benefits.  ""Members of Congress receive salaries only during the terms for which they are elected,"" the report said. ""They do not receive salaries beyond their terms of office."" Congressional salaries haven't changed since 2009. In 2022, most senators and representatives collect an annual salary of $174,000. The speaker of the House gets paid $223,500, and the Senate president pro tempore and the majority and minority leaders of the two chambers earn $193,400 each year​​ while they’re in office.  Representatives and senators become eligible to receive retirement benefits only after serving in Congress for at least five years. That’s nearly one full term for a senator, or more than two terms for a House member. Those who have completed the minimum service could begin collecting their pensions at age 62, according to the Congressional Research Service report. Those with a longer record of service can start collecting sooner. ""The amount of the pension depends on length of service, as measured in months, and the average of the highest three years of salary,"" the report explained. But the benefits cannot exceed 80% of that person’s final salary. Based on the current salaries, the annual pension would be capped at $178,800 for a retiring House speaker, and for $139,200 for rank-and-file members. On average, they receive less than that. As of Oct. 1, 2018, 617 retired members of Congress were receiving pensions ""based fully or in part on their congressional service,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. About half of them retired under the Civil Service Retirement System, which existed before 1984, and were receiving an average annual pension of $75,528. The others retired under the ​​Federal Employees’ Retirement System and were receiving an average annual pension of $41,208. The salary for active-duty military members varies based on rank, experience and other factors, so it is unclear exactly how the post arrived at the $38,000 ""average.""  A private with less than two years of experience makes $21,420 in basic pay, while a sergeant with six years of experience makes about $38,246, according to the U.S. Army. Basic pay does not include ""bonuses, allowances and other benefits."" The average monthly benefit paid to retired workers relying on Social Security income is $1,555, according to the Social Security Administration. That amounts to a yearly income of about $18,660 — or 55% more than the Facebook post claims.  A viral image shared on Facebook claimed that former presidents and members of Congress collect salaries ""for life."" Former members of Congress do not receive full congressional salaries for life. After serving five years in Congress, former members become eligible to collect a pension. The amount of the pension varies based on length of service, but it would be less than their salary when they were in office.  Presidents earn $400,000 a year when they’re in office, not for life. Former presidents are entitled to a pension equivalent to the salary of a cabinet secretary; the current rate is $226,300 a year.

Biden's statement on Trump's 2020 mail voting is Half True
","While Republican state lawmakers have passed and proposed numerous restrictions on voting  by mail since the 2020 election, there exists a curious fact: The leader of their party, former President Donald Trump, chose to vote by mail multiple times in recent years. President Joe Biden noted that do-what-I say-not-what-I-do philosophy during a speech in Georgia calling on Congress to pass voting rights legislation. Biden said that Georgia Republicans have put up obstacles such as ""making it harder for you to vote by mail,"" a reference to the state law passed in 2021 that adds some restrictions to voting by mail, including availability of drop boxes. But in the presidential election, Trump himself cast a mail ballot, Biden said. ""The same way, I might add, in the 2020 election, President Trump voted from behind the desk in the White House in Florida,"" Biden said.  Biden is partially correct about Trump’s 2020 voting habits: Trump cast a mail ballot twice in 2020 primary elections. (We don’t know where Trump physically sat to fill out his mail ballot.) But in October 2020, after he was repeatedly challenged about why he criticized voting by mail while using it himself, Trump voted early in person for the general election.  Before and after the 2020 general election, Trump spread many falsehoods about voting by mail. These falsehoods have helped fuel the push by many state GOP lawmakers to craft bills that add restrictions to voting by mail in several states, including Georgia and Florida. Biden has called on Congress to pass two key pieces of voting rights legislation: the Freedom to Vote Act, which would create uniform standards for voting including casting mail ballots, and a bill named after U.S. Rep. John Lewis that aims to block discriminatory voting laws. Trump became a Florida registered voter in 2019 using his Mar-a-Lago address. In 2020, we interviewed Wendy Sartory Link, the Palm Beach County supervisor of elections, about Trump’s voting record. A representative picked up ballots for Trump from the elections office, which is allowed under Florida law. Link confirmed that Trump voted using that method for the presidential preference primary in March and the state primary in August. The elections office doesn’t record for each individual whether their ballot is physically dropped off, mailed in or put in a drop box. Trump chose to vote by mail rather than in person even though his motorcade repeatedly drove right by an early voting site at a Palm Beach County library around the date of the March 2020 election, CNN reported. In 2020, Trump and his allies encouraged their supporters to cast ballots by mail, while attacking the option in court and in public.  ​​For the general presidential election, Trump voted early in person at the Palm Beach County Main Library, Saturday, Oct. 24, 2020, in West Palm Beach, Florida.  ""I voted for a guy named Trump,"" the president said, according to a pool report, the New York Times wrote. Trump said that his experience had been ""perfect"" and that ""it was a very secure vote."" In the summer of 2020, Trump defended his record of voting by mail. ""I’m an absentee voter because I can’t be in Florida, because I’m in Washington,"" Trump said in July 2020 before repeating unsubstantiated claims of fraud. ""I’m at the White House, so I’ll be an absentee voter. We have a lot of absentee voters, and it works. We’re in favor of absentee, but it’s much different than millions of people in California. They’re going to send out tens of millions of voting forms. Well, where are they going to go? You read where postmen are in big trouble now. You read where city councils are in big trouble now. Voter fraud all over the ballot."" The Florida Legislature unanimously voted in 2016 to change the phrase ""absentee"" to ""vote-by-mail,"" in order to ease confusion among voters who mistakenly believed that they had to be away from home to request a ballot by mail. That meant that under Florida law it didn’t matter whether Trump was at the White House, Florida or anywhere else in the world when it was voting season — he had a legal right to a mail ballot. Biden singled out Trump’s voting history in 2020, but we decided to look back at his voting habits back to the 2016 general election. We contacted a spokesperson for the New York City Board of Elections to ask questions about Trump’s voting history, but did not hear back by deadline. However, we found news reports showing that sometimes as a New York voter, Trump cast an absentee ballot. 2018: In the midterm elections, Trump voted absentee, a White House spokesperson told reporters. Many high ranking officials in the Trump administration or the campaign voted by mail in 2018 or in recent years prior, including Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Bill Barr, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the Washington Post. 2017: The New York Daily News reported that Trump filled out an absentee ballot for the mayoral election and checked a box on an application stating he would be absent from the city on Election Day. The newspaper found that Trump’s ballot application listed his birthday as July but it is actually June 14, 1946. NY1 reported that Trump and his wife Melania authorized a campaign staffer to pick up the ballots for them. 2016: Trump voted in person in the November election at Manhattan’s Public School 59, blocks from Trump Tower, where he lived. We didn’t look further back for news reports about whether Trump voted absentee or in person prior to November 2016. However, his efforts to cast a ballot in 2004 drew attention in 2020 when a 2004 ""Access Hollywood"" video resurfaced. ""Access Hollywood"" filmed Trump as he attempted to vote in person in New York City, where he was turned away from various sites because poll workers said he wasn’t registered to vote at those locations. In the video, Trump grew frustrated and said, ""I'm going to fill out the absentee ballot."" Ultimately, Trump was seen filling out a ballot in the backseat of a car.  ""At least you can say the Trumpster doesn’t give up,"" Trump says. ""You’ve gotta vote."" ""Access Hollywood"" reported that Trump cast a provisional ballot. Biden said, ""In the 2020 election, President Trump voted from behind the desk in the White House in Florida.""  We don’t know where Trump sat when he voted in 2020, but we do know from Palm Beach County election officials that he voted via a mail ballot in the presidential preference primary in March and the August primary. A representative picked up the ballot for him, which is uncommon but allowed. That said, when people hear ""the 2020 election"" they generally think of the general election. And for that, Trump cast his ballot in person at an early voting site at a library.

Social media claims distort CDC director’s comment about COVID-19 deaths and comorbidities
","Dr. Rochelle Walensky, one of the nation’s top public-health officials, shared encouraging news in a TV interview about the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing COVID-19 deaths. But social media posts and articles seized on an edited clip of the interview to falsely suggest that she was downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19.  ""The CDC director just said over 75% of ‘covid deaths’ occurred in people with at least four comorbidities,"" reads a Facebook post from Freedom Works, a conservative and libertarian advocacy group based in Washington. ""Since Biden can’t shut down covid, suddenly all this data is getting shared publicly."" Conservative news websites the Western Journal and Town Hall chimed in, calling it a ""shocking"" and ""damning"" admission. Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s son, also weighed in on Twitter: 75% of “Covid Deaths” were in people with at least 4 comorbidities according to the CDC. That’s it. That’s the tweet. Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was referring to a new CDC study that found over 75% of deaths among vaccinated individuals involved people who had at least four comorbidities, such as another disease, risk factor or health condition. The statistic bolsters the argument that vaccines are effective against COVID-19. The social media claims didn’t mention that the study was on vaccinated people, which gave the misleading impression that Walensky was saying that overall deaths attributed to COVID-19 were largely due to other conditions. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The confusion began when ABC News initially released a shortened version of Walensky’s Jan. 7 interview. This version, which quickly spread online, showed Walensky responding to a question from White House correspondent Cecilia Vega about how the study seemed to show vaccines working to prevent severe illness.  ""The overwhelming number of deaths, over 75%, occurred in people who had at least four comorbidities,"" Walensky said. ""So really, these are people who were unwell to begin with."" The clip does include Vega mentioning encouraging news about vaccine effectiveness, but the edit cuts off the beginning of Walensky’s response, which makes clear that she was referring to a study of vaccinated people. Here is the full exchange: VEGA: ""I want to ask you about those encouraging headlines that we're talking about this morning, this new study showing just how well vaccines are working to prevent severe illness. Given that, is it time to start rethinking how we're living with this virus, that it’s potentially here to stay?"" WALENSKY: ""A really important study if I may just summarize it, a study of 1.2 million people who were vaccinated between December and October and demonstrated that severe disease occurred in about 0.015% of the people who receive their primary series. And death in 0.003% of those people. The overwhelming number of deaths, over 75%, occurred in people who had at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who were unwell to begin with. And yes, really encouraging news in the context of omicron. This means not only just to get your primary series, but to get your booster series. And yes, we’re really encouraged by these results."" The study involved just over 1.2 million people who completed their primary vaccination series — two shots for mRNA vaccines — from December 2020 through October 2021. It found that severe COVID-19-associated outcomes or death were rare among the group — 36 died of COVID-19. Risk factors included being over 65 years old or having a suppressed immune system. All people who experienced severe disease had at least one risk factor, the report said, and 28 of the people who died, or 78%, had at least four. After misinformation started to spread over the weekend about Walensky’s remarks, ABC News published an extended version of the interview with a note at the end. PolitiFact reached out to the CDC but did not hear back. ABC News declined to comment.  Websites and posts on social media claimed that Walensky said 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities. The claims, based on an edited clip of a TV interview, misrepresent what she said.  She was referring to a study that involved vaccinated individuals only, and said over 75% of deaths in that group involved individuals who had multiple other diseases and conditions.

Headline about Japan dropping vaccine mandates is misleading: Japan never mandated COVID-19 vaccines
","An article shared on social media falsely claims that Japan pulled the plug on compulsory COVID-19 vaccines. ""Japan Drops All Vaxxine Mandates, Places Myocarditis Warning on Label,"" said the headline on an article from Brisbane National Review. The article was shared on Facebook and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline gives the misleading impression that Japan rescinded a vaccine mandate because of concerns over myocarditis. That’s not the case. Japan never implemented a COVID-19 vaccine mandate in the first place. The country has not had any compulsory vaccinations at all since 1994. And with 80% of its population having received two doses of coronavirus vaccine, Japan leads the Group of Seven developed nations in COVID-19 vaccination rates.  Japan’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout was slow compared with its Western counterparts; vaccination of senior citizens began in mid-April 2021, and eligibility for others began in late June. But as of Jan. 10, 2022, the nation of 126 million people had administered 210 million doses, according to the prime minister’s office. Booster shots began in December, starting with medical personnel. ""Although we encourage all citizens to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, it is not compulsory or mandatory,"" according to the government’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website. Prior to its successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign, Japan was known for very low levels of public trust in vaccines. The country has not had any compulsory vaccinations since 1994, when it revised its vaccination law following a court ruling that held the government liable for adverse reactions to some vaccines. ""Forged in the aftermath of World War II, Japan’s Constitution enshrines civil liberties,"" the Japan Times reported. ""For practical purposes, that means it hasn’t deployed lockdowns or compulsory mask rules as part of its pandemic approach. It’s taken the same approach to vaccination, with the health ministry discouraging discrimination against the unvaccinated and shot requirements in the workplace."" The article shared on Facebook also said that Japan had placed a myocarditis warning on vaccine labels, which is accurate. The action came in early December, months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did the same in response to rare incidences of heart inflammation in people receiving mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. Experts have said that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the small risk of myocarditis. An article headline said, ""Japan Drops All Vaxxine Mandates, Places Myocarditis Warning on Label."" The headline gives the misleading impression that Japan rescinded an existing vaccine mandate because of concerns over myocarditis. That’s not the case. Japan placed myocarditis warnings on vaccine labels in December, but it never implemented a COVID-19 vaccine mandate and has no compulsory vaccinations at all. We rate this claim Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F662C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/12/blog-posting/headline-about-japan-dropping-vaccine-mandates-mis/

Data show the unvaccinated are 20 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people
","On Jan. 10, when the U.S. reported 1.35 million new COVID-19 cases — the highest daily total for any country on record — White House press secretary Jen Psaki faced pushback regarding President Joe Biden’s assertion that the pandemic is, at this point, ""a pandemic of the unvaccinated."" During a press briefing that day, Fox News reporter Peter Doocy implied that Biden’s characterization was inaccurate. ""I understand that the science says that vaccines prevent death,"" he said. ""But I’m triple vaxxed, still got COVID. You’re triple vaxxed, still got COVID. Why is the president still referring to this as a ‘pandemic of the unvaccinated?’""  In her response, Psaki emphasized that vaccination status contributes to a ""significant difference"" in COVID-19 experiences. ""I had been triple vaxxed,"" she said. ""I had minor symptoms. There is a huge difference between that and being unvaccinated.""  She continued: ""You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you’re not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die. And those are significant, serious statistics. So, yes, the impact for people who are unvaccinated is far more dire than those who are vaccinated."" A spokesperson for Psaki said she was referring to publicly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the CDC data support her claim. In October, unvaccinated people had 10 times the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and 20 times the risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with people who were fully vaccinated with additional or booster doses, according to the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker. On COVID-19 hospitalizations, CDC data from the end of November 2021 indicated that unvaccinated adults ages 18 years and older were hospitalized with COVID-19 at a rate of about 67.8 per 100,000. By comparison, the rate for fully vaccinated individuals was about 3.9 per 100,000, meaning unvaccinated people were about 17 times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. Data from Texas also supports Psaki’s claims. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, data from September indicated that ""Texans not vaccinated against COVID-19 were about 20 times more likely to suffer a COVID-19-associated death and 13 times more likely to test positive than people who were fully vaccinated."" With the U.S. now averaging more than 700,000 new coronavirus cases every day, the data shows that people who are unvaccinated are at a higher risk of severe illness and death than those who are vaccinated. The CDC says scientists are currently researching how protected fully vaccinated people will be against infection, hospitalization and death where the omicron variant is concerned. The highly transmissible variant began to spread in the U.S. in early December and is fueling a surge that experts predict could last through January. But some of the most recent omicron surge data from cities New York and Seattle indicates that COVID-19 vaccines still ""radically reduce the chance of severe COVID illness,"" according to a data analysis by the New York Times.  Data on COVID-19 deaths from those cities indicates a relatively low risk of death for people who are vaccinated. Deaths among the vaccinated are expected to rise due to an increase in vaccinated people who have contracted the virus. ""They are likely to be concentrated among people in vulnerable health, including the elderly and those with a serious underlying medical condition like a previous organ transplant — especially if they’re not boosted."" Data on deaths lags behind data on infections by about three weeks. But the Times reported that the early numbers suggest any increases in deaths among the vaccinated will be comparatively modest. ""Deaths among unvaccinated New Yorkers and Seattleites had already begun to surge in December,"" the Times wrote. ""Deaths among the vaccinated had not."" Psaki said ""You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you’re not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die,"" compared to people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  The most complete data available from the CDC and research from Texas support this claim. While those studies are based on data collected prior to omicron variant spreading in the U.S., early data from New York and Seattle in December and January continue to suggest a significant gap between the experiences of the unvaccinated and the vaccinated who become infected. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E1AD40>],/factchecks/2022/jan/12/jen-psaki/data-suggests-unvaccinated-are-20-times-more-likel/
