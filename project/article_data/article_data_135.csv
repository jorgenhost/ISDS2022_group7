Contrary to Eileen Filler-Corn's claim, Gov. Ralph Northam's plan budget would hike taxes
","House Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, recently accused a Republican lawmaker of spreading ""incorrect information"" about Gov. Ralph Northam’s proposed state budget. ""There is no tax increase in the governor’s plan,"" she said during a Jan. 15 floor speech, challenging opposite claims by Del. Tim Hugo, R-Fairfax. ""Rather, the Commonwealth is responding to actions, again, by the Trump administration that clearly, also, exploded the deficit."" No tax hike proposed by Northam, Filler-Corns’s fellow Democrat? Let’s take a look. The story begins in December 2017, when the Republican-led Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed, sweeping permanent tax cuts for businesses and temporary reductions for households. Among its provisions, the law offers an incentive for many filers to take a newly-set standard deduction on their federal income tax returns instead of itemizing. The standard deduction was nearly doubled, from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples, and from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals. In return, the law reduced popular itemized deductions for mortgage interest, and for paid state and local taxes. It eliminated deductions for moving expenses. That put the federal income tax rules out of whack with Virginia laws, which sets the standard deduction at a much lower $3,000 for single filers and $6,000 for married couples filing jointly. Virginia also requires all filers who itemized on their U.S. income tax returns to do likewise on their state returns, and those who take the federal standard deduction to also take Virginia’s standard deduction. As a result, an estimated 26 percent of Virginia filers - or 600,000 filers - could lose some of the benefits of the federal tax cut by by not being able to itemize in Virginia and seeing their state income tax bills rise. Their average increase would be $392 on this year’s returns, according to a study Northam commissioned last summer by Chainbridge Software, LLC in Fairfax County. Chainbridge estimates that the federal tax changes will create a $1.2 billion windfall for state government during the next two budget years, starting July 1, 2019. How to use that money has become a major debate. Northam and many Democratic legislators want to use $216 million to give a state tax income break to low-income households, and spend the rest on various initiatives, including raising teacher salaries and aiding local economic development. Republicans, who narrowly control both chambers of the General Assembly, say Northam’s proposal is a non-starter. Many say it would unfairly transfer wealth from middle-class families to low-income households. GOP lawmakers are pushing a plan that would let Virginia filers itemize their state income taxes even if they took the standard deduction of their federal returns. That would allow a fair refund of the windfall to taxpayers, they say. Filler-Corn’s logic We asked Filler-Corn’s office to explain her contention that Northam’s budget doesn’t raise taxes. Adam Zuckerman, her senior advisor, answered in an email. He wrote: ""Delegate Filler-Corn's statement on the House floor that there is no tax increase in the governor's proposed budget is correct. Any tax change that will currently impact Virginians is as a result of the actions taken at the federal level last year. The current debate in the General Assembly is over how Virginia will respond to those federal actions and use any resulting excess revenue."" Our ruling Filler-Corn said, ""There is no tax increase in the governor’s budget plan."" Any boosts state income tax bills, her senior advisor says, ripples from federal tax reform passed in 2017, not Gov. Northam’s proposals. Because of those changes, Virginia’s income tax laws have fallen far out of sync with those of the U.S. government. Northam’s plan would keep the disparity intact and, as a result, 26 percent of Virginia filers would see their state income tax bills rise - by an average of $392. That would create a $1.2 billion state windfall over two years and Northam proposes spending most of it. Filler-Corn’s explanation suggests the governor’s hands are tied. But Northam has had options. He could have recommended that Virginia laws be brought closer in conformity with federal tax code, ending the chance that any Virginian would pay pay a higher income tax. The governor chose otherwise. As we’ve noted, it would not be an across-the-board tax hike; it would affect one of four Virginia filers. That slightly helps Filler-Corn. We rate her statement Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2019/jan/29/eileen-filler-corn/contrary-eileen-filler-corns-claim-gov-ralph-north/

Trump tweets that 58,000 noncitizens voted in Texas. That hasn't been proven
","When Texas election officials announced their plan to vet the legal status of 95,000 voters, President Donald Trump took notice. But in a tweet about the matter, he got the facts wrong. ""58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 27. ""All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped. Strong voter ID! @foxandfriends"" 58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped. Strong voter ID! @foxandfriends Trump has often alleged massive voter fraud, including by noncitizens, without any evidence. In this case, Trump is miscasting information from the Texas Secretary of State. The state's list is not the final word on how many people have voted illegally. It is now up to county officials to collect more information about these voters and determine their citizenship status. It's possible in some cases, for example, that someone obtained a driver’s license before earning their citizenship.  The whittling process that is just starting across Texas has played out in other states that mounted similar voter roll purges based on driver’s license data, said Justin Levitt, a Loyola law school professor and expert on voter registration. ""Percentages are infinitesimal of the original eye-popping headline,"" Levitt said. For nearly a year, the Texas Secretary of State and the Texas Department of Public Safety have been trying to identify noncitizen voters. (This started long before Gov. Greg Abbott appointed David Whitley as secretary of State in December.) They argue that any fraud undermines the integrity of elections while voting rights advocates say it is an attempt to suppress voter participation. Voting in an election in which the person knows he or she is not eligible to vote is a second-degree felony in Texas. State officials looked at two sets of data for their current investigation: the names of people who provided documents indicating they were not citizens when they obtained a driver’s license or a state ID, and the names of people who registered to vote. That resulted in a list of 95,000 people with a current driver’s license or state ID who also had a voter registration record in Texas. Of those, 58,000 people voted in elections back to 1996, said Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the secretary of State. But the same advisory that is the source of those numbers urged caution in interpreting them, using all capital letters to describe the similar records as ""WEAK matches."" The announcement didn’t say 58,000 noncitizens definitely voted. Despite the warning, the numbers inspired some overhyped reactions, including from the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who tweeted a ""voter fraud alert."" County officials can’t cancel a voter’s registration based on the information provided so far. The advisory states that if registrars have reason to believe a voter is not eligible, they should send a letter to the voters asking for proof of citizenship within 30 days. After that point, election officials can cancel the person’s registration. Voting rights advocates raised a key concern about the data: driver’s license data may not reflect a person’s current citizenship status. ""Indeed, between 52,000-63,000 are naturalized every year in Texas,"" Texas Civil Rights Project spokesman Zenén Jaimes Pérez told PolitiFact. We asked the Secretary of State’s office if it’s possible that some of the people in the 58,000 or 95,000 groups have since become citizens. ""That’s up to the county voter registrars and/or the Attorney General’s office to determine,"" Taylor responded. On Jan. 28, county election officials across Texas were starting the process of examining the information from the state. So far, it is too early to determine if those on the list are actual noncitizen voters, said Chris Davis, the head of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators and the administrator in Williamson County. Bruce Elfant, the voter registrar in Travis County and a Democrat, said that he has concerns about whether the data reflects current citizenship information. ""We really know very little at this point,"" he told PolitiFact. ""Those who weighed in alleging voter fraud, I would say it is premature and irresponsible. … This is going to be long and complicated."" Douglas Ray, a special assistant county attorney in Harris County, told the Houston Chronicle that he’s skeptical of the use of Department of Public Safety records that he described as ""notoriously"" outdated for the citizenship status of drivers. Ray said the county is going to compare the list of names from the state with a list of people who have gone through naturalization ceremonies. In addition to outdated citizenship information, it’s possible that there are mismatches of people with similar names. Myrna Pérez, who works on voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice, said she was once denied an absentee ballot by the state of Texas because her mother, who has the same name, had already voted. ""That may sound like a one-off, but actually it’s not when we are talking about databases that big,"" she said. While the final outcome in Texas could be months away, we know that proven instances of noncitizens voting in U.S. elections are rare. A national database of criminal convictions of election fraud by the conservative Heritage Foundation shows four individuals who have been convicted of noncitizen voting in Texas. In November, a Texas appeals court upheld the conviction of Rosa Maria Ortega, a green card holder, who was sentenced to eight years in jail after voting multiple times. And on Jan. 15, Paxton announced that a noncitizen was charged with illegal voting. A 2017 report by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice found that election officials in 42 jurisdictions referred an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting (out of more than 23 million votes) for further investigation or prosecution. In August 2018, federal prosecutors in North Carolina announced charges for 19 foreign nationals believed to have voted in the 2016 general election. So far, 10 have pleaded guilty to voting, and one pled guilty to aiding and abetting a noncitizen in falsely claiming citizenship in order to vote, a spokesman for the U.S. District Attorney in the eastern district of North Carolina said. Florida engaged in a controversial attempt to search for noncitizen voters based on driver’s license leading up to the 2012 election. The search was rife with errors, turning up the name of  a Brooklyn-born World War II veteran as a noncitizen voter. The state initially identified 182,000 people but ended the purge after removing just 85 names. Before we issue our ruling, a quick word about Trump's call for ""strong voter ID."" Texas already has among the strictest voter ID laws in the country. The original 2011 law required voters to show a government-issued ID such as a driver’s license or passport. After a court found that the law had a discriminatory effect, the state passed a new law that allowed voters to provide other forms of ID, and it survived a federal appellate test in 2018. Trump said, ""58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote."" Trump omits that even the Texas Secretary of State has expressed caution in these numbers, calling the match in records ""WEAK"" and outlining a process county elections officials can undergo to check the flagged voters. At this point, we don’t know how many on the list culled over 22 years of data will be proven to be noncitizens who cast ballots — some may have gotten their citizenship after their driver’s license and voted legally. Because he inaccurately characterized the early stage of what Texas actually reported, we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2019/jan/28/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-tweets-58000-noncitizens-voted-texas/

Fact-checking Trump's claim on cost of illegal immigration, number of immigrants here illegally
","The partial shutdown of the federal government is over — at least for three weeks — since President Donald Trump and lawmakers agreed to reopen the government without the $5.7 billion request from Trump for a border wall with Mexico. But that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating his takes on illegal immigration: that it’s rampant and comes at a staggering cost. ""We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country. So ridiculous! DHS,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 27. We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country. So ridiculous! DHS Trump's numbers are precise to the point that one might think they are drawn from a report. But it’s unclear where they come from, and immigration experts and demographers refute related estimates. We don’t know how Trump determined that the cost of illegal immigration ""so far this year"" is $18,959,495,168, or that the ""cost Friday was $603,331,392."" Trump’s tweet ends with ""DHS"" — the acronym for the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the enforcement of immigration laws. We asked DHS and the White House to provide the research Trump used for his claim. Neither presented information. Last month, Trump claimed illegal immigration cost the United States $250 billion a year. We rated that False because even the highest estimates we found were nowhere near $250 billion. The right-leaning Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimated in a September 2017 report that the federal, state and local costs of more than 12.5 million people in the United States illegally was around $135 billion. After calculating this population’s tax contributions, the group said the total economic impact of illegal immigration was around $116 billion (up from $113 billion in 2013). If Trump based his latest claim on the $250 billion annual estimate he used in December and divided that by 12 months, then he would arrive at about $20.8 billion a month cost, slightly higher than his ""so far this year"" estimate. But that’s not necessarily a precise way of calculating illegal immigration costs. Trump regularly tweets about the cost of illegal immigration, and generally omits the basis for his numbers. On Dec. 4, 2018, he said the cost was $250 billion a year, about two weeks later, he said it was $275 billion a year. In 2016, he said it was $113 billion a year. Most estimates contradict Trump’s assertion that ""there are at least"" 25.7 million immigrants living in the country illegally. Widely accepted estimates say it’s closer to 11 million. A December 2018 DHS report estimated that there were 12 million immigrants in the country illegally in January 2015. The report acknowledged estimates from two other sources, Pew Research Center and the Center for Migration Studies. The three sets of estimates (from DHS, Pew, Center for Migration Studies) were ""roughly similar,"" the DHS report said, but there were differences in the assumptions and specific methodologies, leading to ""somewhat different numbers and trends."" The DHS report did not mention a September 2018 study from researchers at Yale University, which estimated there was an average of 22.1 million immigrants in the country illegally in 2016. A conservative estimate is 16.7 million, the Yale study said, with the high end at 29.5 million The 11 million estimate derives from population surveys and legal immigration records; whereas the Yale estimate used an alternative approach ""grounded in fundamental principles of demographic flows,"" the Yale study said. Demographers and immigration experts have criticized the Yale study. Some say that it’s not adequately grounded in empirical research about illegal immigration patterns; that it significantly overestimates migration from Mexico; and that, if there are millions of additional people in the United States, then there would be more related demographic records, such as birth and school records for their children. In a Jan. 27 CBS ""Face the Nation"" interview, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney couldn’t say where Trump got his estimate. The number has to be higher than 11 million though, Mulvaney said, citing illegal immigration numbers from the past three months. ""I'm not exactly sure where the president got that number this morning,"" Mulvaney said. ""But I think what you see him trying to do is point out how silly this debate is."" Trump said, ""We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country."" The source of Trump’s claim is unclear. We asked DHS and the White House to back Trump’s statement, but neither provided studies or any other data to support it. Trump previously falsely claimed that the cost of illegal immigration was $250 billion a year. Even the highest annual estimates we found were significantly lower than that amount ($116 billion, after factoring in tax contributions). Most estimates say there are around 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. A recent study from Yale University researchers said a mean number was 22.1 million, but several demographers have pointed flaws in the assumptions and findings of that study. Without evidence from Trump or his administration to back this statement, we rate it False.",/factchecks/2019/jan/28/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim-cost-illegal-imm/
"['West Virginia', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Joe Manchin']","
Is Donald Trump's approval rating highest of all in West Virginia?
","During a recent interview with Bloomberg television, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was asked about how his constituents feel about the government shutdown and the immigration policy dispute that caused it. In the Jan. 8 interview -- conducted a few weeks before President Donald Trump and congressional leaders ended the shutdown -- Manchin said some West Virginia residents are concerned about losing the flow of federal checks and about legal immigration visas. He prefaced these comments by noting how popular President Donald Trump is in his state. ""President Trump has the strongest support percentage-wise in our state than any other state in the nation,"" Manchin said. ""He won West Virginia by almost 43 percentage points, and he's been carrying close to 60 percent approval."" Just how supportive of Trump is West Virginia? Let’s break down Manchin’s statement into three parts. It’s clear that West Virginia is at or near the top, but it’s hard to say for sure if they are No. 1. When we reached out to Manchin’s communications director, Jonathan Kott, he said the senator was referring to the 2016 election results. However, Manchin used the present tense to describe Trump’s level of support in the state, and two years after the 2016 election, Trump’s election results are no longer an up-to-date measure of his support levels. So we turned to state-by-state ratings by Morning Consult, the only survey group today that offered recent presidential approval scores in all 50 states at the time Manchin made his remarks. The most recent figures are from December 2018. By this measure, West Virginia actually ranks No. 2 in the nation, according to the most recent report. The December 2018 approval rating for Trump reached 61 percent in West Virginia, but that was a few points below Wyoming, with 64 percent. That’s within the poll’s margin of error, which ranges from one to five percentage points depending on the size of the state. This means that West Virginia and Wyoming are effectively neck-and-neck in Trump approval -- but Alabama and possibly Mississippi (at 58 percent and 56 percent, respectively) could also be neck-and-neck with West Virginia. This part of his remark refers to actual electoral results in 2016. Trump won 67.85 percent of the vote in West Virginia in 2016, with Hillary Clinton taking 26.18 percent. That’s a difference of 41.67 percentage points. So he’s off only slightly. Manchin is on target here -- in the December Morning Consult survey, Trump had a 61 percent approval rating in West Virginia, meaning that Manchin actually understated the figure slightly. Earlier polls were in the same range. A WVMetroNews/The Dominion Post poll in September 2018 found 60 percent approval for Trump, while an October 2018 poll by WSAZ and Gray Television found 58 percent approval. Manchin said, ""President Trump has the strongest support percentage-wise in  our state than any other state in the nation. He won West Virginia by almost 43 percentage points and he's been carrying close to the 60 percent approval."" Manchin is close on all three measurements of Trump’s support in West Virginia. His main point -- that Trump remains popular in the state -- holds. But we should note that it’s difficult to say that West Virginia tops all other states in its Trump approval. Wyoming, Alabama and Mississippi also have very high levels of support, and each could plausibly claim to be the most Trump-supporting state.   We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/jan/28/joe-manchin/donald-trumps-approval-rating-highest-all-west-vir/
"['Crime', 'Illinois', 'Garry McCarthy']","
Did McCarthy rein in Chicago’s high murder rate?
","In his bid for mayor, Garry McCarthy frequently highlights his record as the city’s one-time police superintendent, comparing crime in those years to a surge in violence that occured after he was fired by Mayor Rahm Emanuel amid fallout from the police shooting death of Laquan McDonald. Last month, we rated Half True a claim McCarthy made about shootings by police overall plunging under his leadership. In a recent TV ad, McCarthy invokes yet again his four-plus years at the helm of the Chicago Police Department. ""You might not remember, but when I was superintendent, violent crime in Chicago was down, gun arrests were up. We had the lowest murder rates in a generation,"" McCarthy says in the ad. ""How did we do it? A cutting edge-anti gang plan that combined community policing with data to track gang activity. We met with families touched by gang violence and attacked the problem from the inside. As mayor, I’ll rededicate us to those smart principles and make Chicago safe again."" To reinforce those claims, the ad flashes citations from newsclips across the screen as he speaks. But the articles highlighted don’t completely reinforce McCarthy’s spoken claims. One, a New York Times article titled ""Monthly Killings are Down to a 40-Year Low in the City,"" was published in 2002, nearly a decade before McCarthy arrived in Chicago from the East Coast. It referred to murders in New York City, not Chicago. That discrepancy prompted us to dig deeper into the rest of the ad. First, it’s important to note there is no such thing as a ‘good’ murder rate. One life lost is too many. Yet McCarthy’s central premise is that he has a record of making the grim tally less so, accomplishing a historic turnaround at the Chicago Police Department that left the city safer than it had been for years. In two of the roughly four and half years McCarthy served as superintendent — 2013 and 2014 — the total number of murders in Chicago did fall to a level not seen since 1965, department records show. The problem is those years were bookended by two others under McCarthy in which murders spiked. Loading... It’s also worth noting that a Chicago Magazine investigation raised questions about whether data manipulation drove down official murder statistics in 2013 and 2014 on McCarthy’s watch, a claim he has disputed. McCarthy’s first full year running CPD was 2012. It saw a surge in violence that critics at the time said tracked closely with his decision to disband large specialized teams of officers that had been deployed to swarm areas when violence erupted and keep it from getting out of hand. That surge continued into 2013 with an especially deadly January, but then eased significantly after McCarthy essentially reintroduced the very saturation team strategy he had abandoned. McCarthy also uses the term ""murder rate,"" which often gets used interchangeably with actual murders but is not the same thing. The rate is a reflection of how many murders a city logs per 100,000 residents, and since Chicago has a much smaller population than it did decades ago lower numbers of actual murders don’t necessarily translate into record-low rates. Historical crime data gathered by the FBI show that McCarthy would be correct — though not by much — if he had confined his claim about the lowest murder rates in a generation to 2013 and 2014. The rates for those years — 15.3 per 100,000 people in 2013 and 15.2 the next year — were indeed lower than they had been in the previous 28 years, but still fell just slightly below the 15.5 rate for Chicago in 2004, when murders began a noticeable series of annual plunges. In 2012 under McCarthy, however, the murder rate stood at 18.5 per 100,000 residents, higher than the years leading up to his appointment. In 2015, when he ran the department for all but a few weeks, it jumped again to 17.5. The following year, with McCarthy gone, it jumped more than 60 percent to 28.1. The FBI data also make clear that the decline in city murders and murder rates during those two years under McCarthy was likely a continuation of a trend that began in the early 1990s and accelerated significantly in 2004. Other U.S. cities experienced similar reductions in violence over the same time frame. A McCarthy spokesman pointed to a slice of the same FBI data when we asked for an explanation of the candidate’s claims. However, the numbers the campaign provided us only reached back to 2005 — hardly a generation’s worth and partially obscuring the long-term pattern of decline the city had experienced. McCarthy said, ""we had the lowest murder rates in a generation,"" pointing to his strategy as police superintendent for combating gang violence as the reason for the decline. During two of McCarthy’s four-plus years with the department, murder rates did fall to a level not seen in decades. But violent crime had been dropping steadily in Chicago for years before that, tracking a national trend. McCarthy also presided over two years in which murders spiked, and critics at the time said his crime-fighting policies were at least partly to blame. His statement cherry-picks statistics and ignores the broader historical context of crime in Chicago. We rate it Mostly False.

"['Economy', 'Labor', 'Workers', 'Vermont', 'Phil Scott']","
Vermont's governor says the entire state is losing workers. The data doesn't agree.
","Gov. Phil Scott is determined to turn around the decline in Vermont’s workforce. The demographic woes facing Vermont’s employee pool was the focus of Scott’s inaugural address two weeks ago and again front and center during his budget address this week. ""As I have said many times, I believe our biggest threat is our declining workforce. It is the root of every problem we face,"" the governor told members of the House and Senate gathered in the Statehouse on Thursday. Underlining his point, Scott said the entire state was feeling the pain. ""To put this in perspective: every county, except Chittenden, has seen a decline in the number of people working. Every county, including Chittenden, has fewer people available for work,"" he said. The governor’s remark seemed to challenge conventional wisdom that Chittenden County, home to Vermont’s largest city and 26 percent of the state’s total population, is somewhat immune to the demographic struggles facing the rest of the state. But is the governor right? We decided to break down the data ourselves to find out just how hard Chittenden County has been hit by the demographic downturn being felt elsewhere (Essex County, for example, has seen a 20 percent decline in its labor force). Rebecca Kelley, the governor’s spokesperson, said his source for the claim was the economist for the Vermont Department of Labor. ""As advised by our Department of Labor economist, ‘fewer people available for work’ refers to the technical term ‘labor force,’"" she said in an email. So we turned to the Department of Labor’s most recent labor force data, released on January 18. (After publication of this article, Kelley said calculations using this data were premature -- though there is no indication that the data is provisional. She said figures will be finalized in March.)   The high point for Chittenden County’s labor force, until this year, was 95,835 people in 2012, according to the department’s data on annual averages. In July 2012, the number reached 95,869. That figure dropped for the next year, then went up a bit in 2014, then dropped again until it bottomed out at an average of 95,181 in January 2016. But since then it’s been rebounding. In mid-2018, Chittenden County’s labor force cracked 96,000 people for the first time ever. The high point was 96,191, in June. There was a drop-off in the second half of 2018, but seasonal changes in the labor force makes month-to-month data meaningless as an indicator of trends. If Scott had made the claim during his budget address last year, he would have been on solid ground: 2017’s average labor force was lower than the 2012 figures by about 190 people. (We suspect the governor was using old data, based on the spreadsheet Kelley sent us) But even then, the statement would be missing some crucial context. Chittenden County’s labor force has been rising steadily for two straight years. And there’s been a steep upward trend since 2000, when the labor force was just 85,086 on average. That’s not to say that Vermont isn’t facing a serious decline in its labor force. In 10 of the state’s 14 counties, there is a clear downward trend in the labor force (Washington, Franklin and Grand Isle are fairly stable). The governor may have been relying on old information when he said Chittenden County has fewer people available for work today than in the past. But if we could find the correct data, his staff probably could have done the same.

Gov. Tony Evers reverses position on pulling Wisconsin from Obamacare lawsuit
","One of the hallmarks of Democrat Tony Evers’ campaign for governor was his support for the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. One part of that was a pledge to withdraw Wisconsin from a multi-state lawsuit seeking to overturn Obamacare. Under Republican Gov. Scott Walker, Wisconsin is one of 20 states in the lawsuit, which was filed in February 2018 in Texas. In December 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled in the states’ favor, saying Obamacare is invalid, but the ruling will not take effect while the matter is appealed. On Jan. 4, 2019, House Democrats officially filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit in defense of Obamacare. After Evers beat Walker in the November 2018 election, the Republican-controlled Legislature passed a lame-duck measure that gave lawmakers -- not Evers -- the final say on whether Wisconsin remains in the lawsuit. Yet there was Evers during his Jan. 22, 2018 State of the State speech issuing this declaration, to cheers from Democrats: ""The people of Wisconsin voted for a change this November and asked us to stop playing politics with their health care. That’s why I’m announcing tonight that I have fulfilled a promise I made to the people of Wisconsin by directing Attorney General (Josh) Kaul to withdraw from a lawsuit that would gut coverage for 2.4 million Wisconsinites who have pre-existing conditions."" Less than 24 hours later, all that was off. What happened? The nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau issued a memo that said Evers doesn’t have the power to get Wisconsin out of the lawsuit under the GOP-passed law. ""There is thus no provision in (a statute cited by Evers) allowing the governor to request, require, or approve the attorney general to compromise or discontinue an action,"" wrote Sarah Walkenhorst, an attorney with the bureau. In a case such as this one, only the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee has the power to decide to end Wisconsin’s participation in the case, she wrote. She drafted the memo at the request of Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, a Juneau Republican. While Republicans argued Evers had asked Kaul to take an illegal action, Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said Jan. 23, 2019 that the governor ""has not directed the attorney general to take any specific course of action; he has simply withdrawn his authority for this lawsuit."" The next day, Jan. 24, 2019, Kaul asked lawmakers to end the state's involvement in the lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act -- further evidence that Evers couldn't do what he said he did. One day later, Jan. 25, 2019, Evers said he ‘always believed’ Kaul would seek permission to withdraw from the lawsuit.""There's nothing inconsistent with what I said and what was actually going to happen,"" Evers told reporters in Milwaukee. ""I always knew that Josh Kaul was going to the Joint Finance Committee."" In any case, with lightning speed, Evers went from an applause line boast of taking action to fulfill a promise to basically stating a political position: That he’s opposed to the lawsuit. At PolitiFact, we use the Flip-O-Meter to measure whether politicians have been consistent on an issue. Here we are looking narrowly at the question of directing Kaul to withdraw the state from the lawsuit. First Evers said he had done it. Then he acknowledged he really hadn’t. That’s a complete reversal. And, in our book, a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2019/jan/26/tony-evers/gov-tony-evers-reverses-position-pulling-wisconsin/

Trump said 1 in 3 migrant women is sexually assaulted in journey to the United States. Is that true?
","In an attempt to get Democrats to approve funding for a border wall with Mexico, President Donald Trump said there were tragic consequences to illegal immigration. He offered as an example statistics on women sexually assaulted on their journey to the United States. ""One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north,"" Trump said Jan. 19. ""In fact, many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey up to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually accosted or assaulted."" Trump noted the 1-in-3 figure during a televised proposal to end the government shutdown. Trump is seeking $5.7 billion for a border wall. In exchange, he offered to continue a temporary protection from deportation for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants in the country illegally, and for immigrants with expiring Temporary Protected Status. PolitiFact wondered about the accuracy of Trump’s statement on the number of women sexually assaulted. Advocates for immigrant rights have long stressed that migrants coming to the United States illegally face dangers along the journey, including sexual abuse. A definitive number or percentage of women abused is difficult to determine; not all people report the abuse, not all women making the journey are interviewed, and overall, data is limited. ""The percentage of women who have been sexually abused or assaulted is all over the place, since there is no single representative sample of all the women who cross Mexico to reach the United States,"" said Nestor P. Rodriguez, a sociology professor and a research associate of the Population Research Center at the University of Texas. Rodriguez said he's heard from immigrant and refugee advocates higher percentages of women abused or assaulted, but those figures are not based on a representative sample of all women who cross Mexico. The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for information. But we found a similar claim posted on the White House website citing a 2017 Doctors Without Borders report. A May 2017 report from Doctors Without Borders said that of more than 400 people surveyed in Mexico at facilities that help migrants, 31.4 percent of women had been sexually abused during their transit through Mexico. (The majority of migrants interviewed were men.) The findings provided a ""snapshot in time"" drawing from a population accessible to the medical group, and was not necessarily representative of all migrants traveling through Mexico to the United States, the report said. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) gives medical and mental health care to migrants and refugees fleeing violence in Central America and traveling through Mexico. The migrants and refugees are ""preyed upon by criminal organizations, sometimes with the tacit approval or complicity of national authorities, and subjected to violence and other abuses,"" including abduction, theft, extortion, torture, and rape, the group said. For its 2017 report, Doctors Without Borders reviewed medical data from 2015 through December 2016 and a 2015 survey of 467 people encountered in ""albergues,"" the hostels, mobile health clinics and centers where migrants seek food, shelter, information, and health care. A significant number of migrants reported sexual violence, unwanted sex, and transactional sex in exchange for shelter, protection or for money, the report said. ""Considering a comprehensive definition of those categories, out of the 429 migrants and refugees that answered (sexual and gender-based violence) questions, 31.4 percent of women and 17.2 percent of men had been sexually abused during their transit through Mexico,"" the report said. ""Considering only rape and other forms of direct sexual violence, 10.7 percent of women and 4.4 percent of men were affected during their transit through Mexico,"" it added. (Doctors Without Borders did not use the term sexual assault, as Trump did; it used the term sexual abuse to describe various types of sexual violence against women and men.) The report said Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) ""avoids drawing sweeping conclusions; however the survey provides valuable information about the realities that many people on this route experienced, in a specific time period, as reported to MSF teams."" Dr. Joanne Liu, international president of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières, in a December speech during an immigration conference in Morocco, also said that one-third of women reported being sexually abused during their transit toward the United States. People in Mexico and Central America ""know of the suffering they will experience as they take to the road. But even the knowledge of such risk does not deter them,"" Liu said.   ""Women and girls seek contraception because they simply expect to be raped during their journeys,"" Liu said. ""People are forced to choose between the violence of home and the distant possibility of a future with hope."" Trump said, ""One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north."" A 2017 report from Doctors Without Borders said 31.4 percent of women had been sexually abused during their transit through Mexico. That's based on a 2015 survey of more than 400 migrants interviewed in facilities where migrants seek assistance. (The majority of migrants interviewed were men.) Doctors Without Borders said its report provided a snapshot in time of the perils migrants face, but said it wasn’t necessarily representative of the entire migrant population traveling through Mexico.

","Margaret Sanger, the founder of the organization that became Planned Parenthood, ruffled some feathers in her day, namely for her vocal support of birth control and women’s reproductive rights.

One such phrase is currently being shared on social media. A post alongside an image of Sanger claims that in 1922 she said the following: ""Slav, Latin and Hebrew immigrants are human weeds...a deadweight of human waste. Blacks, soldiers and Jews are a menace to race."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could not locate any record of Margaret Sanger ever saying that, though it appears to have circulated on social media since approximately July 2015, as other fact-checkers have noted. We did find an April 1923 New York Times article in which she said the word ""weeds,"" but she didn’t link it to any race or ethnicity: ""I was merely thinking of the poor mothers of congested districts of the East Side who had so poignantly begged me for relief, in order that the children they had already brought into the world might have a chance to grow into strong and stalwart Americans . . . Birth Control is not contraception indiscriminately and thoughtlessly practiced. It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks — those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization."" While Sanger has been routinely criticized for supporting eugenics—the belief of improving the population by controlled breeding for desirable characteristics—historians and scholars who have studied Sanger’s life challenge the idea that she was racist, and say her opinions concerned public health, not race. In a PolitiFact New Hampshire story, Ruth Engs, professor emerita at the Indiana University School of Public Health and an expert in the eugenics movement, said that while subscribers to this ideology included some who wanted to create some sort of master race, ""a minority of eugenicists"" said they believed this. At the time that Sanger was active, Engs wrote, ""the purpose of eugenics was to improve the human race by having people be more healthy through exercise, recreation in parks, marriage to someone free from sexually transmitted diseases, well-baby clinics, immunizations, clean food and water, proper nutrition, non-smoking and drinking."" The philosophy ultimately fell out of favor during World War II, however, as Nazis adopted eugenics to support exterminating non-Aryan races. We spoke with Ellen Chesler, a Sanger biographer and senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute in New York, about the quote. ""She never said that. It’s a completely incorrect, made-up quote,"" Chesler told us. ""The people on the left of eugenics (at the time) believed in a truly democratic society, that opportunity should not be based on the color of someone’s skin or ethnic background, but on ability, that opportunity should rest with those who are the most able … Sanger believed that if you were able you should be given opportunity, no matter what you looked liked or where you came from."" An image circulating on social media claims Sanger said, ""Slav, Latin and Hebrew immigrants are human weeds...a deadweight of human waste. Blacks, soldiers and Jews are a menace to race,"" in 1922. The closest quotation we could find was from a 1923, not 1922, New York Times article, and it doesn’t even come close to the phrase in the meme. Margaret Sanger did leave behind a complicated legacy and, at times, said some outlandish things – but she never said this.

Have 7 million Americans become uninsured since 2016?
","Concern over health insurance helped Democrats take back the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections. And the issue remains a potent one for the party. In a Jan. 23 tweet, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., sent out a image that said, ""7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected."" The percentage of Americans without health insurance is at its highest since 2014, and 7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected.We should be working to expand access to affordable #healthcare, not cut it off. pic.twitter.com/aRWCINCjm5 Cantwell’s tweet included the source -- Gallup’s National Health and Well-Being Index. However, her tweet didn’t mention that two widely respected federal studies show much less erosion in insurance coverage since Trump was elected in 2016. Let’s take a look at the numbers. In its National Health and Well-Being Index, the survey firm Gallup publishes quarterly data on how many Americans lack health insurance. To arrive at its numbers, the firm surveys approximately 10,000 U.S. adults aged 18 and older each month. Here’s a chart Gallup put together showing the historical trend for the uninsured rate in recent years:  In its release of its findings for the fourth quarter of 2018, Gallup wrote, ""Today's level is the highest in more than four years, and well above the low point of 10.9 percent reached in 2016. The 2.8-percentage-point increase since that low represents a net increase of about seven million adults without health insurance."" That parallels what Cantwell tweeted. However, Gallup’s data shows the most extreme rise in the uninsured rate; other data shows relatively little change. • The Census Bureau’s ""Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2017"" showed an increase of the uninsured of 492,000 people between 2017 and 2016. That’s a rise, but it’s about one-fourteenth as large as the one Cantwell cited. Here’s the historical trend line for the Census Bureau’s study:  • The National Health Interview Survey, undertaken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, actually found a decline of 300,000 uninsured Americans between 2016 and the first quarter of 2018, if you measure by ""uninsured at the time of interview,"" which is the closest comparison to Gallup’s data. If you instead use ""uninsured for at least part of the past year"" -- a different statistic the CDC’s survey collected -- there was essentially no change in the ranks of the uninsured over that period. Here are the long-term historical figures for the CDC study:  It’s worth noting that the various studies have some differences in methodology. ""Every survey that measures health insurance coverage and the uninsured comes out with somewhat different answers,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health-policy specialist at the Urban Institute. ""They all have different questions, different ordering of questions within the survey, different sample sizes, and different sampling frames."" For instance, the CDC survey doesn’t include adults over 65, whereas Gallup does. Perhaps the most important advantage for the Gallup data is that it includes the most current data of the three -- a factor that Bryan Watt, a spokesman for Cantwell, cited in an interview with PolitiFact Watt also pointed to another non-governmental survey, undertaken by the Commonwealth Fund, that shows an increase in the uninsured rate since 2016, a finding that’s consistent with what Gallup found. The Commonwealth Fund survey reported that the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults was 12.7 percent in February-April 2016, 14.0 percent in March-June 2017, and 15.5 percent in February-March 2018. Still, Blumberg said there are reasons to rely on the governmental studies, particularly the one published by the CDC. ""Gallup is more recent, but they also show larger changes than the NHIS in recent years,"" she said. The CDC study ""has a higher response rate, and it has been transparent as to whether any questions or data collection methodology has changed. Given the differences in the way these surveys are measuring changes in the number of uninsured, it’s probably best to acknowledge that and be careful not to draw conclusions too quickly,"" Blumberg said. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed. ""We will know more when the Census Bureau or the CDC put out updated estimates,"" she said. ""In the meantime, politicians should hold their fire."" Cantwell tweeted, ""7 million more Americans are uninsured now than when President Trump was elected."" The tweet cites one study of health insurance coverage, the one undertaken by Gallup. However, she ignores two closely watched government studies that showed much smaller changes in uninsured Americans, and in one instance, actually found a modest reduction in the number of people without insurance.

Wisconsin Democracy Campaign hits and misses with claims against National Rifle Association
","The National Rifle Association is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in American politics. First chartered in New York in 1871, the association’s initial stated goal was to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis."" Over the years, its focus expanded and eventually the group got political. Information on pending firearms-related legislation was included in the association's magazine, The American Rifleman; a Legislative Affairs Division was created in 1934. How does the NRA stack up against other lobbying groups today? Well, in January 2019, the Madison-based Wisconsin Democracy Campaign dubbed the NRA its ""Influence peddler of the month."" ""They (the NRA) are one of the biggest lobbyists here in the capital,"" said Matt Rothschild, the group’s executive director, in a Jan. 3, 2019 interview on WRRD 1510-AM’s ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a liberal talk radio program. ""They spend a ton of money during elections,"" he said. ""We just reported that they spent more than a million dollars here in Wisconsin on the 2018 elections. Most of that was for Walker, or more specifically against Evers."" The Democracy Campaign is a government watchdog group that tracks political contributions. Rothschild is referring, of course, to the election in which Democrat Tony Evers ousted Republican Gov. Scott Walker. But what about the many parts of his claim? Is he right? Looking at the claim When asked to back up Rothschild’s claim, Democracy Campaign researcher Michael Buelow pointed to the spending reports from the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, available on the webpage of the Wisconsin Campaign Finance Information System.  For our purposes, we are dividing the claim into four parts: The NRA is one of the biggest lobbyists in Madison According to a report from the Wisconsin Ethics Commission, titled ""Total Lobbying Expenditures Sorted by Total Dollars,"" the NRA spent $126,987 on lobbying for the period of January 2017 to June 2018 (the most recent data available online). That meant it ranked 109 out of 793 groups. But that is far from ""one of the biggest."" The top spender on lobbying, for instance, was Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, which spent more than $1 million in that period. So that part of the claim falls short. That the NRA is among the biggest spenders on Wisconsin elections Rothschild used the phrase ""a ton of money."" In our minds, that means it is one of the biggest spenders on the election According to a November 2018 news release by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign itself, here are the top 10 independent expenditure groups from the fall election: Americans for Prosperity -- $7.4 million Right Direction Wisconsin PAC (RGA Wisconsin) -- $6.5 million ACC Wisconsin PAC -- $4.3 million Wisconsin Freedom PAC -- $2.8 million Greater Wisconsin Political Independent Expenditure Fund -- $2.3 million DAGA WI People's Lawyer Project -- $2.1 million Wisconsin Conservation Voters Independent Expenditure Committee -- $1 million American Federation for Children Action Fund IE Committee Inc -- $971,133 NRA Political Victory Fund - Federal PAC -- $955,155 For Our Future -- $910,736 So the $955,155, puts the NRA at No. 9. But its tally is far below the $2.3 million that would put it in the Top 5, or the $7.4 million at the very top. So this part of the claim is off a bit as well. More than $1 million in spending in 2018 PolitiFact Wisconsin searched the Wisconsin Campaign Finance Information site 2018 entries for ""NRA Political Victory Fund -- Federal PAC"" and found the following: -- Spending against Evers: $872,915.46 -- Spending for Walker: $67,669.09 -- Spending for Michael Screnock (state Supreme Court candidate): $44,159.98 -- Spending for Brad Schimel (attorney general): $14,570.81 -- Spending for Andre Jacque (state Senate): $2,432.85 That is more than $1 million on elections in 2018, so that part of the claim hits the target. Most of the spending was for Walker or against Evers The final part of the claim also hits the mark -- of the more than $1 million total, $940,584 was either for Walker, or opposing Evers. Attempts to obtain comment from an NRA spokeswoman were unsuccessful. Our rating Rothschild said, the NRA is ""one of the biggest lobbyists here in the capital. They spend a ton of money during elections. … They spent more than a million dollars here in Wisconsin on the 2018 elections. Most of that was for Walker, or more specifically against Evers."" Our review of the numbers found a mixed bag. Rothschild overshot on how the NRA stacks up against other groups in Wisconsin, but he accurately described its spending in the most recent election.

RNC claims Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor said judges make policy
","
On the day President Barack Barack Obama announced Sonia Sotomayor as his Supreme Court nominee, many conservative opponents seized on a Sotomayor statement they say revealed her as someone who thinks judges make laws.
 
While Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele struck a measured pose — saying Republicans would ""reserve judgment on Sotomayor until there has been a thorough and thoughtful examination of her legal views"" — the RNC also sent around a talking points memo to the press and hundreds of influential Republicans that claimed ""Judge Sotomayor has also said that policy is made on the U.S. Court of Appeals.""
 
And Wendy E. Long, counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network, called Sotomayor a ""liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important than the law as written. She thinks that judges should dictate policy.""
 
The conservative blogosphere is full of similar sentiments, all based on the Sotomayor statement, ""The Court of Appeals is where policy is made.""
 
So we decided to take a look at the context of Sotomayor's statement. It came during a presentation at Duke University in February 2005. Sotomayor was one of three judges who participated in a panel discussion for law students thinking about applying to be judicial law clerks. Snippets of Sotomayor's comments have been popular on YouTube; see the full, unedited video

here

(the pertinent part starts around the 43-minute mark).
 
Sotomayor was asked about the differences between clerking for judges in the federal district courts as opposed to those in federal appeals court.
 
""The Court of Appeals is where policy is made,"" said Sotomayor, a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. ""And I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we don't make law. I know … I know. (some laughs) I'm not promoting it. I'm not advocating it. I'm … you know. Okay. (more laughs)
 
""Having said that, the Court of Appeals is where, before the Supreme Court makes the final decision, the law is percolating. It's interpretation. It's application.""
 
So keep in mind the audience and the question here, said Tom Goldstein, a partner at Washington law firm Akin Gump and the founder of ScotusBlog, a widely read blog on the Supreme Court. Goldstein watched the full video, and simply sees it as Sotomayor noting that in comparison to district court judges, ""there's more policy involved"" in the appeals courts.
 
""The truth of the matter is, in the court of appeals, they are dealing with gaps and ambiguities in the law,"" Goldstein said.


There's a lot for judges to interpret. Appeals court judges often have to make a call when a statute is unclear. In a sense, the policy is set by those calls made by the judges, even if they don't want to.
 
To use that one line from Sotomayor to paint her as an activist judge is misleading, he said.
 
""She's not a sweeping visionary ideologue in any way,"" Goldstein said. ""Conservatives who are genuinely concerned about the direction of the Supreme Court, they are sort of grasping at straws here. That's an awful lot to put on one sentence.""
 
David Garrow, a historian who follows the Supreme Court, agrees.
 
There has always been two schools of thought on the role of judges, Garrow said: those who see the law almost as an academic exercise, trying their best to mechanically apply the law; and the legal realists, who believe interpreting the law involves making choices, discretion.
 
""What she (Sotomayor) said there is simply the honest version of what any judge knows and realizes,"" Garrow said. But ""you're not really supposed to acknowledge it on the record.""
 
It's unfair to extrapolate that comment to suggest Sotomayor would mandate policy, he said.
 
""To anyone who knows the intellectual history of judicial decisionmaking, she's just being honest, not activist,"" Garrow said.
 
In short, the quote in question is the first line of a larger discussion about the differences between clerking for a district court rather than an appeals court judge. And Sotomayor goes on to detail those differences. In full context, it's clear that she is making the point that there are more decisions about interpreting and applying policy at the appeals court level. To the extent that the RNC raises the point to suggest it means she would be an activist judge on the Supreme Court, we think that's misleading. Sotomayor even noted that judges don't make law, that she was talking about interpreting and applying it. And so we rule the RNC's statement Half True.

Colin Powell overstates Bush-Cheney differences on closing Guantanamo
","
In a much anticipated interview on CBS's

Face the Nation

on May 24, 2009, former Secretary of State Colin Powell fired back at former Vice President Dick Cheney's public criticism of President Barack Obama's decision to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
 
In a speech on national defense on May 21, Cheney said Obama's announcement of his intent to close Gitmo ""came with little deliberation and no plan"" and might result in terrorists being brought to the United States.
 
""The administration has found that it's easy to receive applause in Europe for closing Guantanamo,"" Cheney said, ""but it's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and America's national security.""
 
Cheney has argued that Guantanamo needs to stay open.
 
""If you didn't have it, you'd have to invent it,"" Cheney said in a Fox News interview on May 12, 2009. ""It's a good facility, it's an important program, and we ought to continue it.""
 
But Powell said on

Face the Nation

that position runs counter to that of Cheney's old boss, President George W. Bush.
 
""Mr. Cheney is not only disagreeing with President Obama's policy,"" Powell said. ""He's disagreeing with President Bush's policy. President Bush stated repeatedly to international audiences and to the country that he wanted to close Guantanamo. The problem he had was he couldn't get all the pieces together.


""Secretary Rice, Secretary of State Rice and Secretary of Defense Gates had come forward with plans, but the plans ran into difficulties with Department of Justice and others.


""So it is a complex problem, and President Bush wasn't able to close Guantanamo on his watch. And President Obama came in saying he would close Guantanamo, and he has run into some of those same sorts of problems. So I think we need to kind of take the heat out of this issue.""
 
Powell is correct that several times during 2006 and 2007, President Bush publicly expressed his desire to close Gitmo.
 
Here are a few examples:
 
* ""I’d like to close Guantanamo. But I also recognize that we’re holding some people that are darned dangerous, and that we’d better have a plan to deal with them in our courts."" — Bush in a White House news conference on June 14, 2006
 
* ""I'd like to end Guantanamo. I'd like it to be over with."" But, he said, there are some ""cold-blooded killers"" who need to be tried in U.S. courts. The United States is ""not going to let people out on the street who will do you harm."" — Bush in a speech after talks with European Union leaders at a one-day summit in Vienna, June 21, 2006.
 
* ""I did say it should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantanamo. I also made it clear that part of the delay was the reluctance of some nations to take back some of the people being held there. In other words, in order to make it work, we've got to have a place for these people to go. ... We are working with other nations to send folks back. Again, it's a fairly steep order. A lot of people don't want killers in their midst, and a lot of these people are killers.


""Secondly, of course, we want to make sure that when we do send them back, they're treated as humanely as possible. The other issue was whether or not we can get people to be tried. One of the things I'm anxious about, want to see happen, is that there to be trials. Courts have been involved with deciding how to do this, and Defense is trying to work out mechanisms to get the trials up and running. And the sooner we can get that up and running, the better it is, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to make any predictions about whether Guantanamo will be available or not. I'm just telling you it's a very complicated subject.


""And I laid out an aspiration. Whether or not we can achieve that or not, we'll try to. But it is not as easy a subject as some may think on the surface."" — Bush in a news conference Aug. 9, 2007
 
So Bush had an ""aspiration"" to close Gitmo. But by the fall of 2008, the

New York Times

reported, Bush became resigned that ""closing Guantanamo would involve too many legal and political risks to be acceptable, now or any time soon,"" according to senior administration officials. And, obviously, it did not close.
 
Powell isn't entirely correct when he says Cheney is disagreeing with Bush's policy. Bush always qualified statements about his desire to close Gitmo with warnings that legal complications presented huge obstacles. And ultimately, Bush decided those complications meant that Gitmo remained necessary and had to remain open.
 
That's an awful lot like what Cheney has been saying. It's one thing to say you want to close Gitmo, Cheney said last week, ""but it's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and America's national security.""
 
So yes, Powell is right that Bush said he wanted to close Gitmo. But it's not as simple as Bush wanting to close Gitmo and Cheney wanting to keep it open. Because, in fact, Bush did leave it open. Bush said legal issues — and the fear of terrorists being brought to the United States — led him to keep the facility open. Again, that sounds like what Cheney has been saying. We rule Powell's statement Half True.

Dick Cheney claims Blair said high-value information came from controversial enhanced interrogation techniques
","
In a speech on national security, former Vice President Dick Cheney argued that despite all the controversy about the propriety of waterboarding and other ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques used on terror suspects in the wake of 9/11, one fact has been lost — the techniques worked. And Cheney cited comments from an appointee of President Barack Obama to back up his point.
 
""President Obama's own director of national intelligence, Admiral Blair, put it this way: 'High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided a deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country,' "" Cheney said in a May 21, 2009, speech at the American Enterprise Institute.
 
""Admiral Blair put that conclusion in writing, only to see it mysteriously deleted in a later version released by the administration, the missing 26 words that tell an inconvenient truth.""
 
Cheney is right about there being two different versions of an April 16 memo sent by Adm. Dennis C. Blair, President Obama’s director of national intelligence.
 
In a private version of the memo sent to his colleagues, Blair says it's important to remember the context of events that led to the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.
 
""All of us remember the horror of 9/11. For months afterwards we did not have a clear understanding of the enemy we were dealing with, and our every effort was focused on preventing further attacks that would kill more Americans. It was during these months that the CIA was struggling to obtain critical information from captured al-Qaida leaders, and requested permission to use harsher interrogation methods. ... High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country.""
 
That last sentence wasn't included in an abbreviated form of the memo that was released to the public. You can check out both versions

here

.
 
Here's another line that was cut: ""I like to think I would not have approved those methods in the past, but I do not fault those who made the decisions at that time.""
 
But the administration isn't the only one guilty of truncating Blair's full position.
 
Cheney failed to mention this statement released by Blair on April 21, ""I also strongly supported the president (Obama) when he declared that we would no longer use enhanced interrogation techniques. We do not need these techniques to keep America safe. The information gained from these techniques was valuable in some instances, but there is no way of knowing whether the same information could have been obtained through other means. The bottom line is these techniques have hurt our image around the world, the damage they have done to our interests far outweighed whatever benefit they gave us and they are not essential to our national security.""
 
So Cheney mentioned the quote from Blair that the enhanced interrogations provided ""high-value information,"" but failed to mention Blair's later clarification that while the techniques did provide information, there is no way of knowing if that information could have been obtained through other means.
 
Cheney also failed to mention that Blair opposes the use of the controversial interrogation techniques, that he thinks the damage they have caused far outweigh the benefits gained and that they ""are not essential to our national security.""
 
Cheney neglected to give a full account of Blair's comments. But even that additional context does not refute the core point that Cheney attributes to Blair. Even if Blair has misgivings about the techniques, he has still acknowledged the information from them ""was valuable in some instances."" We find Cheney's statement Mostly True.

Dick Cheney says only three terror suspects were ever waterboarded
","
President Barack Obama and former Vice President Dick Cheney squared off in dueling speeches on national security on May 21, 2009.
 
Not surprisingly, Cheney defended the controversial interrogation techniques used during the Bush administration on some terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks. And, he said, despite all the hand-wringing and public debate about waterboarding over the last couple years, the technique was used on only three detainees.
 
""You've heard endlessly about waterboarding,"" Cheney said in his address at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It happened to three terrorists. One of them was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, who has also boasted about his beheading of Daniel Pearl.
 
""We had a lot of blind spots after the attacks on our country, things we didn't know about al-Qaida. We didn't know about al-Qaida's plans, but Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and a few others did know.


""And with many thousands of innocent lives potentially in the balance, we did not think it made sense to let the terrorists answer questions in their own good time, if they answered them at all.""
 
Public records support his claim about the three detainees, who collectively were subjected to waterboarding at least 267 times.
 
The use of waterboarding — an interrogation technique that simulates drowning — was first publicly acknowledged by then-CIA director Michael Hayden during a Senate intelligence hearing on Feb. 5, 2008. He said it was used on three terror suspects in 2002 and 2003.
 
""Let me make it very clear and to state so officially in front of this committee that waterboarding has been used on only three detainees,"" Hayden said. ""It was used on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It was used on Abu Zubaydah. And it was used on (Abd al-Rahim al-)Nashiri. The CIA has not used waterboarding for almost five years.""
 
According to a memo released by the Attorney General's Office in April 2009, waterboarding was removed from CIA’s authorized list of techniques sometime after 2005.
 
Also in April 2009, the Justice Department released 2005 legal memos that detailed the use of the waterboarding technique in 2002 and 2003, including the revelation that it had been used 183 times against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-described planner of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Cheney is correct that during a military tribunal in 2007, Mohammed claimed responsibility for the murder of

Wall Street Journal

reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002.
 
The memos also noted that the CIA used waterboarding at least 83 times in August 2002 against Abu Zubaydah, described by the CIA as one of Osama bin Laden's key lieutenants.
 
And lastly, the technique was used on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged mastermind of the 2000 USS

Cole

bombing.
 
In all three cases, Hayden said, ""We used it against these three high-value detainees because of the circumstances of the time. Very critical to those circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were imminent.""
 
There has been no information publicly released that any other terror suspects have been subjected to waterboarding.
 
""We only know of those three being waterboarded,"" said Joanne Mariner, a counterterrorism expert with Human Rights Watch. ""That's all that's on the public record.""
 
In short, Cheney is on solid ground with this statistic. We rate his statement True.

No inmate has escaped from federal supermax prison
","
In a speech defending his plans for the detainess at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, President Barack Obama said Americans should not be concerned about them being transferred to the United States because federal prisons are secure.
 
""Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders — highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety,"" Obama said. ""Bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal '

supermax

' prisons.""
 
First, we should note that Obama's comment suggests there is more than one federal

""supermax

"" facility. But there's actually just one, the Administration Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Some states have built their own maximum security prisons, but it's clear Obama was referring to federal facilities because they would be the ones to house the suspected terrorists.
 
The security of the ""Alcatraz of the Rockies,"" as the Florence prison is known among correctional program professionals, has been cited frequently by Democrats as lawmakers and the administration battle over where to relocate the detainees. Obama is seeking to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010.
 
Many Republicans believe it should remain open, and many Democrats have also grown wary. A bipartisan group of lawmakers blocked funding to close the facility until Obama comes up with a more detailed plan on what would happen to the detainees.
 
Meanwhile, some Senate Democrats, including Assistant Majority Leader Richard

Durbin

and California Sen. Dianne

Feinstein

, have suggested that

a supermax

prison is the best place to house the suspected terrorists.


As you might expect, living is austere at the Alcatraz of the Rockies. Prisoners are kept in small cells and have limited contact with others. Florence is already home to several widely known international and domestic terrorists, including the ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid, and

Zacarias


Moussaoui

, a man sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks.
 
As for Obama's statement, federal prison officials confirmed that he is correct. No prisoner has ever escaped from the only federal

supermax

facility since it was opened in 1994, no doubt thanks to the $10 million perimeter fence and the remote-controlled steel doors. We find his statement True.

Bachmann claims ACORN has access to $8.5 billion in federal money
","
U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann's latest outrage focuses on an old nemesis: ACORN.
 
Not only are there new charges in two states related to fraudulent voter registration efforts by ACORN and its employees during the 2008 presidential election, she said, it now appears the group could tap into billions of dollars of federal money in the economic stimulus and the Obama administration's proposed 2010 budget.
 
In a May 6 news release, Bachmann sounded the alarm:
 
""At least $53 million in federal funds have gone to ACORN activists since 1994, and the controversial group could get up to $8.5 billion more tax dollars despite being under investigation for voter registration fraud in a dozen states. The economic stimulus bill enacted in February contains $3 billion that the nonprofit activist group known more formally as the Association for Community Organizations for Reform Now could receive, and 2010 federal budget contains another $5.5 billion that could also find its way into the group's coffers.""
 
She has since thrown these numbers out several times in interviews, including ones with Lou Dobbs on CNN and Glenn Beck on Fox.
 
In January, we addressed a piece of this when we fact-checked a claim from House Republican Leader John Boehner, who warned the economic stimulus package ""could open billions of taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups like the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)."" Boehner was referring to $2.2 billion in the stimulus package for ""neighborhood stabilization,"" essentially money doled out to groups to buy up abandoned and foreclosed homes, to rehabilitate them and then sell or rent them out. ACORN said it had no plans to apply for the funding, and if it did, the money would have to be used to buy and fix abandoned houses, not for voter registration efforts. We ruled that claim

Barely True

.
 
This latest claim from Bachmann follows the same tortured logic on an even grander scale.
 
A spokesman from Bachmann's office said the congresswoman got her data from a May 6, 2009,

Washington Examiner

commentary written by Kevin Mooney, who got the $8.5 billion figure from Matthew Vadum, a senior analyst and editor with Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank.
 
Let's first look at how they arrived at that number. It includes, of course, the same $2.2 billion that Boehner cited from the stimulus package. Vadum also adds $1 billion in the stimulus for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. ACORN could potentially tap into that, he said.
 
The remaining $5.5 billion comes from the Obama administration's proposed 2010 budget, specifically the budget for Housing and Urban Development. The budget plan includes $1 billion for an Affordable Housing Trust Fund, plus $4.5 billion more for CDBGs.
 
CDBGs have been around since 1974. Obama is seeking to increase the CDBG budget from about $3.6 billion in 2009 to $4.2 billion next year. And then there's the additional $1 billion for CDBGs in the stimulus. But the point is, this isn't some new pot of money that hasn't been available in years past. To the extent ACORN has been eligible for CDBG money for decades, it is available to ACORN now.
 
But the fact is, ACORN isn't eligible for CDBG funding. At least not for the controversial voter registration efforts that Republican leaders claim are a willful effort to forward the group's liberal agenda.
 
ACORN has a complex corporate structure. It's actually a network of affiliates. The ACORN that Republicans love to hate gets involved in political activity like voter registration. But there are other entities, like the sister company, ACORN Housing Corporation, a nonprofit that provides free housing counseling to low and moderate income homebuyers. Some of the ACORN Housing affiliates have also dabbled in affordable housing projects and have received federal funding. But ACORN Housing doesn't get involved in voter registration activities.
 
CDBG money is given to local governments and states to use as they see fit for community development projects. But there are strings attached. CDBG rules list eligible uses of the money, including such things as building sidewalks, sewers and affordable housing, mostly. Specifically ineligible: ""political activities."" In other words, ACORN can't use the money for voter registration.
 
According to the

Washington Examiner

's report, ACORN and its affiliates have received $53 million from the federal government since 1994. Most of that federal money went to the ACORN Housing Corporation, which by law could not be used for voter registration.
 
We checked, and there is no money in the stimulus package or the budget for voter registration programs.
 
So if ACORN Housing was to apply for and receive CDBG money, it would be for a very specific project. And legally, it could not be transferred to other ACORN affiliates to perform political activities like voter registration.
 
But some ACORN opponents allege that's exactly what would happen.
 
""ACORN is constantly shifting funding,"" Vadum said. If ACORN Housing were to get federal funding, ""we don't know where it would go. The problem is that ACORN transfers vast sums of money around in its network all the time. We don't know whether the money would be spent on voter registration or other activities.""
 
According to a July 2002 report from the Employment Policies Institute called ""Rotten ACORN, America's Bad Seed,"" tax forms show that since 1997, the ACORN Housing Corporation has paid more than $5 million in fees or grants to other ACORN entities. The report does not claim, however, that federal tax dollars were shifted into ACORN voter registration efforts.
 
Asked what funds ACORN Housing has transferred to other ACORN affiliates, Vadum said ACORN Housing has paid over $1.5 million to Citizens Consulting Inc., which he describes as ""the shadowy part of the ACORN network where money seems to disappear into.""
 
That's absurd, said ACORN executive director Steven Kest. Citizens Consulting Inc. is the accounting arm of the ACORN organization. CCI handles bookkeeping, payroll accounting and other financial management services for ACORN and its many affiliates. And ACORN Housing doesn't even use CCI anymore, as it now does its accounting in-house, Kest said.
 
Bottom line, we don't see any evidence that ACORN Housing has transferred money to ACORN for voter registration, so we think it's incorrect for Bachmann to link federal money that ACORN Housing might receive with the more controversial voter registration activities performed by sister organization ACORN.
 
Even more ridiculous is the suggestion that ACORN or any of its affiliates might actually

get

$8.5 billion in federal tax dollars.
 
Vadum said his report has been misrepresented by many on that point.
 
""The key word here is eligible,"" Vadum said. ""Eligible is a pretty expansive word. I made it clear they are not going to get that full amount.""
 
Yes, he made that point in the

Washington Examiner.

But when Bachmann says ACORN could get that amount, it assumes the group would get every single dime in the stimulus for fixing up abandoned homes. And remember, they said they don't even have plans to apply for any of it.
 
""We think it's a great program,"" Kest said. ""But that's not money we are applying for.""
 
And they'd also need to get every single dollar allocated through the CDBG program. That's beyond preposterous. Those grants are allocated to thousands of organizations around the country to perform very specific community development projects.
 
""These are competitive grants for very specific projects,"" Kest said.""The money can only be used for the project you bid for. It can't go to voter registration. If you've ever had any experience with grant funding from the federal government, they do a good job of making sure the money is used for the purposes it was intended. You can't use the money for any other reason. You can't transfer the money to other vehicles for other purposes.""
 
Charges of voter registration fraud by members of ACORN during the 2008 elections are a serious matter. Investigators allege ACORN employees tried to fraudulently register thousands of ineligible voters. Among them, one Mickey Mouse.
 
But Bachmann's statement is irresponsibly misleading on several levels. She says the group under indictment for voter registration fraud could tap into billions of federal dollars. In fact, none of the federal money can be used for voter registration activities.
 
An affiliate like ACORN Housing could conceivably apply for a grant to build an affordable housing project, or to buy, fix and sell abandoned homes, but that's exactly what the money would have to be used for. Suggestions that one of the affiliates might funnel money to ACORN for political activity is, so far, unsubstantiated conjecture. And then there's the matter of trying to make a splash by throwing out the massive $8.5 billion number, suggesting ACORN ""could get"" it, as in all of it. That's absurd. We rule Bachmann's statement False.

Durbin correct that convicted terrorists are in federal prisons
","
Republicans have been complaining for several weeks that President Barack Obama's plan to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would force the government to bring dangerous terrorists to prisons in the United States. They've even introduced a bill that would put restrictions on the transfers called the ""Keep Terrorists Out of America Act.""
 
In response to the criticism, Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the assistant majority leader, declared on the Senate floor May 20, 2009, ""The reality is, we are holding some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world right now in our federal prisons, including the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 'shoe bomber,' the 'Unabomber,' and many others.""
 
We started by doing a little digging at the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Indeed, Richard Reid — a.k.a. the ""shoe bomber"" — is being held at the Administration Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., which, according to the bureau's Web site, ""houses offenders requiring the tightest controls."" It is the only one of its kind in the United States.


The Florence facility houses several other people that Durbin mentioned and characterized as terrorists: Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the ""mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,"" and Ted Kaczynski, the ""Unabomber"" who killed three people and injured 28 others in a string of bombings over the span of 18 years. So Durbin is right about them.
 
Others convicted of terrorist crimes are housed in the same federal prison, including Wadih El-Hage, Osama bin Laden's former secretary, and Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted for his role in the 9/11 attacks.
 
All told, the federal prisons hold 347 people convicted of international or domestic terrorism, according to Durbin's office, citing Federal Bureau of Prisons statistics.
 
The Florence location is where the most violent prisoners — and those most likely to escape — end up. Living conditions are sparse; inmates are housed in 86-square-foot cells and have limited contact with other people.
 
Democrats such as Durbin say facilities like the one in Florence are well-suited for detainees from Guantanamo Bay.
 
""Some of my Republican colleagues argued that Guantanamo is the only appropriate place to hold the detainees because 'we don’t have a facility that could handle this in the United States' and American corrections officers would 'have no idea what they are getting into,'"" Durbin said. ""They ought to take a look at some of our secured facilities in the United States and they ought to have a little more respect for the men and women who are corrections officers.""


As for Durbin's claim, it appears he did his homework. Given that all the terrorists he named in his statement are in fact held in the United States, we find his statement True.

Some private health insurance can survive public option
","
With high-profile support from President Barack Obama, Congress is preparing a major overhaul of the nation's health care system. The details have yet to be revealed, but that hasn't stopped critics in Congress from going on the attack.
 
Obama and the Democratic leadership have proposed broad outlines for the overhaul. The centerpiece of their plan remains the employer-based system, where most people have private health insurance through work. To rein in costs, the government would invest in electronic medical records and encourage efficiency and preventive care.
 
To get coverage for people who don't have health insurance, the plan would increase eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. Finally, the plans seek to create a health insurance exchange, where individuals and small businesses can easily comparison shop for insurance coverage. One of the exchange plans would be a public option run by the government. 
 
It's the public option that has fueled Republican attacks. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on

Fox News Sunday

that a public option would destroy the private insurance system.
 
It ""would mean a government plan that would inevitably put the government between you and your doctor, and there would be no more private insurance,"" McConnell said.
 
Asked why by interviewer Chris Wallace, McConnell said, ""Because the private insurance people will not be able to compete with a government option.""
 
McConnell is incorrect — the Democratic plan does not intend to do away with private insurance. His statement that private insurance ""will not be able to compete with a government option"" is challenged by nonpartisan health care experts who disagree.
 
McConnell's view is that if the government offers a cheaper, public plan, people will dump their private insurance to get lower health care premiums. Over time, this would errode the private health care system. In theory, it makes sense that people would want the health plan that saves them the most money, and experts do say some private insurance companies might struggle to survive against a government competitor. In practice, however, researchers don't believe public options would destroy the private insurance industry.
 
""Every time I hear these claims I'm astonished,"" said Cathy Schoen, senior vice president for the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that studies health care and advocates more coverage for the uninsured, minorities and people with low incomes. She said a public plan could pressure private insurers to lower premiums or negotiate better rates with hospitals, but it would not put private companies out of business.
 
""The public plan could get a reputation of not being good. The private plans could say, 'Let's change our behavior so we don't lose business,'"" Schoen said.
 
Another nonpartisan research group, the Urban Institute, reached similar conclusions.
 
""Private plans would not disappear. Private plans that offer better services and greater access to providers, even at somewhat higher costs than the public plans, would survive the competition in this environment,"" wrote John Holahan and Linda Blumberg of the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center.
 
One of the problems right now is that private insurance is not as competitive as you might think. Both the Commonwealth Fund and the Urban Insitute have noted that most health care markets are dominated by a small number of big insurers.
 
""The increased concentration has made it difficult for the nation to reap the benefits usually associated with competitive markets,"" Holahan and Blumberg wrote.
 
Not that a public option will solve all problems. They concluded that a public plan is not sufficient to control growing health care costs, and that other cost-containment strategies would be necessary.
 
Finally, we should point out that it remains to be seen how the Democratic plan will deal with the public option, which could be structured in several different ways.
 
McConnell flatly states that the public option would run private plans out business because they ""will not be able to compete with a government option."" Even though we have limited details on how the plan would be implemented, there is enough in the administration proposal  to conclude that McConnell's worst-case scenario is unlikely. That brings us to Barely True.

Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana described the Democratic health care plan as ""a government-controlled health care plan that will deprive roughly 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage and lead to federal bureaucrats denying critical care for patients."" That ""120 million"" number jumped out at us. That's a big number, representing roughly three-quarters of those who now have employer-provided health insurance. We asked Pence's staff about the number, and they referred us to a report from the Lewin Group, a health care consulting firm. The report ran a number of scenarios, including what would happen if the government offered a public option that was a Medicare-style plan open to everyone. Their model found that 118 million people would choose to drop their private coverage in favor of cheaper public coverage. But there's a hitch: That's what the Lewin Group believed would happen under the plans that were the most like Medicare, and if everyone were allowed to enroll. As we noted before, it's possible to set up a public option where only some people are allowed to enroll. Under the Lewin Group's estimates, if you restrict a Medicare-style public option only to individuals and small businesses, only 32 million would leave private coverage. And if the public option is less like Medicare and competes like a private insurer, the number drops further. We'll grant that Congress could come up with a Medicare-style plan and open it to everyone, but it doesn't seem likely. Pence appears to be picking the worst number he can choose. And he doesn't mention the fact that under the scenario laid out by the Lewin Group, people would still have health care coverage and their premiums reduced by 30 to 40 percent. He says the government would ""deprive"" people of health insurance, when actually the scenario is that they would choose a different option. Even if you believe that an expansive government health care plan would drive private insurers out of business, that still doesn't account for Pence's ""deprive"" claim, because the Lewin report he cites is focused on people who have chosen the government plan, not people who were left to the government plan after private options disappeared. Finally, we have to include a caveat about the Lewin Group. The group says it operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, which also offers private health insurance. Given all this background and explanation, we rated Pence's statement that the government would ""deprive"" 120 million people of their ""current health care coverage"" False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d3dff281-ba69-4fa7-b09c-de38ed52a748",/factchecks/2009/may/19/mike-pence/120-million-deprived-health-care-not-correct/

Democrats still pondering how to pay for healthcare
","
With high-profile support from President Barack Obama, Congress is preparing a major overhaul of the nation's health care system. The details have yet to be revealed, but that hasn't stopped critics in Congress from going on the attack.
 
Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri said Democrats haven't come up with a way to pay for their ambitious health plan.
 
""We agree that reform is needed, but Democrats have failed to answer the most basic question of how they want to pay for the more than $1 trillion of health care spending they’re advocating,"" Blunt said.
 
It's not clear how much the health care plan will cost. During the presidential campaign, Obama estimated his plan could cost $50 billion to $65 billion a year. That could come to $1 trillion over about 15 to 20 years. But independent sources that favor a health care overhaul put the expense much higher, at about $150 billion a year. That comes to $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
 
Blunt says that ""Democrats have failed to answer the most basic question"" of how they want to pay for health care. But Obama has put forward some relatively concrete proposals. His current budget includes a $635 billion fund for health care that includes savings from greater efficiencies and changing the tax code so the wealthy don't get as much in deductions. It's not clear if Congress will go along with the tax changes, though, and analysts have questioned whether the savings will be as great as Obama says.
 
Democrats in Congress are still debating how they want to pay for health care. Sen. Max Baucus of Montana of held a hearing on May 12, 2009, to discuss ways of financing health care, and senators during the hearing expressed a great deal of skepticism about new taxation strategies. After Blunt made his comments, Baucus put forward a policy paper that included several ways to potentially pay for health care, including modifying tax exemptions on employer-provided insurance and taxing alcohol and soda.
 
Len Berman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who testified during the hearing, said later Congress seems unsure how it will pay for health care. He wrote in a blog post that they seemed to be in the grip of ""magical thinking.""
 
""If there was the easy answer they'd have figured it out already,"" Berman told PolitiFact. ""The idea of a new federal tax terrifies legislators. ... If they're serious, and it's not going to be smoke and mirrors, then they're going to have to make decisions that they haven't been willing to make so far.""
 
So Blunt is largely correct that that Democrats ""have failed to answer"" how to pay for health care. But they are putting forward ideas, and the Obama administration has identified $635 billion — perhaps optimistically — to get a plan started. So we rate Blunt's statement Mostly True.

Bibles sent to soldier in Afghanistan for local distribution were confiscated and destroyed
","
A video that shows a U.S. soldier at the Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan talking about distributing Bibles to local residents as gifts stirred a great deal of controversy when shown recently as part of a news report by the Arab network Al Jazeera.
 
It rankled a number of Afghan officials in this deeply conservative Islamic community where many already view U.S. forces as Christian crusaders.
 
But it also irked some evangelical Christians in the United States who thought the U.S. military's response unfairly stepped on the religious rights of a Christian soldier. Of particular concern was the fate of the Bibles.
 
Gordon James Klingenschmitt of the Pray in Jesus' Name Project, a former U.S. Navy chaplain, took out an advertisement in

Human Events

, a conservative publication, with the headline, ""BREAKING NEWS: Pentagon Burns Soldiers Bibles - Military Chaplains Attacked.""
 
The story begins, ""The Pentagon under the Obama administration has just acknowledged seizing and burning the privately owned Bibles of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan.""
 
Although the story contains several claims, this is the main one, and the one we are fact-checking here.
 
So let's back up to the beginning.
 
The video in question, shot a year ago by an independent filmmaker, shows a small group of uniformed U.S. soldiers at a prayer service on the base in Bagram. A soldier explains that his local church in the United States collected money and sent him a package of Bibles (which are seen stacked on the floor) printed in the country's main Pashto and Dari languages. The base chaplain quickly notes in the video that the U.S. military policy, U.S. Central Command's General Order No. 1, specifically prohibits active duty troops from ""proselytizing any religion, faith, or practice."" The soldier then mentions the possibility of distributing the Bibles to locals as gifts.
 
A year later, the video became the centerpiece of a controversial May 4, 2009, story on Al Jazeera that questioned whether some U.S. military had crossed the line into evangelism and proselytizing.
 
The U.S. military claimed the story was misleading.
 
The full edit of the video, said U.S. Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col. Mark Wright, would have shown the chaplain explaining to the soldier that passing out the Bibles to locals was forbidden.
 
""Of course that violates General Order No.1,"" Wright said.
 
Trying to convert Muslims to another faith is a crime in Afghanistan.
 
So there's the significant matter of the soldier's safety, Wright said. It's also what the military calls a ""force protection threat.""
 
""There is a very real possibility it could cause a violent backlash,"" Wright explained.
 
Many in Afghanistan might perceive a soldier handing out Bibles as an organized effort of the U.S. military to try to convert them to Christianity, which would deeply offend the local Muslim people, he said. ""It would be a threat to our soldiers and service members' lives. That's the most important reason why proselytizing is forbidden. It's simply too dangerous to our forces.""
 
Wright said the Bibles were confiscated and thrown away. And every day, as a matter of course, the garbage on the base is burned. So that's what became of the Bibles. Any impression that there was some sort of formal book-burning is false, he said.
 
Only one copy got out of the room, he said, one given to the independent film crew.
 
""Not one of the Bibles made it off base,"" Wright said.
 
Asked about the Al Jazeera report in a May 4 Pentagon briefing, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Navy Adm. Mike Mullen said, ""It certainly is — from the United States military's perspective — not our position to ever push any specific kind of religion. Period.""
 
In his advertisement, Klingenschmitt claimed that statement appeared to ""defend the destruction of the soldiers' privately owned Bibles. ... He did not address the possibility that by seizing and burning privately owned Bibles, the Obama administration is now enforcing state atheism upon our troops.""
 
We find that last suggestion absurd. Nothing about this episode can be equated to ""enforcing"" atheism upon our troops. Soldiers are free to practice their religion of choice. And while privately owned, we think it's a stretch to suggest the Bibles were for American troops. They were written in Pashto and Dari languages. And the soldier who received them talked about giving them out in Afghanistan as gifts.
 
But again, we are fact-checking the statement, ""The Pentagon under the Obama administration has just acknowledged seizing and burning the privately owned Bibles of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan.""
 
The Pentagon under the Obama administration did ""just acknowledge"" that the Bibles were confiscated. But it's important to note that the prayer meeting video was shot a year ago, and so the Bibles were confiscated and destroyed under the Bush administration. The clear implication of this advertisement is that soldiers aren't allowed to have their own Bibles, but that's not true. The incident in question involved one soldier, not soldiers. The only real issue is when a soldier intends to use his or her Bible to evangalize about Christianity to the local population, a practice that violates a military policy unrelated to who is president. While much of this sentence is technically correct, it clearly is intended to distort. We rate it Half True.

Gov. Sanford cites Bloomberg statistic that the U.S. has ""spent, lent or committed"" nearly $13 trillion to blunt the recession
","South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford has been highly critical of the Obama administration for spending too much on the economic stimulus. Recently, Sanford cited a statistic compiled by the Bloomberg news service that ""our government has now 'spent, lent, or committed' $12.8 trillion in its attempt to blunt the recession."" It's a figure Sanford used in a commentary for  Human Events  , a conservative publication, and again in a letter to the editor of the  State Journal-Register  in Springfield, Ill. It is taken from a March 31, 2009, Bloomberg story that begins, ""The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have spent, lent or committed $12.8 trillion, an amount that approaches the value of everything produced in the country last year, to stem the longest recession since the 1930s."" At the bottom of the story is a chart breaking down how the number was derived. The lion's share — $7.7 trillion — comes from money lent or committed by the Federal Reserve for such things as credit discounts, debt purchases and bailouts of several financial institutions. Another $2 trillion relates to the FDIC, including liquidity guarantees and the purchase of risky bank assets. And lastly is the money the federal government is spending through the two stimulus packages (the $168 billion stimulus under President George W. Bush and the $787 billion stimulus under President Barack Obama), as well as the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, used to buy toxic assets, the mortgage-backed investments that triggered the nation's financial crisis. Economists caution that the government is not necessarily ""out"" all of that money. In the case of TARP money, for example, ""the estimates are that we will get most of the money back,"" said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And in the case of collateral extended to the Federal Reserve and FDIC, ""that's basically pledging to back up the operations of those organizations. We're pledging this money as collateral for that organization."" It doesn't mean the money will ever be spent. And in the case of things like auto company bailouts, for example, the federal government got company stock and it's too early to know how much the government will get back on that. But presumably some. ""At the end of the day, a large portion of that won't end up getting spent,"" Horney said. We had initially set out to fact-check Sanford for comment he made in a May 13, 2009, Fox Business Network interview when he said, ""This stimulus package, this federal effort ... at some point you know we spent about 20 percent of world GDP on this thing. You look at about $13 trillion last year and it's almost like you know Soviet-era grain quotas are saying you will produce this amount of grain in Kazakhstan, never mind the realities of what is going on, on the ground."" He's right that $13 trillion represents about 20 percent of the world GDP, but he left out the all-important qualifiers for the $13 trillion number, that it is money ""spent, lent or committed,"" instead characterizing all of it as money the federal government ""spent."" Economists hopped all over him for that one. ""If you are talking about an FDIC line of credit, there's a huge difference between that and spending X amount of dollars,"" Horney said. ""Calling it spending is just wrong."" The comment even drew rebuke from the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Saying $13 trillion has been spent is definitely misleading,"" said Alan Viard, a resident scholar at AEI. ""It's not fair to combine all that with the word 'spent.'""   The actual amount spent by the federal government to slow the recession is closer to $2 trillion, he said. Sanford spokesman Joel Sawyer acknowledged that Sanford left out the ""spent, lent or committed"" qualifiers in the Fox interview. In TV interviews, he said via e-mail, ""questions come fast and furious and it's easy to leave out some words."" But, he said, it'd be unfair to judge Sanford on that lone response when he had twice cited the statistic correctly, in writing. We agree, although we'll be watching carefully to make sure Sanford includes the proper caveats. Economists may disagree with this $13 trillion figure. There are many ways to calculate the amount the United States has pledged to stem the recession. But we think the Bloomberg calculation is one legitimate way. And we think it was certainly fair for Sanford to cite it, so long as he includes those all-important qualifiers. And on two occasions at least, he did. So we rate his comment True.",/factchecks/2009/may/15/mark-sanford/gov-sanford-cites-bloomberg-statistic-us-has-spent/

Rep. Steve King claims federal Hate Crime law would provide special protection to pedophiles and other sexual deviants
","
With the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act moving swiftly through Congress, and President Barack Obama committed to sign it, opponents have ratcheted up their rhetoric and complained about a provision that would add ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity"" to the list of hate crime categories.
 
In a Fox News interview on May 6, 2009, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said the ""sexual orientation"" wording would provide ""special protection to pedophiles.""
 
""The definition for sexual orientation was defined by one of the principal authors, Tammy Baldwin of Madison, Wisconsin, as being either heterosexual or homosexual. Well, so within that definition, though, of sexual orientation by the American Psychological Association you've got a whole list of proclivities — they call them paraphilias — and in that list, among them are pedophiles.
 
""And so I don't want special protective status for a pedophile when a regular person would get less — lesser protection under this law. ... This sets up sacred cows in this legislation. So some people are protected more than others in this society.""
 
King was so concerned about that possibility that he sought to amend the bill to specifically exclude pedophiles.
 
On the House floor on April 29, 2009, King argued that the lack of a definition of ""sexual orientation"" in the law would open the door to special protections for people with all kinds of deviant sexual proclivities.


""My amendment does not specifically define sexual orientation, although I've tried to do that,"" King said. ""But what it does do is say it doesn't include pedophiles because I think the intent of this committee is clearly that we don't want to provide a, let's just say, a sexual — a special protected status for pedophiles. There are others that I would put in that list as well, but this is the one that stands out to me that should be beyond question that this committee should be able to take a look at this amendment and conclude that whatever we might think about proclivities, pedophiles is not one that should be included.""
 
Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, went one step further, suggesting that victims of sex crimes could be guilty of a hate crime if they tried to defend themselves or retaliate against an attacker.
 
""If a mother hears that their child has been raped and she slaps the assailant with her purse, she is now gone after as a hate criminal because this is a protected class. There are other protected classes in here. I mean, simple exhibitionism — I have female friends who have told me over the years that some guy flashed them and their immediate reaction was to hit them with the purse. Well, now, he's committed a misdemeanor. She has committed a federal hate crime because the exhibitionism is protected under sexual orientation,"" Gohmert said.


""The plain meaning of sexual orientation is anything to which someone is sexually oriented. That could include exhibitionism. It can include necrophilia. It could include ... voyeurism. You see somebody spying on you changing clothes and you hit them, they've committed a misdemeanor. You've committed a federal felony under this bill.""
 
Their arguments gained a wider audience through postings on the conservative Web site RightMarch.com, which were e-mailed to subscribers of the conservative publication

Human Events

. The King amendment failed. Opponents said it was unnecessary, that pedophilia was not covered under the definition of sexual orientation. And the Hate Crime Prevention Act passed the House 249-175. A similar bill is pending in the Senate.
 
Many legal scholars we spoke with said King and Gohmert were wrong that pedophiles and other sexual deviants would get special protections from the bill. And supporters of the bill were more blunt, saying the arguments were ridiculous scare tactics.
 
The opponents' arguments display a fundamental misunderstanding of the words ""sexual orientation,"" said Arthur Leonard, a professor of law at New York Law School and an expert in gay rights and discrimination based on sexual orientation.


""Pedophilia and sexual orientation are two different things,"" Leonard said. Sexual orientation, he said, relates to the gender to which a person is romantically attracted while pedophilia relates to age, adults who are sexually fixated on children.
 
Leonard believes it is an attempt by legislators to appeal to their constituents' ""yahoo mentality.""
 
James Jacobs, an adjunct professor of law at New York University Law School, has been an outspoken critic of hate crime laws. He thinks they are unnecessary, amount to ""recriminalizing activities that are already criminal"" and are the product of political grandstanding.


But even he doesn't buy King's arguments about pedophilia.


""I don't think pedophilia would count as sexual orientation,"" Jacobs said. ""It's not a very persuasive argument.""
 
We went to

Black's Law Dictionary

, which defines sexual orientation this way: ""A person's predisposition or inclination toward a particular type of sexual activity or behavior; heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality.""
 
That first part seems to lend some weight to King's argument.
 
But that ignores the working definition used by the federal government for years, said Michael Lieberman, Washington counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, which has fought for the federal legislation for years.
 
The FBI's Hate Crime Data Collection Guidelines, prepared in response to the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act, defines ""sexual orientation bias"" as ""a preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons based on their sexual attraction toward, and responsiveness to, members of their own sex or members of the opposite sex, e.g., gays, lesbians, heterosexuals.""
 
Furthermore, Lieberman said, it ignores decades of history with state hate crime laws. There are currently 31 states that have hate crime laws that include sexual orientation.
 
""There are no cases, zero, at the federal or state level that even remotely resemble what Rep. King and other opponents have talked about,"" Lieberman said. ""It's make-believe.""
 
""It's laughable,"" said Jack Levin, professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University and co-chair of the Center on Violence and Conflict. ""Why should it happen at the federal level when it hasn't happened at the state level. They are setting up a straw man. ... It's a convenient way of arousing public fear about something that is quite benign.""
 
Said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino: ""The assertion that the law is designed in an effort to protect pedophiles is not only without merit, it is an affront to anyone who has been a victim of a hate crime. I think it's a bigoted a scare tactic designed to further denigrate gay and lesbian Americans. I'm disgusted that this has become a part of the debate.""
 
So we've found nothing to support the opponents' claims that pedophiles would be protected by the hate crimes bill. The experience of 31 states that have similar laws, the FBI's definition of sexual orientation and the opinions of legal experts have persuaded us not only that the opponents are wrong, but that their arguments are preposterous. We find King's claim to be Pants on Fire.

Obama reverses on release of abuse photos
","
President Barack Obama announced his administration was reversing course about the release of photographs depicting the abuse of foreign prisoners. We're rating this the first Full Flop of the Obama presidency.
 
The matter involves serious issues of national security, government openess and the treatment of foreign prisoners, and it began years ago during the Bush administration.
 
In 2003, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding the release of documents and photographs related to detainees being held overseas by the United States. When the Bush administration refused to release the information, the ACLU filed suit in federal court.
 
The lawsuit has been plodding along ever since. It was one of the key factors for Obama's decision to release memos from the Bush administration that provided a legal justification for harsh interrogation methods that included waterboarding.
 
The memos were released April 16, 2009. About a week later, the administration announced it intended to release photos depicting prisoner abuse as well.
 
""The 2nd Circuit Court ruled in December of 2008 that the photos had to be released,"" said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on April 24. ""The previous administration lost a court case on that. The Department of Justice decided based on the ruling that it was hopeless to appeal, and a mandate ordering the release of those photos came Monday. And the administration, the Pentagon, and the court entered into an agreement to release those photos.
 
""So this is part of the very same case that (Office of Legal Counsel) memos were derived from. This was a court case based on information that was compelled to be released.""
 
But during the next two weeks, the Obama administration reversed course. On May 13, Gibbs said the administration would not release the photos and would appeal any rulings requiring it to do so.
 
""The president does not believe that the strongest case regarding the release of these photos was presented to the court, and that was a case based on his concern of what the release of these would do to our national security,"" Gibbs said. ""He believes that the release of these photos could pose a threat to the men and women we have in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, and doesn't believe that the government made the strongest case possible to the court and asked the legal team to go make that case.""
 
When pressed about the reversal, Gibbs implied that timing was an issue. ""The argument that the president seeks to make is one that hasn't been made before. I'm not going to get into blame for this or that, understanding that there was significant legal momentum in these cases prior to the president entering into office,"" Gibbs said.
 
Obama appeared later that day to make a statement on the decision.
 
He said the photos were from investigations that had been completed prior to his taking office.
 
""In other words, this is not a situation in which the Pentagon has concealed or sought to justify inappropriate action,"" Obama said. ""Rather, it has gone through the appropriate and regular processes. And the individuals who were involved have been identified, and appropriate actions have been taken.
 
""It's therefore my belief that the publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals. In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them, I believe, would be to further inflame anti-American opinion and to put our troops in greater danger. Moreover, I fear the publication of these photos may only have a chilling effect on future investigations of detainee abuse.""
 
Obama also said that the abuse of detainees in custody is prohibited.
 
""Any abuse of detainees is unacceptable. It is against our values. It endangers our security. It will not be tolerated,"" he concluded.
 
The ACLU sharply criticized Obama's reversal.
 
""The Obama administration's adoption of the stonewalling tactics and opaque policies of the Bush administration flies in the face of the president's stated desire to restore the rule of law, to revive our moral standing in the world and to lead a transparent government,"" said executive director Anthony Romero in a written statement. ""If the Obama administration continues down this path, it will betray not only its promises to the American people, but its commitment to this nation's most fundamental principles.""
 
Congressional hawks such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with the Democrats, had urged Obama not to release the photos on the grounds that it would stoke recruitment among terrorist groups overseas. House Republican Leader John Boehner praised Obama's decision, saying, “Making these images public would only serve to embolden our enemies and increase the danger for our troops.""
 
Some will argue that Obama's reversal is a prudent course correction, while others will say it undermines his stated values of transparency. We're not taking a position on what the reversal means, but we are noting it as a complete reversal, the first one we've documented for Obama. We rate his change on the photo release a Full Flop.

Gingrich wrong on Democrats and waterboarding
","
Under pressure of a lawsuit, the Obama administration recently released memos on the interrogation of terror suspects during the Bush administration. The memos detailed techniques that included waterboarding, a simulated drowning maneuver widely considered to be torture.
 
Some torture opponents have called for the prosecution of Bush administration officials. Republicans, meanwhile, are firing back at Democrats in Congress, saying that they implicitly condoned the actions.
 
Democrats ""had control since January of 2007,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in a television interview. ""They haven't passed a law making waterboarding illegal. They haven't gone into any of these things and changed law.""
 
There is a grain of truth in his claim, but he conveniently ignores the actions of the Democratic Congress.
 
Democrats

did

pass legislation in 2008 that would have had the effect of outlawing waterboarding by restricting U.S. agents to interrogation methods outlined in the Army Field Manual. The manual specifically forbids waterboarding.
 
But President George W. Bush vetoed the bill and Democrats were not able to muster the two-thirds majority necessary to override the veto.
 
This was a big issue during the 2008 presidential campaign, because Sen. John McCain opposed the bill, even though he had said waterboarding is torture. At the time, McCain said he wasn't comfortable restricting intelligence personnel to the Army Field Manual.
 
It's worth noting that some elected officials do not believe that Congress needed to pass a law saying that waterboarding was illegal.  McCain, for example, said in 2007 that waterboarding already was illegal. ""It's in violation of the Geneva Conventions. It's in violation of existing law,"" he said at a debate in St. Petersburg. After the Bush administration memos were released, McCain said the legal reasoning behind them was ""deeply flawed,"" though he did not call for prosecutions.
 
So Democrats

did

try to change laws to end waterboarding after gaining control of Congress and initially passed the law. But they were stopped by a presidential veto. So Gingrich's statement that they ""
haven't passed a law making waterboarding illegal. They haven't gone into any of these things and changed law,"" is only true because of the veto. The Democrats certainly tried to pass a law that would have had the effect of outlawing waterboarding. We rate his statement Barely True.

Miss USA runner-up Carrie Prejean's comments on same-sex marriage mirror Obama's
","
It's not often that we can check a Miss USA contestant with our Truth-O-Meter. So when Miss California USA Carrie Prejean, the runner-up in the Miss USA competition, likened her much-discussed, pageant-night response to a question about gay marriage to President Barack Obama's beliefs, we decided it was time.
 
The similarity of the statements made by Miss California and Obama was raised during a May 12 news conference in which pageant owner Donald Trump announced that Prejean could retain her crown as Miss California USA even though she failed to reveal she had posed in her underwear as a teenager. The Donald also came to Prejean's defense about her gay marriage comments.
 
""It's the same answer that the president of the United States gave,"" Trump said. ""She gave an honorable answer. She gave an answer from her heart.""
 
Said Prejean: ""I was given a question asking for my opinion and I stated my honest belief. Not only do I hold this belief but, as Mr. Trump said, the president of the United States, the secretary of state and many Americans agree with me in this belief.""
 
Let's roll the tape on Prejean's statement during the Miss USA competition on April 19, 2009.
 
One of the celebrity judges, Perez Hilton, asked whether other states should follow Vermont's lead in legalizing same-sex marriage.
 
Here's the part of Prejean's answer that matters: ""I think in my country, in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised.""
 
Controversy followed.
 
So let's see how that stacks up to Obama's stated position on same-sex marriage:
 
* ""You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman."" (an interview with ABC's Jake Tapper, June 16, 2008)
 
* ""I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it's also a sacred union. You know, God's in the mix."" (an interview with Rev. Rick Warren, Aug. 16, 2008)
 
* ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage."" (an MTV interview, Nov. 1, 2008)
 
Sounds about the same to us.
 
Now, we should note that with all of these quotes during the presidential campaign, Obama quickly followed up by noting his support for civil unions.
 
The Jake Tapper interview is as representative of Obama's fuller position as any. In it, Obama said, ""I'm a strong supporter of civil unions. ... You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I also think that same-sex partners should be able to visit each other in hospitals, they should be able to transfer property, they should be able to get the same federal rights and benefits that are conferred onto married couples. And so, you know, as president, my job is to make sure that the federal government is not discriminating and that we maintain the federal government's historic role in not meddling with what states are doing when it comes to marriage law.""
 
Compare that to Prejean's comments to Fox's Greta Van Susteren on April 30.
 
""My thought on civil unions? You know what, Greta, I don't have the answers to everything. I'm not running for political office. I don't have the answers to everything, you know, in the world out there. But I think that there should be rights for people, you know, especially in California. I think that people that are homosexual should have some rights, you know, hospital rights, and things like that.""
 
Granted, her answer may not be as nuanced as Obama's. As she said, she's not running for public office. Still, her fuller position also sounds an awful lot like Obama's.
 
But what Prejean said after the pageant isn't the issue. Prejean and The Donald said the position she took the night of the pageant is consistent with President Obama's position. And we rate that claim True.

MoveOn targets senators who opposed new bankruptcy rules for homeowners
","
With record numbers of foreclosures looming, consumer advocates have been hoping Congress would make it easier for people in bankruptcy to have their home mortgages modified.
 
When you declare bankruptcy, you go into federal court and formally admit that you can no longer pay your debts. A judge then takes over to broker agreements between you and the people or businesses you owe.
 
Federal or state laws can govern the bankruptcy process, and rules differ by state. But under federal rules, judges can't change the terms of a home mortgage. They can, however, modify the terms of any mortgage that is not a primary residence, such as vacation homes.
 
Critics of the rule say it is unfair to people of more modest means, and that the rules should allow judges to lower the principal, cut interest rates or extend the terms of repayment. Measures allowing these things are known as ""cramdown"" legislation, because they typically force the lender to reduce the debt. The financial industry has opposed the measure because they say it will cost the banks money, and they will be required to raise interest rates on new mortgage customers.
 
The Senate voted against cramdown legislation on April 30, 2009, killing an amendment on a 45-51 vote. President Barack Obama supported the legislation.
 
The liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org has created advertisements targeting seven Democratic senators who voted against the legislation, which it calls ""commonsense bankruptcy reform.""
 
The ads are virtually identical. Here's the script for the ad about Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. (Specter recently switched parties and was a Democrat at the time of the vote.)
 
""Last week, Sen. Specter had a choice. Wall Street was trying to kill the president's proposal to help families facing foreclosure. Sen. Specter could side with the banks, or with Pennsylvania families. Sen. Specter has taken close to $6 million from the financial industry. So what did he do? Exactly what the banks wanted. And now millions of people will lose their homes because of it. Tell Sen. Specter to stand up for us — not the banks.""
 
We wanted to check MoveOn's math about what the senators had collected from the financial industry. We turned to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign contributions.
 
Here's the list of senators that MoveOn targeted, what MoveOn said they raised from the financial industry, and what the Center for Responsive Politics showed:
 
• Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa. — ""close to $6 million"" — career total: $5,753,310
 
• Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. — ""close to $3 million"" — career total: $3,020,966
 
• Sen. Ben Nelson, D.-Neb. — ""close to $3 million"" — career total: $2,667,406

We should note here that five other Democrats voted against the measure but were not targeted by MoveOn. A representative for MoveOn told us that those senators had either accepted less money from the financial industry or had a better overall voting record on MoveOn's core issues. Those senators included: Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.; and Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont.
 
Getting back to the ads, MoveOn says the senators voted with Wall Street and the banks after accepting campaign contributions from them. We can't say if there is a cause and effect, but MoveOn is right about how the senators voted. MoveOn approximates numbers for the campaign contributions — and clearly labels them approximations — and those numbers closely track the actual data from the Center for Responsive Politics. We rule MoveOn's collective statement that senators accepted millions in campaign contributions and voted against cramdown legislation as True.
