Social media claims about Louie Andersonâ€™s in-flight sickness after a COVID-19 booster arenâ€™t true
","On Jan. 21, comedian and actor Louie Anderson died. His longtime publicist, Glenn Schwartz, told reporters that Anderson died due to complications of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, a blood cancer.Â  But, perhaps predictably, some people online are suggesting that Andersonâ€™s death was connected to a COVID-19 vaccine.Â  One recent post shows what looks like a screenshot of an Instagram post showing Anderson posing with two flight attendants. Heâ€™s wearing a Kirkland Signature sweatshirt, a Minnesota Timberwolves hat and smiling broadly. No one in the photo is wearing a face mask.Â  ""Itâ€™s an early morning, but have Louie Anderson on our flt,"" the Instagram caption says. ""Heâ€™s off to do Conan ðŸ˜Ž."" Text thatâ€™s being shared alongside this screenshot suggests this picture was taken recently.Â  ""Louie Anderson was a passenger on my cousinâ€™s flight 2 days ago,"" it says. ""He was an extremely friendly man and spoke with her most of the flightâ€¦ They talked about his cancer and shared with her how heâ€™s been in remission 5 years now.. half way through the flight he started complaining about his heart.. he was swearing and pale and the staff became very worried.. he received medical treatment shortly after he landed.. he also spoke about the vaccine and how Mr. Anderson received his 3 vaccine a few weeks ago."" This post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to Schwartz about the post. ""Not true,"" he said in an email.Â  We reviewed photos that Anderson was tagged in on Instagram and couldnâ€™t find the one that appears in the Facebook post. But there are many that show him posing with fans, and some that seem to date the picture in the Facebook post to before the pandemic started.Â  We found several photos of him wearing a Timberwolves hat that were posted in fall 2017 and winter 2018, and photos of him wearing a Costco Kirkland Signature sweatshirt in 2016 and 2017.Â  Anderson played Zach Galifianakisâ€™ Costco-loving mother, Christine, in the 2016-19 show ""Baskets."" Christine would buy Costcoâ€™s Kirkland brand clothing for friends, and in one episode, offered to buy a Kirkland Signature sweatshirt for Galifianakisâ€™ wife. In March 2016, Anderson was photographed wearing a Kirkland Signature sweatshirt to a ""Baskets"" season finale viewing party.Â  But letâ€™s consider his recent appearance on the TBS show ""Conan,"" which ended its run on June 24, 2021. The Food and Drug Administration didnâ€™t authorize COVID-19 booster shots for immunocompromised people until a couple months later, in August, and they werenâ€™t available more widely until September.Â Â  According to IMDB, Anderson last appeared on Conan on March 16, and he did talk about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. But the appearance was remote. While Conan Oâ€™Brien was taping in Los Angeles, Anderson was streaming in from Henderson, Nevada.Â  ""You got vaccinated?"" Oâ€™Brien asks in the episode.Â  ""I did,"" Anderson replies. ""I just got my second shot and, God, just right after I got it, maybe an hour, I started getting nauseated, I was feeling sick, I called the doctor going, â€˜Can it happen that fast?â€™ and then I went, â€˜Oh, wait â€” I did stop and get White Castle on the way home.â€™""Â  He previously appeared in person on Oâ€™Brienâ€™s show before the pandemic started in June 2019, January 2018, August 2017 and February 2017, according to IMDb. If the Instagram caption that appears in the Facebook post is accurate, he would have likely been flying for his guest spot one of those times. The accompanying text about Anderson receiving a third vaccine dose doesnâ€™t line up with the description in the Instagram caption.

No, death totals from COVID-19 in England have not been overstated
","Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, some critics of measures to control the virus have downplayed its seriousness, suggesting the real death toll is much lower than what is being reported. Numbers released in the U.K. last month showing deaths solely attributed to COVID-19 have prompted another such claim. The headline for a YouTube video from ""The Jimmy Dore Show"" reads, ""Total deaths from COVID MUCH LOWER than reported."" Dore shares his interpretation of another YouTube video from a Britain named John Campbell, whose bio describes him as a ""a retired Nurse Teacher"" and emergency nurse with a Ph.D focused on nurse education. He has more than 2 million subscribers to his channel, where he often discusses his views on the COVID-19 pandemic. ""John Campbellâ€™s gonna tell you what the real death rate is in the U.K., and the answer is going to surprise you,"" Dore tells his viewers near the start of the video. Campbell then shares information released recently by the U.K.â€™s Office for National Statistics that he says shows that COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic attributed solely to the virus ""may be way lower than anyone had thought."" He then said that such data would likely also apply to the U.S. and the rest of the world. According to the data Campbell shows in his Jan. 20 video, in 2020 and the first three quarters of 2021, there were 17,371 deaths in England and Wales where the sole cause of death listed on death certificates was COVID-19. Since his video was published, fourth quarter numbers were released, showing a total of 18,907 deaths from COVID-19 alone.Â  ""So you mean all the stuff that theyâ€™ve been saying for two years straight about the death rate has been bullâ€”-?"" said Dore, who said Americans have been ""victims of a scaremongering campaign.""Â  No, thatâ€™s not what the numbers mean. According to the report cited in the video, there were 131,641 COVID-19 deaths overall in England and Wales at the time it was published and 140,776 in the most recent report. The numbers Campbell cites are those whose sole cause of death was listed as COVID-19. But that does not mean the other deaths attributed to the virus arenâ€™t also legitimate â€” they simply show people whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19 and other conditions at the same time. Separate numbers from the U.K. Health Security Agency show that 153,916 people died within 28 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis. It also reports 175,256 people have died with the virus mentioned as one of the causes of death. These figures include all of the U.K, including Northern Ireland and Scotland. ""We use the term â€˜due to COVID-19â€™ when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19. When taking into account all of the deaths that mentioned COVID-19 anywhere on the death certificate, whether as an underlying cause or not, we use the term â€˜involving COVID-19,â€™"" a spokesperson for the Office for National Statistics wrote in an email to PolitiFact. The spokesperson added that when doctors or coroners write death certificates, they only include health conditions that actually contributed to the cause of death. The certificate has two parts, one for the sequence of events leading directly to death and a second part for other health conditions that contributed, but were not part of the direct sequence leading to death. ""So, if a person did have COVID-19 but there was no reason to think that was at least part of the reason they died, the doctor or coroner would not write it on the death certificate. In other words, if COVID-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, it is always part of the cause of death, either on its own or in combination with other health conditions,"" he said. The Office of National Statistics website references the World Health Organization definition of ""underlying cause of death"" as the disease or injury that started ""the train of events directly leading to death."" In December, of deaths where COVID-19 was listed anywhere on the death certificate, 83.8% of those deaths in England and 79.6% in Wales list COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death, ONS data shows. Claims that COVID-19 deaths are lower than reported have been common throughout the pandemic from critics who argue the virus is not as serious as we are being led to believe. In fact, however, researchers have found evidence that overall deaths from COVID-19 have been undercounted, not overcounted, since the start of the pandemic. The title of a YouTube video shared on Facebook read, ""Total deaths from COVID MUCH LOWER than reported."" As evidence, the video points to numbers from England and Wales showing that 17,371 deaths were attributed to COVID-19 alone. But thatâ€™s a misleading interpretation of the data. The U.K. report cited in the video clearly states that all 131,641 deaths â€” more than seven times what the video claims â€”Â were ""due to COVID-19,"" meaning the virus was the underlying cause of death, even if the patients had preexisting health conditions that may have contributed.

COVID-19 vaccines do not contain graphene, are not experimental and have published ingredients
","A viral video includes a laundry list of previously debunked claims about COVID-19 vaccines, offered by people known for spreading misinformation. A Jan. 22 Facebook post has a caption that says, ""What Is In The mRNA Vaccines? You need to watch this video!,"" with a link to a 14-minute-long video. The Facebook post was shared by Ben Swann, a self-described journalist who has spread pandemic-related misinformation in the past. Those speaking in the video say a German doctor discovered that the COVID-19 vaccines include graphene oxide or graphene hydroxide. One of the speakers also says, ""Because these injections are experimental and they're only being used under the EUA, we do not know the full list of ingredients that's in them. No one knows."" The post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) All of the claims have been thoroughly debunked. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any form of graphene, according to multiple fact-checks. The vaccines are not experimental. They have undergone months of clinical testing; data shows they are both safe and effective; and they have been safely administered to hundreds of millions of Americans. And the full list of ingredients for all three vaccines approved for use in the U.S. â€” Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson â€” has been shared by manufacturers. In the video, Jeremy Slayden, a former professional baseball player, makes several false statements, including around the 20-second mark when he says there was ""a German doctor, Andreas Noack, who was murdered last week after he reported that graphene oxide was actually in the vaccines"" â€” a claim PolitiFact has rated False. Slayden ultimately asked the panel what is in the vaccines. At the 2:17 mark, Dr. Larry Pavlevsky, a pediatrician who has opposed vaccines, addresses the question, saying that the German doctor, Noack, ""found that it wasnâ€™t graphene oxide that was in it, it was graphene hydroxide,"" which ""breaks apart in the bloodstream and causes razor blade cuts"" to the lining of blood vessels. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any form of graphene. A Pfizer spokesperson in October confirmed that while graphene oxide is used in some vaccines, it is not used at Pfizer and is not in its COVID-19 vaccine. A full list of ingredients for all the vaccines is available on the CDC website.. Regarding Slaydenâ€™s question about what is in the vaccines, Pavlevsky answered ""Because these injections are experimental and they're only being used under the EUA, we do not know the full list of ingredients that's in them. No one knows."" The vaccines are not experimental. They were tested in clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants, and drug makers submitted reports on the outcomes and effects on every participant, PolitFact reported. The vaccines have been safely administered to hundreds of millions of Americans. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has granted full approval to the Pfizer vaccine for those 16 and older. Also, the Emergency Use Authorization that Pavlevsky referenced is only issued after a comprehensive review of the trial data. ""Clinical trial results and other requirements for emergency use are little different from what is required for final approval,"" PolitiFact reported. Despite Pavlevskyâ€™s assertion that ""we do not know the full list of ingredients,"" those lists have been published by manufacturers.

"['Civil Rights', 'North Carolina', 'Alma Adams']","
Did civil rights bills account for â€˜halfâ€™ of the bills successfully filibustered over 77 years?
","A North Carolina congresswoman says a tool for blocking legislation in the Senate has been used a significant number of times against civil rights measures. Democratic Rep. Alma Adams tweeted on Jan. 11: ""From 1917 to 1994, half of the bills that were successfully filibustered in the Senate were Civil Rights legislation."" Democrats have had trouble advancing their agenda in the U.S. Senate. Now many of them are calling on senators to eliminate the filibuster, a procedure that effectively raises the bar for bill approval from a simple majority to 60 votes.Â  Former President Barack Obama has referred to the filibuster as a ""Jim Crow relic"" and PolitiFact has written about how it was used to thwart civil rights legislation. We wondered if Adams was right about how frequently the filibuster was used against civil rights measures. Adamsâ€™ quote comes from one expertâ€™s article in the Washington Post. However, tracking the use of the filibuster isnâ€™t simple. While Adamsâ€™ stat is based on a credible analysis, some scholars take issue with it, saying that much depends on how one defines a filibuster and measures its success. The filibuster is a term that generally refers to a rule allowing a minority of senators to hold up legislation. Lawmakers can delay consideration of a bill by speaking on the Senate floor for hours at a time to state their opposition or to try to influence other senators. In some cases, the speeches go down as merely performative, having no influence on legislation. These days, senators donâ€™t actually need to speak for hours on the floor to effectively use the filibuster. They can simply say they object to the legislation under consideration. Then, to end debate on the bill, the Senate must trigger whatâ€™s known as ""cloture,"" which requires 60 votes in favor of proceeding to a final vote. Republicans effectively used the tool last year to block Democratsâ€™ voting rights legislation, known as the For The People Act. They also used it last week to defeat legislation that combined the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Thereâ€™s no official government tally for how many bills the filibuster has blocked. When it comes to civil rights, the U.S. Senate Historical Office says on its website: ""Filibusters proved to be particularly useful to Southern senators who sought to block civil rights legislation, including anti-lynching bills. Not until 1964 did the Senate successfully overcome a filibuster to pass a major civil rights bill."" The historical office has not tried to count the total number of filibusters used, said Daniel S. Holt, an assistant historian in the historical office. That is partly ""because the definition of a filibuster and what constitutes a filibuster is a matter of interpretation,"" Holt said.Â  Some bills have died under threat of filibuster, even if it wasnâ€™t officially employed. Holt said scholars who have tried to count the total number of filibusters have used different criteria and come up with different counts over the years.Â  When we reached Adams' office for comment, her spokesman cited an analysis published last year in The Washington Post. It was written by Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Binder looked into how the filibuster was used against civil rights for a book she wrote with Steven Smith of Washington University in St. Louis titled, ""Politics or Principle? Filibustering in the U.S. Senate."" Binder said she and Smith used historical sources to try to generate the list of measures that were killed by filibuster despite having support from a majority of members in both the House and Senate, as well as the White House.Â  ""Of the 30 measures we identified between 1917 and 1994, exactly half addressed civil rights â€” including measures to authorize federal investigation and prosecution of lynching, to ban the imposition of poll taxes and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of race in housing sales and rentals,"" she wrote for The Post. Binder acknowledged that other scholars have reached different conclusions. ""Ultimately, all these counts need an asterisk to make sure that readers understand the difficulty of recreating a comprehensive historical record,"" she said in an email to PolitiFact NC. Eric Schickler, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, thinks Binderâ€™s sentiment is generally accurate. Schickler co-authored the book, ""Filibuster: Obstruction and Lawmaking in the U.S. Senate."" ""If you just say, â€˜What were the measures that likely had the majority in favor of it, that were defeated because of minority instruction?â€™ I think it's right to say that about half of them, in that period, were civil rights-related bills,"" Schickler said. If Binderâ€™s count of bills defeated by the filibuster seems low, Schickler notes that it was unusual for the tool to be used to permanently kill a bill until the 1970s. The exception was civil rights, he said. ""The senators who were opposed to [a particular civil rights measure] tended to be much more committed than the senators in favor of it,"" he said. ""So in other words, the Southern senators who opposed civil rights in, letâ€™s say â€™20s, â€™30s, â€™40s and â€™50s, they were willing to pull out all the stops and use obstruction to the kill.""Â  Thereâ€™s not a consensus on Binderâ€™s count. The percentage of filibusters that affected civil rights is probably lower than half, says Gregory Koger, chair of the University of Miamiâ€™s political science department. Koger wrote, ""Filibustering: A Political History of Obstruction in the House and Senate."" Koger said it may be easier to track the fate of civil rights bills because, between the 1930s and 1960s, senators were more likely to call for cloture votes on them than on other filibustered legislation. ""This enabled them to create a public record of their position for the press and interest groups, knowing that the votes would fail,"" he told PolitiFact NC in an email. Koger says his thorough and ""systematic"" approach to finding defeated bills ""identified many more instances of non-civil rights filibusters, so the overall proportion was much less than one-half."" Gregory Wawro co-authored ""Filibuster: Obstruction and Lawmaking in the U.S. Senate"" with Schickler and has a slightly different opinion. ""My sense is that (Binderâ€™s) number is probably too high, but I don't know that we should get too hung up on that,"" said Wawro, chair of the political science department at Columbia University. ""The general point that (Binder and Smith) are making still holds: the class of bills most successfully targeted during this period were civil rights bills. I don't think whether it was half or less than half really matters that much,"" Wawro said. Adams said: ""From 1917 to 1994, half of the bills that were successfully filibustered in the Senate were civil rights legislation.""Â  Her claim is supported by an analysis by a political scientist who has co-authored a book on the history of the filibuster. However, some scholars arenâ€™t in agreement on this issue. At least two other experts say civil rights bills probably accounted for less than half of bills successfully filibustered during the highlighted time period. The statement is partially accurate: some experts do support Adams' claim. However, it leaves out important details: other experts say the stat is off. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2E1840>],/factchecks/2022/jan/24/alma-adams/did-civil-rights-bills-account-half-bills-successf/

Aaron Rodgers repeats debunked CDC data on COVID-19 deaths and comorbidities
","NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers is in the headlines again, not only because his Green Bay Packers lost their divisional playoff game to the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 22, but also because heâ€™s making more false claims about the COVID-19 pandemic.Â Â  Rodgers, who says he is unvaccinated, recently went on an anti-vaccine tirade in an interview with ESPN, criticizing President Joe Biden and his ""fake White House."" At one point, Rodgers brought up the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to claim that officials were sending mixed messages about the pandemic, saying: ""Then you have the CDC, which, how do you even trust them, but then they come out and talk about 75% of the COVID deaths have at least four comorbidities. And you still have this fake White House set saying that this is the pandemic of the unvaccinated, that's not helping the conversation."" Rodgers â€” who made false statements about the pandemic in November â€” has his facts wrong again. The CDC didnâ€™t find that 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in individuals who had at least four other illnesses or diseases, known as comorbidities. The figure is based on a study of 1.2 million fully vaccinated people that found around 78% of deaths in the group occurred in people with multiple other illnesses, bolstering the argument that vaccines work. The claim, which PolitiFact and others have debunked, started circulating in mid-January after ABC News released a shortened version of a ""Good Morning America"" interview with CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. The clip showed Walensky responding to a question from White House correspondent Cecilia Vega about how a recent CDC study seemed to show vaccines working to prevent severe illness. But the clip cut off the beginning of her response in which it was clear that she was referring to a study of only vaccinated people.Â Â  Her full response: ""A really important studyÂ â€” if I may just summarize itÂ â€” a study of 1.2 million people who were vaccinated between December and October and demonstrated that severe disease occurred in about 0.015% of the people who receive their primary series. And death in 0.003% of those people. The overwhelming number of deaths â€” over 75% â€” occurred in people who had at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who were unwell to begin with. And yes, really encouraging news in the context of omicron. This means not only just to get your primary series, but to get your booster series. And yes, weâ€™re really encouraged by these results."" The study involved just over 1.2 million people who completed their primary vaccination series â€” two shots for mRNA vaccines â€” from December 2020 through October 2021. It found that severe COVID-19-associated outcomes or death were rare among the group: 36 died of COVID-19.Â  Risk factors included being over 65 years old or having a suppressed immune system. All people who experienced severe disease had at least one risk factor, the report said, and 28 of the people who died, or 78%, had at least four. Rodgers claimed that the CDC said that 75% of COVID-19 deaths involved people who had four or more comorbidities. This misrepresents the CDCâ€™s findings. The figure is based on a study involving fully vaccinated individuals that found over 75% of deaths in that group occurred in people who had multiple other diseases and conditions. The statistic was cited by medical officials as evidence that the vaccines were effective in preventing severe disease.

Why itâ€™s wrong to call the voting rights bill a federal takeover
","In Arizona, citizens can vote early for nearly a month before Election Day. In New Hampshire, early voting doesn't exist. In Florida, any voter can request a mail ballot. In Texas, only some voters can vote absentee, such as those who are old, sick, in jail or out of town. Democrats say this patchwork of state rules makes no sense when citizens vote in federal elections, and have pushed legislation to create uniform rules. Republicans have blocked that effort, arguing that the powers belong in the hands of state lawmakers. Many Republican lawmakers have derided voting rights legislation as a ""federal takeover"" of elections.Â  ""This is not some modest bill about ballot access,"" said Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell Jan. 19, the day an effort to push the voting rights legislation past a Senate filibuster failed. ""Itâ€™s a sprawling takeover of our whole political system."" McConnell referred to the legislation as a ""federal takeover"" of elections in an interview the next day on Fox News. The Democratic-backed legislation â€” the Freedom to Vote Act, which now incorporates legislation named after the late congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis â€” would expand the federal governmentâ€™s role in setting uniform rules, such as about acceptable forms of voter ID. But the text of the legislation and most experts we talked to suggest that calling it a federal ""takeover"" is a mischaracterization, because it would still leave intact many election administration powers held by state and local officials. Weâ€™ve reviewed similar claims in the past that a particular measure pending in Congress represents a federal takeover of a particular function or industry, such as health care or child care. Itâ€™s a common talking point among conservatives who favor limited government or statesâ€™ rights. In fact-checking such claims, weâ€™ve considered whether the measure calls for the federal government to assume total control of the sector, or whether it just adds a level of regulation that the Constitution allows for. ""The â€˜federal takeoverâ€™ language could be read to imply that the Freedom to Vote Act would result in state and local election officials no longer running elections,"" said Rebecca Green, election law professor at William and Mary University. ""That of course is not the case. State legislatures and state/local election officials would continue to run elections in their state, but would be required to administer certain aspects of elections in a more uniform way."" Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution includes a role for state legislatures as well as Congress in governing federal elections. ""The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof,"" it says in Section 4, ""but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations."" This clause shows that ""the founders anticipated that Congress has a role to play in determining how elections are run,"" Green said. She pointed to multiple examples where Congress exercised that authority, including the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which banned discriminatory voting practices; the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, requiring states to offer voter registration at motor vehicle agencies; and the Help America Vote Act of 2002, requiring states to update their voting equipment and voter registration records. Even some conservative champions have affirmed Congressâ€™ power. ""The power of Congress over the â€˜Times, Places and Mannerâ€™ of congressional elections â€˜is paramount, and may be exercised at any time, and to any extent which it deems expedient,"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a ruling on a 2013 Arizona case.Â ""AndÂ so far as it is exercised, and no farther, the regulations effected supersede those of the State â€¦ ."" The bill thatâ€™s now stalled in the Senate combined two pieces of voting rights legislation: the Freedom to Vote Act, a sweeping elections bill, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named in honor of the former Georgia congressman and civil-rights leader, which aims to reestablish rules that prevent states from passing discriminatory voting laws. The Freedom to Vote Act is partly a response to restrictive state laws passed by Republicans following the 2020 election that limited early voting, mail ballots, drop boxes and other mechanisms that broadened voting access. It would set uniform policies for voting by mail and in person in federal elections, as well as various aspects of election administration, such as audits of results. The bill would mandate some policies that are already used in many states, such as same-day voter registration.Â  Ilya Shapiro, vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute, said he views the Freedom to Vote Act as a federal takeover ""because Congress would be setting election rules for the whole country."" But it wouldnâ€™t be setting all the rules. Officials at the county or local level would still have the responsibility to process mail ballot requests, operate polling places, set up and test equipment, and tabulate results. State or local officials would still set their own budgets to pay for elections (although the legislation offers federal grants for some initiatives such as training poll workers). Local officials would retain their power to hire election workers, although the legislation sets guideposts for state officials who fire local election administrators. ""No one is proposing that federal officials take over these responsibilities,"" said Harvard law professor Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos, who has advised some nonprofit groups involved in drafting the bill. The election bill would establish a federal floor with respect to many aspects of voting and redistricting, but state and local officials could depart upward from this floor, Stephanopoulos said. Nothing would prevent a state from offering more than the required two weeks of early voting in the legislation, as some states already do. ""This is what federal regulation often does â€” preclude some bad choices by state and local officials but leave lots of good options on the table,"" Stephanopoulos said. Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California at Irvine, said it is fair to think of the question of federalization on a spectrum. While there are already many federal rules from laws passed by Congress that impose requirements on states, he said, ""the Freedom to Vote Act would expand the federal role by doing things like imposing additional standards for how to run federal elections."" ""But it is not a complete federal takeover of elections,"" he added. ""States still would have lots of discretion on many aspects of election administration."" The legislation technically applies only to federal elections â€” for president and Congress â€” but as a practical matter it would apply to state and local elections as well because those races often happen at the same time, and itâ€™s impractical to operate under separate rules for contests on the same ballot. The part of the legislation named for Lewis would restore â€” and expand â€” a role the federal government had under the 1965 Voting Rights Act in ensuring that new state voting laws donâ€™t discriminate against minority voters. From 1965 to 2013, changes to voting laws in certain jurisdictions that had a history of racially discriminatory laws had to go through a federal review, a process known as preclearance. But in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ended that practice, ruling that the formula used to determine which jurisdictions had to go through preclearance was outdated, since it was based on practices in the 1960s and 1970s. The court wrote that if Congress wanted preclearance to resume, it ""must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions."" The legislation aims to do just that, imposing the preclearance requirement on jurisdictions that had committed a certain number of voting rights violations during the previous 25 years.Â  For certain types of voting changes, such as stricter voter ID requirements, preclearance would apply nationwide. Other changes such as reducing the number of polling sites would require preclearance if they are in areas with a substantial number of minorities. ""This is a substantial broadening of the VRA's original preclearance requirements, which had been limited solely to certain covered jurisdictions"" and others that were added later by courts, said Michael Morley, an election law professor at Florida State University. But overall, the concept of the federal government reviewing state laws is not new. ""We had preclearance from 1965 to 2013, and it was not considered a federal takeover of elections,"" Hasen said. McConnell said that the federal Freedom to Vote legislation is ""a sprawling takeover of our whole political system."" The legislation would give the federal government more power to set uniform rules for voter registration and casting ballots, and to review changes to state voting laws to make sure they wonâ€™t discriminate against minority voters.Â  But adding regulations does not amount to a ""takeover"" of the ""whole political system,"" which implies that the federal government alone would have absolute power over the way campaigns and elections are conducted. Under the Democratsâ€™ legislation, state and local officials would still be in charge of choosing voting sites, hiring local election officials, setting local elections budgets and staffing polling sites.Â  McConnellâ€™s argument ignores that the U.S. the Constitution gives Congress broad power to make or alter election regulations.

No, there is no â€˜Kalergi planâ€™ to replace Europeans with migrants
","As the wounds from World War I were still festering in Europe, and as the continent prepared for an even bloodier war, a Japanese-Austrian politician proposed a peaceful federation in Europe. The plan by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, published as a book in the 1920s, was surprisingly predictive of the European Union that would appear only decades later, after World War II. It described a bloc of 26 countries tied in a customs union, a single market, and a monetary zone, with a continental parliament, a single currency, and an anthem. The union would deal with other countries as one, but would also respect internal national differences. Despite its ingenuity, very little of that plan is remembered now. Instead, Kalergi is better known for an evil scheme that he never actually authored. According to distortions and fabrications first made by Nazis, repurposed by neo-Nazis, adopted by the European far-right and, more recently, referenced by American conservatives, Kalergi planned the destruction of white European civilization through migration and interracial marriage. A video shared recently on TikTok summarizes the conspiracy theory. It shows Nick Griffin, a far-right British politician and former member of the European Parliament, claiming that Kalergi ""published the plan for a united Europe and the ethnocide of the peoples of Europe."" According to Griffin, migrant groups like guest workers and refugees are being encouraged to come to Europe by an ""unholy alliance"" of leftists, Zionists, and capitalists ""with the deliberate aim of breeding us out of existence in our own homelands."" Other right-wing politicians and groups in Europe have mentioned Kalergi and his ""plan,"" including in Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the Czech Republic. It has also generated interest online whenever tensions over migration were high in Europe. Searches for ""Kalergi"" rose during the migrant crisis in 2015, according to Google Trends, and spiked again when far-right parties in Germany and Italy made migration a central issue of electoral campaigns.Â  Griffinâ€™s video was shared on TikTok in 2021 with a reference to the Belarus-Poland border crisis, when the government of Belarus incentivized migrants to travel to the country and cross the border with Poland. The ""Kalergi plan"" conspiracy theory is a European variation of the conspiracy theories about ""white genocide"" that have been mentioned by mainstream American conservatives in recent years, and that inspired the gunman who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in 2019 and shooters in two synagogues in the United States. The idea has remained popular despite the lack of evidence that European elites are carrying out such a plan of migrant invasion. When John Stuart Agnew, a right-wing British politician and former member of the European Parliament, asked the European Commission in 2019 about a ""Kalergi plan,"" the commission answered that it was not aware of any ""plan"" and pointed to its migration policy, which has been updated multiple times over the past decade. It makes sense that a ""Kalergi plan"" is not being executed, since there is no evidence that Kalergi ever proposed one. According to Martyn Bond, the author of a recent biography of Kalergi, his writings mention the mixing of races, but as a description of what he was observing around him, and a prediction of something that would continue to happen in the future.Â  ""(Kalergi) objectively describes what was already occurring and would increasingly occur â€” racial mixing â€” as various factors of globalization became ever more apparent,"" Bond wrote. But they were descriptions, not prescriptions. The claim that he ""aimed to eliminate the white race through racial mixing with immigrants from outside Europe"" is a ""gross misreading"" of his work, according to Bond. Kalergiâ€™s own writings show that he wanted to strengthen Europe believing that only a united continent would be able to face giants like the United States and the Soviet Union. He also thought that European culture was ""striding victoriously ahead"" and would eventually ""absorb"" other cultures. Bond told PolitiFact that despite his mixed heritage, Kalergi held an assumption of ""white Christian superiority"" â€” a view that his far-right detractors ""might even approve."" Although conspiracy theories about ""white genocide"" are older, the specific claims related to Kalergi have their origins in Nazi Germany, according to historians Roland Clark and Nikolaus Hagen.Â  They were circulated, among others, by the newspaper of the Nazi Party, which used xenophobic, anti-Semitic, and racist language to describe Kalergi as ""the commercial prophet of Pan-Europe"" and ""a dressed-up, nasty mongrel"" who ""dreams of a world of Eurasian-Negroid humans, subject to the God-given rule of the Jews."" According to Clark and Hagen, the claims made by the Nazis were recovered decades later by Gerd Honsik, an Austrian neo-Nazi and convicted Holocaust denier. Honsik published a book in the early 2000s describing what he termed the ""Kalergi plan"" and promoted the conspiracy theory in Europe. ""Honsik sent out hundreds of newsletters and open letters to politicians, and his books were translated in many different languages,"" Hagen told PolitiFact. ""It's not surprising that his ideas were picked up in neo-Nazi and Holocaust-denial circles."" What is more ""puzzling and worrying,"" according to Hagen, ""is how this fringe conspiracy theory recently penetrated the mainstream political discourse."" A post on TikTok shows a video claiming that an elite is carrying out a plan to replace white Europeans with non-white migrants, and that this plan was devised by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, an early proponent of continental unification in Europe. There is no evidence that the plan exists. The idea that it does lies in distortions of Kalergiâ€™s writings and fabrications by Nazis and neo-Nazis, according to information from historians, Kalergiâ€™s biographer, the European Commission, and Kalergiâ€™s own writings.

Fact-checking Louisiana Senate candidate Gary Chambersâ€™ claims about marijuana arrests
","Gary Chambers Jr., a Democrat who hopes to represent Louisiana in the U.S. Senate, made headlines by releasing a 37-second political ad in which he smokes marijuana while reciting a number of statistics about marijuana laws and how theyâ€™re enforced. ""Every 37 seconds, someone is arrested for possession of marijuana,"" Chambers said, his narration playing over the sound of a ticking timer. ""Since 2010, state and local police have arrested an estimated 7.3 million Americans for violating marijuana laws â€” over half of all drug arrests.""Â  He continued: ""Black people are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana laws than white people. States waste $3.7 billion enforcing marijuana laws every year. Most of the people police are arresting arenâ€™t dealers, but rather people with small amounts of pot, just like me."" My first campaign ad, â€˜37 Seconds.â€™ #JustLikeMeI hope this ad works to not only destigmatize the use of marijuana, but also forces a new conversation that creates the pathway to legalize this beneficial drug, and forgive those who were arrested due to outdated ideology. pic.twitter.com/G0qKvmUGKD While many news outlets focused on Chambersâ€™ surprising use of marijuana in a political ad, PolitiFact wanted to dig into the data he cites. We found that Chamberâ€™s claim was based on 2010 data that referred to marijuana arrests generally. But the 37 second figure doesnâ€™t hold up when compared with recent figures specific to marijuana possession, which have slowed in recent years, due in part to state changes in legalization. The ad cited the American Civil Liberties Union as a data source. A spokesperson for the Chambers campaign said the team primarily pulled its numbers from an ACLU report published in June 2013 and a slideshow that appeared to be based on the same report. ""We additionally spoke with a variety of experts in the cannabis lobbying space to ensure we had industry-accepted numbers,"" added campaign spokesperson Katie Dolan. She pointed out that the ACLUâ€™s landing page for the 2013 report and the slideshow both said that ""cops made one pot bust every 37 seconds."" The ACLU report said its annual marijuana arrest data was ""obtained largely"" from FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data. The FBIâ€™s UCR program annually collects law enforcement data from various city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies.Â  The data has its limitations: Participation in the UCR program is voluntary, definitions of crimes can vary among local jurisdictions, and the same information is not always reported year to year. The ACLU noted that some areas (Illinois, Florida, the District of Columbia, and the five boroughs of New York City) do not report data on marijuana possession arrests by race to the FBI, so records requests were filed to obtain that data. Within the report, the ACLU drilled into the specifics: ""In 2010 alone, there were 889,133 marijuana arrests â€” 300,000 more than arrests for all violent crimes combined â€” or one every 37 seconds."" The ACLU referenced ""marijuana arrests"" generally, meaning the number includes people arrested for crimes beyond just possession, such as dealing, so Chambersâ€™ claim is off in that regard.Â  In 2010, there were 784,021 marijuana possession arrests, according to the ACLU. Using that value, arrests occurred at a pace less frequent than once every 37 seconds.Â Â  In an updated report issued in 2020, the ACLU again relied on UCR data to examine marijuana arrests from 2010 to 2018. And though it did not include an updated figure about how frequently marijuana arrests occurred, PolitiFact reached out to experts about what more recent data indicates. Experts say that arrests now occur less frequently.Â  Aaron Madrid Aksoz, an ACLU spokesperson, said data current through 2018 now shows there were ""6.1 million marijuana-related arrests between 2010 and 2018."" From there, he calculated that there was one marijuana-related arrest every 46.56 seconds. Paul Armentano, deputy director of the pro-marijuana legalization organization NORML, said annual state-level marijuana-related arrests have been trending downward since about 2009. Data from 2019 and 2020 showed significant drops in marijuana-related arrests. The decrease coincides with the increased legalization of marijuana. Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana with a 2012 ballot initiative, and since then, 17 other states, Washington, D.C., and Guam have decriminalized recreational marijuana.Â  Jon Gettman, an associate professor of criminal justice at Shenandoah University, has extensively researched data on marijuana arrests and helped the ACLU compile its 2013 report. Gettman used 2019 FBI data to do his calculations and concluded there was one marijuana-related arrest every 58 seconds. Matt Sutton of Drug Policy Alliance used the FBIâ€™s estimated number of arrests in 2020 to run the calculations using the most recent data available from UCR. It showed there were about 1.16 million ""drug abuse violation"" arrests in 2020.Â  Of those arrests, 2.8% were for selling or manufacturing marijuana and 27.5% were for possession, for a total of about 350,150 marijuana-related arrests and 317,793 marijuana possession arrests. Those calculations, then, show that in 2020, there was one marijuana-related arrest every 90 seconds, and one marijuana possession arrest about every 99 seconds. Chambersâ€™ other claims in the ad have varying degrees of accuracy.Â  ""Since 2010, state and local police have arrested an estimated 7.3 million Americans for violating marijuana laws â€” over half of all drug arrests."" This could use a little more context. FBI data shows that about 7.35 million marijuana arrests have been made since 2010. But the proportion of drug arrests that were marijuana-related has been decreasing. In 2018, marijuana-related arrests accounted for 40% of all drug arrests in the U.S. In 2020, that share has fallen to 30.3%.Â  ""Black people are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana laws than white people."" Thatâ€™s accurate when rounding up. The campaign drew that data from ACLUâ€™s 2013 and 2020 reports.Â  ""States waste $3.7 billion enforcing marijuana laws every year."" The figure seems to be based on very general figures about how much the U.S. spends on police protection. The U.S. spent $100 billion on police protection in 2017, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report. Marijuana arrests accounted for about 6.3% of all arrests that year. Assuming broadly that the percentage of arrests is equivalent to the percentage of costs, the U.S. seems to spend significantly more than $3.7 billion enforcing marijuana laws each year. Whether itâ€™s a waste is a matter of opinion. ""Most of the people police are arresting arenâ€™t dealers, but rather people with small amounts of pot."" Thatâ€™s true. Using FBI data, the ACLU reports show that the vast majority of marijuana-related arrests are for possession. In 2020, FBI data indicated that about 91% of marijuana arrests were for possession.Â Â  Chambers said, ""Every 37 seconds, someone is arrested for possession of marijuana."" The claim was based on 2010 data that dealt with marijuana-related arrests, but it is outdated now.Â  Experts, including a spokesperson for the ACLU, say that more recent data indicates that marijuana-related arrests now happen less frequently â€” at a rate of about one every 46 seconds, 58 seconds or 90 seconds, depending on how you approach the math problem. And 2020 data suggests an arrest for marijuana possession alone occurs every 99 seconds â€” still frequent, but a far slower rate than Chambersâ€™ ad suggests.

Did Loudoun County, Va. schools pay 'about $300,000' for critical race theory training?
","EDITOR'S NOTE, Jan. 27, 6:15 p.m.:Â We recently published a fact-check on this same claim by Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Her office did not reply to three requests for comment. After the article ran, Earle-Searsâ€™ office sent us the sources behind her statement. We have updated the fact-check with her information and with more information from Loudoun County Public Schools. But it does not change our ruling that Earle-Searsâ€™ statement is Mostly False. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears recently told Fox News that critical race theory ""is definitely being taught in some form or fashion,"" in Virginiaâ€™s public schools. ""We know last year the Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 â€” thatâ€™s real money, thatâ€™s going-to-jail money â€” to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system,"" Earle-Sears, a Republican, said in a Jan. 17 interview.Â  Critical race theory â€” a 45-year-old academic construct about systemic bias and privilege â€” has become a political flashpoint across the nation. It holds that racism is part of a broader pattern in America: It is woven into laws, and it shows up in who gets a job interview, the sort of home loans people are offered, how they are treated by police and other facets of daily life large and small. There is a movement by some educators to incorporate critical race theory into instruction, particularly in U.S. history which they say has been taught from a white vantage point. Conservatives in Virginia and across the nation have strongly opposed teaching the theory, saying because the approach focuses on race, it is fundamentally racist. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said in his campaign last fall that the theory has infiltrated Virginia schools and vowed to end its spread. Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 15, Youngkin signed an executive order banning ""the use"" of critical race theory.Â  He has set up a hotline for parents to report the teaching of the theory and other ""divisive practices"" in schools. Critics say there is no evidence the theory is being widely taught in Virginia and Youngkin and his supporters have struggled to provide proof. We asked Earle-Searsâ€™ office for the source of her claim about Loudounâ€™s $300,000 investment in critical race theory and were sent two news articles: A Sept. 28, 2020, story in The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, headlined, ""Loudoun County Schools Spend Hundreds of Thousands on Critical Race Theory;"" A Nov. 9, 2021, column by Mark Thiessen, a conservative columnist for The Washington Post, saying Loudoun ""paid $314,000 for critical race theory coaching for its teachersâ€¦"". Both articles refer to money Loudoun paid The Equity Collaborative, a California-based consulting group, to interview students, parents and teachers and make recommendations on how the racial atmosphere and policies in schools could be improved.Â  The Collaborative was paid $422,500 between September 2018 and June 2020, according to county records. No payments were made to the consultant last year, as Earle-Sears claimed.Â Â  Thereâ€™s much debate over the contention of Earle-Sears and others that the money was spent ""to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system."" Wayde Byard, spokesman for Loudoun schools, told us the county paid $34,167 in June 2020 for seminars on critical race theory. He said the purpose was to familiarize senior officials with the theory and that no additional money was spent on CRT. Loudoun Superintendent Scott Ziegler says the theory is not being taught to students. He says critics are conflating the theory with Loudounâ€™s efforts to bring equity to the way students are treated in school, where most of the money was spent. The Collaborative charged the county $242,000 to interview students, parents and teachers about the racial climate in schools and what could make them more welcoming to minorities. The consultants were paid for conducting equity leadership seminars designed to help teachers relate to minorities, as well as travel. Loudounâ€™s school system has seen huge growth and demographic change in recent decades. It is no longer majority White. The system began its equity work amid reports that found Black students were being inordinately suspended and expelled. The Collaborative released a 28-page report in June 2019 that did not mention critical race theory. It concluded that Loudoun teachers and principals had a ""low level of racial consciousness,"" discipline of Black students was disproportionately severe and that many minority students encountered racial slurs and violent actions from other students. Based on the findings, Loudoun drew up a 22-page ""Plan to Combat Systemic Racism."" It called for teacher training in racial literacy and competence, a ban on students wearing Confederate flag items and the development of alternative punishments to suspension and expulsion, which are shown to severely harm student outcomes.Â  While Loudoun draws a distinction between critical race theory and its equity program, critics of the school system do not. ""Theyâ€™re using semantics, the other side is, when it comes to CRT and itâ€™s definitely being taught in some form or another,"" Earle-Sears told Fox News. Earle-Sears said, ""We know last year the Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 â€” thatâ€™s real money, thatâ€™s going-to-jail money â€” to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system.""Â  Earle-Sears has a little ground beneath her. In 2020, the school system paid a consultant $34,167 to conduct seminars for senior officials on critical race theory and equity training.Â  But her statement is otherwise tenuous. The seminars were a slice of $422,500 Loudoun spent to improve racial equity in its school amid reports that disproportionate numbers of BlackÂ students were being suspended or expelled. The money was spent from September 2018 to June 2020 â€” not last year as Earle-Sears says. The consultants helped Loudoun develop policies aimed at making schools more welcoming and fair to minorities. The work focused on treating students fairly, not what they should learn in classrooms. Earle-Searsâ€™ statement confuses the matter and we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A5F480>],/factchecks/2022/jan/24/winsome-sears/did-loudoun-county-va-schools-pay-about-300000-cri/

COVID-19 death toll has not been overcounted
","An Instagram post imploring readers to use ""simple math"" asserts that U.S. deaths from COVID-19 are vastly overcounted. The viral post says the number of estimated annual COVID-19 deaths in the United States is 27,530. Thatâ€™s a long way away from the 385,460 people who the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says died from COVID-19 in 2020 and the 453,707 who died in 2021. The premise of the post is that a more factual number of deaths would subtract those who died ""with COVID, not from,"" those who didn't dieÂ in nursing homes and those who didn't have four or more comorbidities. ""It's just simple math,"" the caption says. ""Even with these inflated numbers, is 28k deaths a year worth what we are doing (to) society and peoples lives? This is insane."" But in this case, the post itself just doesnâ€™t add up. It was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two of the postâ€™s main premises â€” that the overall COVID-19 death count is inflated by people who died ""with"" rather than ""from"" the virus, and that 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in people with four or more comorbidities â€” have been previously debunked. And though nursing home residents are an already-vulnerable population, studies showed that their risk of dying increased during the pandemic. The false notion that the numbers of people dying from COVID-19 have been skewed because they include people who died ""with"" rather than ""from"" COVID-19 dates to August 2020. Thatâ€™s when then-President Donald Trump retweeted several posts that claimed the CDC was adjusting coronavirus deaths downward. The claims were based on a federal report that indicated that of all Americans whose deaths were attributed to COVID-19 on their death certificates, only 6% did not also list other conditions as being factors. The vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients who have other conditions, which are also listed on their death certificates, but that doesnâ€™t mean COVID-19 was not a factor in their deaths. ""Early in the pandemic, some of the answers provided by public officials â€” who were scrambling to track the disease as it overwhelmed health systems â€” fed skepticism,"" according to an article by the Association of American Medical Colleges. The article pointed to April 2020 comments by one White House official who was asked about people who have COVID-19 but die from preexisting conditions; she answered: ""If someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death."" But ""federal and state governments gradually altered such policies over the spring and summer to say that in order for a death to be counted as a COVID-19 death, the disease had to have played a role,"" AAMC reported. The CDC considers the underlying cause of death as ""the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the personâ€™s death,"" Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the NCHS told PolitiFact in August 2020. In 92% of death certificates that mention the virus, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. The postâ€™s claim about nursing home deaths appears to stem from the same logic â€” that the deaths occurred in an already-vulnerable population that often has comorbidities, so they should be excluded from the overall count. But we found nothing that would suggest a solid, scientific reason for backing those numbers out of the equation. One study found that for those in long-term care facilities, the risk of dying increased by 4.29% during the pandemic compared with before the pandemic. Whatâ€™s more, research and news stories have found evidence that even with the official data collection processes, deaths from COVID-19 have been underreported in nursing homes. The claim that 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in people with four or more comorbidities is False. It originated when social media users skewed a Jan. 7 statement from CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky pertaining to deaths of vaccinated people. She said in an interview that a study of COVID-19 deaths in people who had been vaccinated found that more than 75% of them occurred in those who had at least four other illnesses or diseases at the time they became infected with the virus. She cited it as evidence of the vaccinesâ€™ effectiveness. However, an edited clip of the interview that circulated heavily did not include the fact that the study only included vaccinated people, leaving aÂ  false impression that the 75% statistic reflected all COVID-19 deaths and that the pandemicâ€™s severity had been exaggerated. Contrary to the assertion of the post, researchers have found evidence that overall deaths from COVID-19 have been undercounted, not overcounted, since the start of the pandemic.

The CDC tracks what it calls ""excess deaths"" â€” the difference in the observed numbers of deaths in a period of time compared with prior years. Deaths from all causes, not just COVID-19, have increased since the pandemic started. The CDC says undercounts could be attributed to a number of factors, including deaths being misclassified or those indirectly related to the pandemic, like health conditions that went untreated due to overburdened health care systems.Â  USA Today analyzed that data and other research and in December found that public health experts believe the true death toll of the pandemic in the U.S. to be ""upward of 20% or more higher than the official tally."" An Instagram post says the number of estimated annual COVID-19 deaths in the United States is 27,530, after you subtract those who died ""with, not from"" COVID-19, not in nursing homes and who didn't have four or more comorbidities. Thatâ€™s bad math built on several false assumptions and arriving at a false conclusion. COVID-19 was found to be a cause of death for 385,460 people in 2020 and 452,707 people in 2021, according to the CDC. And research shows that, if anything, deaths resulting from COVID-19 have been undercounted, not overcounted, in the U.S. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!Â  Â ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097837900>],/factchecks/2022/jan/21/instagram-posts/covid-19-death-toll-has-not-been-overcounted/

Ashli Babbitt vs. antifa? Video falsely claims Babbitt â€˜tried to stop antifa false flagâ€™ on Jan. 6
","In the year since Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot trying to force her way further inside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, a chorus of conservative voices have cast her as a patriot and a martyr, and her death as an unjust assassination.Â  A new narrative circulating online takes those claims further. ""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6,"" said the title of one video posted Jan. 19, 2022. ""She was trying to stop those people from busting up the place, and then had to flee from them,"" the speaker in the video said. ""Thatâ€™s why she went through the window, and then got shot, got assassinated by that f------- rent-a-cop."" The video offered a conspiratorial retelling of what transpired during one of dayâ€™s most scrutinized moments, when Babbitt attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speakerâ€™s Lobby, where lawmakers were being evacuated. It relied on an interpretation of Jan. 6 footage from a right-wing outlet that made unsubstantiated claims about Babbittâ€™s words, actions and frame of mind in the moments before she died. In reality, there is no clear evidence that Babbitt was fighting to halt the mob â€” or that the attack was a false flag spurred on by antifa.Â  The insurrection was carried out by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, many of them whipped up by his false claims of a stolen election.

Michael Byrd, a Capitol Police officer for 28 years â€” was cleared of wrongdoing in two investigations.Â   A video spread on YouTube and other platforms wrongly claimed Ashli Babbitt tried to stop an antifa false flag on Jan. 6, 2021. This video spread widely anyway, racking up 200,000 views on YouTube and tens of thousands more on the alternative platforms like Rumble and Bitchute. It was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Â  The creator of the video is a self-described former Obama voter and special education teacher who now posts live-streams and other content under the persona ""the Salty Cracker.""Â  His website has a disclaimer at the bottom of his website that reads, ""These are the opinions and ramblings of a lunatic. They are for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong."" Many of his claims in the nearly 10-minute video were, as promised, wrong: He called the attack a ""false flag hoax."" It wasnâ€™t. It was an effort to flip an election that left several people dead, more than 140 officers injured, and $1.5 million in property damage.Â  He insisted that a man named Ray Epps instigated the siege as one of several ""FBI assets."" Thatâ€™s not true. There is no evidence that the FBI orchestrated the attack, and Epps, a former Oath Keeper seen near the Capitol on videos, told the House committee investigating the attack that he has no ties to the FBI or law enforcement.Â  He said that the rioters who supported Trump were sentenced to 40 years in prison for ""staying in between the velvet lines."" Thatâ€™s false. Claims that Jan. 6 was a ""normal tourist visit"" are Pants on Fire, and the longest sentence handed down to date was for 63 months.Â  Throughout his video, the Salty Cracker claimed that Babbitt was trying to stop antifa activists in disguise ""who were breaking into the f------ Speakerâ€™s Lobby over here, and then got shot.""Â  Hereâ€™s how he described what happened before her death: ""All of the Trump supporters (were) trying to stop these people from breaking windows, trying to stop these people from setting the place on fire. Donald Trump supporters trying to extinguish the false flag, and apparently Ashli Babbitt was one of these individuals, and we got it on tape â€¦ As sheâ€™s trying to stop them, then they start chasing her. So then sheâ€™s got to climb through. She canâ€™t go backwards, so sheâ€™s got to go forward."" But several rioters denied the antifa rumors themselves in social media posts and messages. PolitiFact rated the claim that antifa provoked Babbittâ€™s shooting Pants on Fire, one of the many falsehoods about the Jan. 6 attack that merited PolitiFactâ€™s 2021 Lie of the Year designation. RELATED VIDEOÂ  ""We have no cases of antifa in our database of individuals charged with breaking into the Capitol,"" said Roderick Cowan, the executive director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, which maintains a database on the more than 700 people facing charges. ""Nor have we ever seen evidence of a named individual who supports antifa there."" Among the rioters nearby when Babbitt died were Zachary Alam, the rioter wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat who smashed the windows to the Speakerâ€™s Lobby that Babbitt later climbed through; Chad Barrett Jones, who helped bust the glass with a rolled-up Trump flag; and Thomas Baranyi, who wore a Trump-Pence hat and left the Capitol with Babbittâ€™s blood smeared on his hand. But what about the pro-Trump mob? Was Babbitt trying to fend those rioters off?Â  Throughout his video, the Salty Cracker read from an article in the Epoch Times, a pro-Trump outlet, with the headline: ""Babbitt tried to stop attack on Capitol Speakerâ€™s Lobby, video shows."" The article largely ignored the actions that prompted Babbittâ€™s fatal shooting, when she tried to push through the window to the Speakerâ€™s Lobby. In an interview after the riot, Baranyi said the police were warning her to stop, but that ""she didnâ€™t heed the call."" The article instead focused on the buildup to that moment, claiming that the footage captured by those who were there, when slowed down, showed Babbitt trying ""to prevent the attack, not join it."" Some of that footage came from John Sullivan, an activist controversial on both sides of the political spectrum, whose presence fueled the antifa falsehood, and who faces several charges. The Epoch Timesâ€™ evidence for its assertion: that Babbitt had ""looks of shock and concern"" on her face; that she was ""so distressed at the violence, she jumped up and down in frustration""; that she ""confronted"" Alam before he punched the window she later climbed through; that she winced at his punch; that and she at one point shouted, ""Stop! No! Donâ€™t! Wait!"" Those claims are speculative and unsubstantiated. Videos of the incident do not clearly capture all that Babbitt was saying and doing, let alone feeling, at the time. Whether Babbitt was feeling shocked and concerned, and whether she was jumping because she was frustrated, is also a matter of interpretation.Â  Other footage from Tayler Hansen, a self-described ""independent journalist"" whose Twitter account includes statements of support for conservative causes, shows Babbitt leaning toward Alam and appearing to say something. But itâ€™s not clear that she was confronting him. Experts in multimedia forensics told PolitiFact itâ€™s nearly impossible to discern from Sullivanâ€™s video what Babbitt was saying. Sheâ€™s far away from Sullivanâ€™s microphone in a loud room with many people shouting, making it difficult to attribute speech directly to her.Â  ""This is a classic â€˜cocktail party effectâ€™ recording of an unknown number of speakers, overlapped, speaking loud,"" said Catalin Grigoras, director of the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado, Denver. Grigoras and other experts said the science available to experts would likely be unable to isolate Babbittâ€™s voice from Sullivanâ€™s video. One rioter recalled for investigators that Babbitt said something along the lines of, ""Just open the door. Theyâ€™re not gonna stop."" And another video recorded by Hansen showed Babbitt shouting at the officers. (Itâ€™s not clear what Babbitt is saying in that clip, either, experts said.)  Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier on Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP) The Epoch Times article also quoted from Hansen and Babbittâ€™s husband, Aaron Babbitt. Hansen told the Epoch Times that Babbitt was ""literally trapped"" in a corner. Aaron Babbitt said she climbed through the window because she feared for her life and wanted to escape. But Hansenâ€™s video shows that Babbitt was the first to reach the doors leading to the Speakerâ€™s Lobby. Footage shows her not pinned but moving freely prior to the incident..Â  A YouTube video claimed, ""Ashli Babbitt tried to stop antifa false flag on Jan. 6."" The video was posted by a creator whose website includes a disclaimer saying his opinions are meant ""for entertainment purposes only and are probably wrong.""Â  In this case, the videoâ€™s central claim that Babbitt was fighting to thwart an antifa false flag is a ridiculous rewriting of what happened inside the Capitol. Babbitt was shot as she attempted to climb through the shattered window of a door leading to the Speakerâ€™s Lobby.Â  There was no documented trace of antifa involvement at the Capitol or in her shooting, and the suggestion that Babbitt was trying to stop the mobâ€™s advances was based largely on speculation about what she was doing, saying and feeling in the moments leading up to her death.

Vaccines keep people out of the hospital. A viral image of Israeli COVID-19 cases ignores that.
","On TikTok and Twitter, opponents of the COVID-19 vaccines have been sharing a table that they claim shows how ineffective vaccines are. One TikTokker, writing in a style designed to thwart efforts to block misinformation, used the table in her video. ""86% of N0VID [emailÂ protected] in Israel were FULLY you-know-whatted in July!!!!,"" the post said. TikTok identified this video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading, or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) We found the table had been shared in several web posts, and in response to a tweet by Candace Owens, a conservative pundit and vaccine skeptic. Along with the table, the Twitter respondent wrote, ""How about 15,634 cases among the fully vaccinated only in July?"" The table is misleading in several respects. It cherry-picks its age groups; it doesnâ€™t understand what the unvaccinated category means; and, above all, it obscures that unvaccinated people account for two-thirds of the serious cases in Israel. Those are the cases that kill. Letâ€™s take a closer look at the table.Â Â  The table relies on public data to show the number of cases of COVID-19 in Israel in the month of July 2021. For people 20 and older, cases among those who had been vaccinated far outnumber those who had not been vaccinated. According to these numbers, vaccinated people account for 86% of all cases in July. Its first error is it ignores cases for people under 20. The original data from Israelâ€™s Ministry of Health includes them. Add those in and the totals become 16,701 cases among the vaccinated, and 13,918 among the unvaccinated. There are still more cases among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated, but the fraction is about 55% of the total, not the more dramatic 86% as claimed. The next issue is more significant â€” the unvaccinated cases represented in this table include people who had been infected earlier. ""Given we have tons of papers showing how previous infection provides substantial protection against reinfection, failure to remove these from the unvaccinated skews the results in that table,"" said Jeffrey Morris, a University of Pennsylvania biostatistician. In September, among the 20- to 59-year-olds, one-third of the unvaccinated were previously infected. What seems like a comparison between vaccine and no-vaccine cases is actually a comparison between vaccine and a blend of no-vaccine and previously-infected cases â€” not at all the same thing. On top of that, the table ignores that with nearly 80% of the Israeli population vaccinated, the number of people vaccinated far outnumbers the unvaccinated. Itâ€™s basic math. If a small percentage of the larger group catch the virus, the raw number can be bigger than if a large percentage of the much smaller group of unvaccinated people catch it. The most important flaw in the table is it counts all reported cases, when the real threat is serious cases. Many cases are asymptomatic. A fever, even a wracking cough, that keeps you home for a week is a very different health event than a severe case of COVID-19 that sends you to the hospital because you canâ€™t breathe.Â  Morris ran the numbers from Israel in August as the delta variant took hold. The data showed that for people under 50, unvaccinated Israelis were over 10 times more likely to end up in the hospital than who were fully vaccinated. Among people over 50, the risk jumped to over 20 times more likely. Research shows that the delta variant emerged as the vaccines began to wear off. Preliminary data from Israel showed that breakthrough infections became increasingly more common with each passing month. The delta variant is much more infectious, and more likely to overwhelm a personâ€™s immune response. But the numbers show that even with the impact of delta, the vaccines still kept many people out of the hospital. A TikTok video used a table of Israel COVID-19 cases to say 86% cases in July were in fully vaccinated individuals. The table cherry-picks age-group data to come up with an artificially high percentage of cases from vaccinated Israelis. It omits cases among teenagers and children, and ignores that about a third of the unvaccinated Israelis enjoy some immunity from a previous infection. Gaining immunity through infection is much riskier than being vaccinated.Â  The greatest flaw is it focuses on cases, the least important measure of the threat posed by COVID-19. The real danger lies in serious cases, and by that measure, the unvaccinated are 10 to 20 times more at risk. The video diverts attention from the actual health threat.Â  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809679FF80>],/factchecks/2021/oct/05/tiktok-posts/vaccines-keep-people-out-hospital-viral-image-isra/

Wisconsin Gov. Evers tweaks his stance on repealing business tax
","On July 8, 2021, Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a Republican-backed bill to eliminate the personal property tax, which is levied on businesses for their equipment and furniture. Businesses are against the tax because of its cost and because of the paperwork required to comply with it. Two months after the veto, on Sept. 22, 2021, Democrat Evers endorsed a Democrat-backed bill to eliminate the very same tax. So, the governor now backs a bill to eliminate a more than 170-year-old tax, after earlier vetoing a measure eliminating the tax.Â  Republicans quickly tagged Evers as a flip-flopper, or at best being hypocritical, since he already had a prime chance to achieve the goal -- an extreme rarity in this period of headbutting with the Republican Legislature. That prompted us to turn to the Flip-O-Meter, and with it our requisite reminder: We are examining whether a politician has been consistent over time, not whether any change is good policy or good politics. In this case, itâ€™s more complicated than it seems. Evers does not have a long history with the personal property tax. For instance, he did not campaign in 2018 on eliminating it -- as he did on cutting taxes for the middle class. And Republicans did not put bills to eliminate the tax on his desk in the first years of his term.Â  So, our evidence is largely the debate around this single bill, which was sent to Evers in tandem with the state budget for 2021-23. Thanks to a windfall of $4.4 billion in unexpected revenue, Republicans were able to approve a budget that included more than $2 billion in tax cuts, primarily by reducing the state income tax. Evers, for his part, said that tax cut was not perfect -- he wanted it to be more progressive, offering more relief to lower wage earners. But he still signed the budget, he immediately touted that imperfect tax cut as fulfilling a major campaign promise. On the business-related tax, Evers took a different approach. And that factors into our analysis here. Getting rid of the personal property tax would save businesses â€” and cost the state â€” an estimated $245 million a year. Unlike some other measures that have landed on Eversâ€™ desk, this one included some back-and-forth beforehand, between Eversâ€™ Department of Revenue and a business-focused group called the Coalition to Repeal Wisconsinâ€™s Personal Property Tax and, notably, state Sen. Duey Strobel, R-Saukville, lead author of the bill in question. According to Stroebel, the final bill included virtually all changes requested by the Department of Revenue, in addition to more requested changes received only hours before the bill was taken up in the Assembly.Â  When Republicans sent their bill to Evers, they included in the state budget more than $200 million to provide local governments with payments to cover revenue losses that would be caused by ending the state-imposed tax.Â  Evers vetoed repeal of the tax, but retained that extra money in the budget saying it could be used to buffer a future repeal of the tax. In his veto message, Evers wrote:Â  ""I am vetoing this bill because I object to the unusual and haphazard process by which the Legislature pursued the repeal of the personal property tax.""Â  He also argued that Republicans wrote the measure in a way that could have resulted in an additional tax break for utilities, and called on lawmakers to address the issue and pass a new repeal bill that addressed his concerns.Â  That has not happened. Instead, Evers lined up with Democrats to introduce their own bill.Â  Stroebel said the new repeal bill was crafted without any consultation, and included ""poison pill provisions to appease the left and serve as political cover for those not paying attention."" That bill is more than twice as long as the Republican bill, as Democrats are trying to spell out exactly how various businesses would be treated under a repeal. In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Patty Mayers, communications director for the revenue department, said the bill ""carefully seeks to ensure that there are no unintended consequences from elimination of the personal property tax.""Â  Among other things, she noted it included a built-in inflationary increase for local governments, and said the new measure ""seeks to ensure the Transportation Fund does not bear the cost of lost railroad personal property tax collections."" Thatâ€™s fair. No one would expect the new bill to exactly match the old. But thatâ€™s not the question at hand for us: We are more interested in whether the new bill matches what Evers said he wanted in a new bill when he vetoed the first one. In that regard, there are differences worth noting. For instance, the repeal coalition says the new bill ""singles out both recreational mobile homes and outdoor advertising signs and would require them to continue to be taxed"" and exempts air carriers from real estate property taxes -- which is a different tax entirely. Stroebel described it as ""a completely unrelated, brand new special interest property tax exemption â€¦ added for air carriers."" So, whatâ€™s the bottom line? Evers has been consistent on saying he wants the tax repealed, but much less consistent on what it would take for him to sign the measure. There were several new things added subsequent to his veto message. And the entire approach -- especially in divided Madison -- stands in contrast to how he handled the income tax cut in the state budget, which Evers noted was not perfect in his mind, but went a long way toward achieving his goals. Because of that inconsistency, we rate this a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C15C800>],/factchecks/2021/oct/05/tony-evers/wisconsin-gov-evers-tweaks-his-stance-repealing-bu/

Biden-backed infrastructure bill doesnâ€™t contain 3% property tax
","President Joe Bidenâ€™s Build Back Better agenda features an array of policies that would touch on everything from climate change to healthcare. One thing it wouldnâ€™t do is establish a universal federal property tax. Nevertheless, social media users claimed there is a provision buried deep in the infrastructure bill that would do just that.Â  ""This â€˜infrastructure billâ€™ on page 2,385 presents a federal property tax of 3 percent on all homes and land - both residential and commercial,"" reads an image posted to Facebook.Â  The image was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact spoke to three tax experts who have reviewed both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Build Back Better Act. They were unanimous: Bidenâ€™s infrastructure agenda doesnâ€™t contain a 3% property tax, or any federal property tax at all.Â  ""This claim is not true,"" said Garrett Watson, a senior tax policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.Â  The image cites ""page 2,385"" of the infrastructure bill as evidence for its claims. However, page 2,385 of that bill would provide state funds to establish a ferry service for rural communities, not levy a property tax.Â  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ""doesnâ€™t contain much in the way of tax changes,"" said Gordon Mermin, a principal research associate in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. As evidence, he pointed to a bipartisan overview ofÂ tax provisions in the bill, none of which resemble a federal property tax.Â  Itâ€™s possible that the claim refers to the Build Back Better Act, the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that would fight climate change and widen the social safety net, where Democrats have stuck most of their tax proposals. However, page 2,385 of the Build Back Better Act relates to drug pricing proposals, not a property tax.Â  Finally, a federal property tax would be ""very difficult to pull off absent a constitutional amendment,"" said Erica York, an economist at the Tax Foundation.Â  The U.S. Constitution requires that any direct federal tax be apportioned among the states. In other words, a tax would have to be the same amount per person in every state in order to be constitutional, which ""would be very hard to do with a property tax that is levied based on property values,"" said Watson.Â  ""If (a federal property tax) is 3% of the value of land, it will never be the same per person in any two states, let alone all fifty,"" said Steven J. Willis, a tax law professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.Â  According to the National Constitution Center, arguably the only way the federal government could levy a direct property tax would be to designate a fixed amount per person, since this tax would stay the same per capita in every state. The federal government has never imposed a tax of this kind before.Â  Last year before the 2020 election, false claims about Biden imposing a 3% property tax spread widely despite the fact that nothing in his tax plan indicated this. Facebook posts claim that the ""â€˜infrastructure billâ€™ on page 2385 presents a federal property tax of 3% on all homes and land - both residential and commercial."" Three tax policy experts who have extensively reviewed the Biden infrastructure agenda said the claim was inaccurate.Â  Pages 2,385 in both the Build Back Better Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act donâ€™t mention a federal property tax.Â  A direct federal property tax as described in the post would be very difficult to make constitutional.Â  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028097085CC0>],/factchecks/2021/oct/04/facebook-posts/infrastructure-bill-doesnt-contain-3-property-tax/

Fact-check: How many undocumented Canadians live in the U.S.?
","U.S. Rep. Cori Bush said the treatment of Haitians at the U.S. border is not about immigration but something more sinister â€” and she shared a statistic about ourÂ North American neighbors to the north as evidence. ""Approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA,"" tweeted Bush, a Missouri Democrat, Sept. 23. ""You donâ€™t see the militarized presence, cops on horseback, and calls for a wall on that border. The issue has never been about immigration. Itâ€™s about anti-Blackness and racism."" Bushâ€™s criticism came as the Biden administration dealt with fallout from its handling of thousands of Haitian migrants who in September crossed the border illegally into Texas. Images and videos of Border Patrol agents pursuing the migrants prompted outcry from some within Bidenâ€™s party, as did the administrationâ€™s decision to expel thousands. For decades, the U.S. governmentâ€™s treatment of refugees has varied greatly depending on where they are from. An Associated Press analysis of asylum data, for example, found that from October 2018 through June 2021 Haitians were granted asylum at the lowest rate of any nationality. We wanted to know if Bush was right about the number of undocumented Canadians in the U.S. We found that her statistic is in the ballpark of some available data, but the data lacks precision. Bushâ€™s congressional office declined to comment since she tweeted from her personal account. Her campaign did not respond to our query. There is no exact science for calculating the size of the unauthorized population in the United States.We reached out to nonpartisan experts and found that while their estimates vary, they tend to be in the same ballpark.Â Â  The Migration Policy Institute estimates that ""approximately 57,000 unauthorized immigrants from Canada resided in the United States as of 2018, accounting for less than 1% of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country.""Â  Some of the largest pockets of unauthorized immigrants from Canada were in Los Angeles, the Boston area, Floridaâ€™s Broward County, Arizonaâ€™s Maricopa County, and Washington stateâ€™s King County, the Migration Policy Institute found.Â  The Pew Research Center estimated that in 2017 there were about 80,000 unauthorized immigrants from Canada. That estimate had a margin of error of +/- 15,000, which puts it in the same ballpark as the Migration Policy Institute number. The number of unauthorized immigrants from Canada has been dropping steadily in recent years, said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at Pew.Â  For unauthorized Canadians, ""a figure of 60,000 for today is roughly consistent with the findings of our research,"" Passel said. Robert Warren, a senior fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, estimated that in 2019 the undocumented Canadian population in the U.S. was 32,000. Warren is a former longtime demographer for the U.S. Census Bureau and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. None of these estimates rely on post-COVID era data, so they do not reflect a snapshot of what has happened during a period when it has been more difficult to cross the U.S. border. The Department of Homeland Security releases annual reports on the number of foreign visitors who came to the U.S. legally, but stayed beyond the time period for which their admission had been authorized. These visitors are referred to as ""visa overstayers,"" although Canadians generally donâ€™t require a visa to visit the U.S. for a few months. Ravi Jain, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer who is also licensed to practice law in Massachusetts, told us that undocumented Canadians in the U.S. are often looking for work, some as models, actors and singers. When they get a gig, they stay. Sometimes they find a romantic partner in the U.S. and ""just just donâ€™t file the paperwork timely, too."" The Homeland Security overstay report for 2019 showed out of about 10 million expected departures, there were about 84,000 ""suspected"" Canadian overstayers. The overstay estimates available could be inflated. Â ""To give a concrete exampleâ€¦You have a temporary visa that calls for you to leave the U.S. on Sept. 28 but you leave on Oct. 2. You will be counted as a â€˜suspected in-county overstayâ€™ as of the end of the fiscal year (Sept. 30) even though you have left the country,"" Passel said.Â  Bush tweeted that ""approximately 60,000 Canadians currently live undocumented in the USA."" Itâ€™s difficult to pinpoint a precise count of undocumented Canadians, but Bushâ€™s number is in the ballpark of data by experts including those at the Migration Policy Institute and the Pew Research Center.

No proof for lawmakerâ€™s claim that 75% of Illinois Republicans are vaccinated against COVID
","Over the past few months, national surveys have found Republicans are one of the demographic groups least likely to report being vaccinated against COVID-19. A state senator from southern Illinois says Republicans throughout the state are bucking that trend. In response to a Democratic Governors Association ad calling the current Illinois GOP gubernatorial candidates ""anti-science,"" state Sen. Terri Bryant, a Republican from Murphysboro, claimed the vast majority of Illinois Republicans are vaccinated. ""I'm still trying to get some of the folks that travel down that line who want to basically say that Republicans are anti-vaccine and anti-science to explain that to me, because I believe right now that 75% of Republicans have been vaccinated in this state,"" Bryant said in radio interview with WJPF. She added that she and her husband have both received the COVID-19 vaccine. Bryant contrasted her figure with the fact that fewer than half of Black residents in predominantly Democratic Chicago are vaccinated. The low vaccination rate among Black Chicagoans has been well-documented in news reports and is a focus of the cityâ€™s in-home vaccination program. For this fact-check, we decided to focus on the claim that three-quarters of Illinois Republicans are vaccinated, because we hadn't heard that before. We contacted polling experts, surveyed news coverage and reviewed state data, but found no evidence to back up Bryantâ€™s claim. We also left multiple messages with the senatorâ€™s district office seeking comment, which she did not return. On the day Bryant made her claim, 62% of Illinois residents age 12 and older had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to Illinois Department of Public Health data. If Bryant were correct, that would mean Republicans are outperforming the stateâ€™s average. National polls, however, show Republicans trailing other demographic groups â€” including both Democrats and Black Americans â€” when it comes to getting vaccinated. An NBC News poll released Aug. 22 found 55% of Republicans nationwide said theyâ€™ve already been vaccinated, compared with 88% of Democrats and 76% of Black adults â€” a higher rate than white respondents overall. Trump voters came in even lower, at 50%. Similarly, a Pew Research survey conducted in late August found 60% of Republican or Republican-leaning adults reported receiving at least one dose of the vaccine compared with 86% of Democrats. Unlike earlier in the pandemic, Black and white adults were about equally likely to say theyâ€™d been vaccinated, according to Pew. And most recently, the Kaiser Family Foundation released the September findings of its COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor project. ""The largest remaining gap in vaccination rates is by partisanship, with 90% of Democrats saying they have gotten at least one dose compared to 68% of independents and 58% of Republicans,"" that report noted. Republicans were also the demographic group most likely to say they would definitely not get the vaccine, KFF found. Another way to approximate vaccine uptake by political party is to compare vaccination rates between counties that voted Democratic in the last election versus those that went Republican. As of Sept. 13, according to KFF, nearly 53% of people in counties that voted for President Joe Biden were fully vaccinated, compared with roughly 40% of those in counties that voted for former President Donald Trump nationwide. We analyzed IDPH county-level data for Sept. 24 and Sept. 28 and found a similar gap of around 12 percentage points for Illinois. Bryant said ""75% of Republicans have been vaccinated"" against COVID-19 in Illinois. The state senator did not respond to our inquiries asking for evidence to back up her claim, and we could find no surveys or studies that show she is correct. None of the state polling experts we contacted told us they had seen data showing how many Illinois Republicans have been vaccinated either. State and national trends suggest that the claim is not accurate. The figure Bryant cited is higher than Illinoisâ€™ overall vaccination rate and is out of line with multiple national surveys conducted over the past two months that find Republicans are one of the demographic groups least likely to have taken the vaccine. Illinois counties that voted for Trump in 2020 also have a lower average vaccination rate than counties that Biden won, state data show. We rate Bryantâ€™s claim False.

Report shares wildly unfounded claims on COVID-19 vaccine
","A 52-page report from a pair of anti-vaccine advocates claims to present the truth about COVID-19 vaccines. However, it does just the opposite. The website Stop World Control published the so-called Vaccine Death Report in September 2021,Â and it was shared across Facebook, including in this Sept. 26 post. It is written by David Sorenson and Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, a New York doctor who made headlines for prescribing hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 even though health authorities cautioned against it. The report claims that ""millions have died from COVID injections"" around the world, and includes narratives from the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and Brazil to back up this claim. On top of that, it claims that half a million people within the United States have suffered severe side effects such as strokes, heart failure, brain disorders, convulsions and more. ""The data shows that we are currently witnessing the greatest organized mass murder in the history of our world,"" the report states.Â  The alarming findings cite databases like the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and others. But the report misinterpreted the data to draw unfounded conclusions about the vaccines. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, also called VAERS, is an official public government database where anyone can submit any potential adverse health effect following a vaccine. However, the reports are not verified, and the system itself warns that reports can contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental or unverifiable. When used improperly, VAERS can be a source for misinformation. Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not verified any deaths as a result of the vaccines approved in the United States. Researchers are still evaluating whether there is a connection between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare types of blood clots, but such cases are few.Â  More than 390 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the U.S., with 55.6% of Americans fully vaccinated. CDC spokesperson Martha Sharan said the FDA requires health care providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if itâ€™s unclear if the vaccine was the cause. The CDC states that VAERS has received 8,164 reports of deaths following a vaccine, or 0.0021%. Thatâ€™s far lower than the claims from the vaccine death report. However, thatâ€™s still unsubstantiated given that VAERS reports do not conclude if a vaccine caused an adverse event. More evidence is needed. Sharan said that serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are ""extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination(s)."" ""COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective,"" she said. ""COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met the (FDAâ€™s) rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support approval or authorization of a vaccine."" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration told Reuters that under reporting is a limitation in VAERS in regards to COVID-19 vaccines, but ""there currently is not evidence to suggest it would underestimate the amount of COVID-19 vaccine-related deaths to such a large degree.""Â  Outside of the U.S. the report on Stop World Control cites other sources like EudraVigilance, the European database counterpart to VAERS. The report states that according to EudraVigilance, 22,000 people died from vaccines and 2 million suffered adverse events â€” but the database itself warns that its information contains ""suspected side effects"" that may not have been caused by the medicine. ""Only a detailed evaluation and scientific assessment of all available data allows for robust conclusions to be drawn on the benefits and risks of a medicine,"" the system states. The death report includes narratives from Facebook users and people from around the world who claim that they or someone they knew died or suffered serious adverse events from the COVID-19 vaccines. These narratives do not provide context or substantial evidence to back up these claims.Â  Â  A report written by anti-vaccine advocates on a website called Stop World Control made claims that the COVID-19 vaccine has killed millions of people.Â  This report cites sources such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, an official database to which anyone can report any kind of adverse health event following a vaccine. VAERS reports are not analyzed for accuracy, and may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate or coincidental. Europeâ€™s EudraVigilance is a similar system to VAERS and issues the same warning about its own reports. No credible source suggests that millions of people have died from vaccines.Â  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C29FC0>],/factchecks/2021/oct/01/blog-posting/report-shares-wildly-unfounded-claims-covid-19-vac/

A redacted ingredient of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is just water
","An Instagram post claimedÂ the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer contains an undisclosed mystery ingredient, even though the full ingredient list has been available online since December 2020. The Sept. 20 post shows a table from the federal Food and Drug Administration titled ""composition of COMIRNATY Multiple Dose Vial."" Comirnaty is Pfizerâ€™s brand name for its COVID-19 vaccine. The table shows the different ingredients that make up the vaccine, according to the Instagram post. However, one of the listed ingredients, described as an excipient, is redacted.Â  The caption on the post claimed the excipient, a type of inert substance that acts as a vehicle for a drug, makes up 20% of the vaccine and could potentially make up 20% of each dose. ""The undisclosed ingredient is also not disclosed in the vaccine package insert,"" the post said. ""If the American people don't know the identity of an ingredient in an FDA-approved vaccine, how is informed consent possible?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although not all the ingredients of the vaccine were shown in that FDA document, the ingredients of the vaccine are not undisclosed. They have been public since the vaccines came out. The table featured in the post comes from the FDA as part of a summary report explaining its decision to give final approval to the vaccine. The report includes the studies conducted on the vaccine and an ingredient list. Although an earlier version of the report had one ingredient redacted, as shown in the Instagram post, the FDA updated the report since the post, removing the redaction. The formerly redacted ingredient is listed as ""water for injection."" (A Sept. 30 update to the Instagram post acknowledged the change.) Pfizerâ€™s vaccine is distributed in vials of a frozen suspension that must be thawed and diluted with a sterile saline solution of a certain concentration to produce several injectable doses. The table on the FDA report lists the ingredients and their amounts ""after dilution.""Â  The package insert for the vaccine lists the ingredients of the suspension and includes the dilution instructions: ""Dilute the vial contents using 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to form COMIRNATY. Do not add more than 1.8 mL of diluent."" The insert also details the clinical trials on the vaccine and their findings. Redactions do occur in FDA reports, and are usually for information thatâ€™s considered a confidential or trade secret, said Alison Hunt, a press officer for the FDA. The FDA report on Pfizerâ€™s vaccine still has some redacted information, but Pfizer says it involves ""proprietary pieces of the lipid nanoparticle that makes it unique"" to the company. Lipid nanoparticles are a type of fatty material that helps transport the vaccine's active ingredient into a person's cells. Claims that the COVID-19 vaccines contain mysterious or harmful ingredients are not new. They have been checked several times by PolitiFact, and rated False. The ingredients list for the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have been available online from the FDA, without redactions, since the vaccines became publicly available. An Instagram post claimedÂ the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine contains an undisclosed ingredient. The post cited an FDA report in which one of the ingredients listed was redacted. The agency has since updated the file and revealed that the ingredient was water. Long before the FDA report, the ingredients of the Pfizer vaccine, as well as ones for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, were made public online, without any redactions.

Claim that vaccine campaign boosted COVID-19 deaths errs in several ways
","A viral image that alleges that vaccines have caused a 175% increase in COVID-19 deaths ignores the outsize impact of the virus on the unvaccinated, as well as the large and growing body of evidence that vaccines substantially reduce the likelihood of death. The image, titled ""U.S. pandemic outcomes,"" cites figures indicating that the seven-day average of COVID-19 deaths was more than twice as high on Sept. 28, 2021, as it was on the same date in 2020, when there werenâ€™t yet any vaccines. ""The v campaign,"" the image concludes, referring to vaccinations, ""increased C-19 deaths"" by 175%. The image, shared on Instagram, was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Â Some social media users avoid spelling out words like ""vaccine,"" ""shot"" or ""COVID-19"" to evade detection by fact-checkers. The post makes several errors: First, it cherry-picks two data points without examining the trends in between. Second, it fails to account for the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases for each period, which affects the case fatality rate. Third, it attributes the difference in the death totals to the vaccine campaign, without providing any evidence to support that conclusion. Fourth, it fails to account for the vaccination status of the people who died in 2021. Fifth, it ignores scientific evidence that vaccination reduces the risks of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Figures from credible sources differ from whatâ€™s in the Instagram post, but they show that the seven-day average of COVID-19 deaths on Sept. 28, 2021, was just over double the number a year earlier.Â  The seven-day rolling average of confirmed COVID-19 deaths was 767 on Sept. 28, 2020; and 1,993 on Sept. 28, 2021, according to Our World in Data. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the figures were 652 in the 2020 period and 1,425 in 2021.Â  But those year-over-year comparisons are skewed: September 2020 was during a trough in overall COVID-19 cases, before a huge spike in cases and deaths that peaked in January 2021. September 2021, on the other hand, coincided with another spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to the emergence of the delta variant.Â  In between those spikes, the rolling average fell as low as 192 deaths, as the vaccines became more widely available.Â  COVID-19 has killed nearly 700,000 people in the U.S. and about 4.8 million worldwide. The vaccines authorized in the U.S. have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. As of Sept. 20, 2021, more than 181 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated and there were 4,493 breakthrough infections in which the person died, according to the CDC. That comes out to 0.002%. Of those, 86% were people above age 65, and 19% were people who didnâ€™t have COVID-19 symptoms or whose death was not COVID-related. The CDC reported on Sept. 10 that, based on a study of more than 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states from April through mid-July, unvaccinated people were 11 times more likely to die than vaccinated people. There is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S. Researchers are still evaluating whether there is a connection between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare types of blood clots that have led to deaths, but such cases are few. Hereâ€™s what the CDC says about deaths occurring after vaccination: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires health care providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, jointly run by the CDC and the FDA, even if itâ€™s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.Â  More than 390 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Sept. 27, 2021. In that period, VAERS received 8,164 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.Â  ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" A viral image claimed that ""the vaccination campaign"" increased COVID-19 deaths by 175% in one year. It reaches that conclusion by comparing death figures for Sept. 28, 2021, and the same day a year earlier, before vaccines were available. The claim uses a flawed comparison to reach a conclusion for which it provides no evidence. According to the CDC, unvaccinated people are 11 times more likely to die from COVID-19, and no evidence has established that the COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths.

Biden hasnâ€™t ordered dishonorable discharges for vaccine refusers in military, as viral post claimed
","A new rumor on social media falsely claimed that President Joe Biden commanded the military to dishonorably discharge service members who reject the Pentagonâ€™s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Thatâ€™s not true. In reality, Biden gave no such direction, and legal experts said he wouldnâ€™t have the authority to do so. But various posts claiming otherwise garnered thousands of engagements on Instagram. ""Biden orders dishonorable discharge for 46% of troops who refuse vaccine,"" said the Instagram posts, which shared screenshots of a Sept. 23 headline from a blog site called ""Sandra Rose."" The posts were flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Â  Asked whether Biden had issued such a directive, the White House referred PolitiFact to the Pentagon, which offered a simple rebuttal: ""Regarding the claim on Instagram, that is false.""  Instagram posts like this oneÂ from Sept. 27Â falsely claimed that President Joe Biden ordered dishonorable discharges for all service members who refused to comply withÂ the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Several branches of the military separately confirmed that they had not received a White House order like the Instagram posts described. ""President Biden has not ordered the Coast Guard to dishonorably discharge Coast Guard members who refuse the COVID-19 vaccine,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Kroll, chief of media relations for the Coast Guard, in one such statement. There are several types of discharge service members can face, military experts said. From best to worst, the options include honorable discharges; general discharges under honorable conditions; other than honorable discharges; bad conduct discharges; and dishonorable discharges. The first three occur at the administrative level. But the latter two must be handed down by a court martial, experts said, so Biden does not have authority to order them. ""Under decades-old federal law, a dishonorable discharge can only be given to a service member who has been convicted by a general court-martial,"" said Dwight Stirling, founder and CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy, a think tank, and a lecturer in law at the University of Southern California. Richard Rosen, a law professor and director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University, said those who shared the Instagram posts may have been confused by reports that the Biden administration opposed a recent legislative proposal that would prohibit military leaders from dishonorably discharging service members who rebuff the vaccine mandate. In response to PolitiFactâ€™s inquiry, the account behind one Instagram post, which got nearly 5,000 likes, pointed to an article from Fox News about exactly that. The Office of Management and Budget said in a Sept. 21 statement of administration policy that the administration ""strongly oppose(d)"" the provision, which was written as an amendment to the defense spending bill for the 2022 fiscal year. The statement that such legislation ""would detract from readiness and limit a commanderâ€™s options for enforcing good order and discipline when a service member fails to obey a lawful order to receive a vaccination."" But the administrationâ€™s opposition to such legislation is ""not the same thing as the president directing a dishonorable discharge,"" Rosen said. The branches of the military set up different timelines for getting troops vaccinated. According to the Military Times, the Armyâ€™s active-duty troops have until Dec. 15, while the Air Force and Space Force set Nov. 2 as their deadline, and the Marine Corps and Navy picked Nov. 28.Â  Service members can request exemptions for medical and religious reasons. How each branch will handle those who refuse the shots remains to be seen, but some branches have telegraphed their intentions. The Army, for example, has said that while hesitant soldiers will initially receive counseling, ""continued failure to comply could result in administrative or non-judicial punishment â€” to include relief of duties or discharge."" ""Taking the vaccine is a requirement, and again, I'll just leave it at that,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Congress Sept. 28. It is legally possible for service members who refuse the vaccine to be dishonorably discharged, Rosen said, though it would require a trial, with all the rights attendant to a criminal proceeding. Stirling said a dishonorable discharge is akin to a felony conviction, and that itâ€™s more likely these troops would face an administrative response, which could include a written reprimand, a comment in a performance evaluation, a demotion, or one of the less severe forms of discharge.Â  The Instagram postâ€™s claim about ""46% of troops"" refusing the vaccine came from the Sandra Rose blog post, which said that 600,000 out of the more than 1.3 million active-duty service members had ""declined to roll up their sleeves."" Those numbers arenâ€™t accurate. According to June data from the Pentagon, the U.S. employs almost 1.38 million active-duty troops, plus nearly 800,000 National Guard and reserves. Itâ€™s roughly 2.18 million in total. The Pentagon data shows that as of Sept. 29, 1.28 million active-duty, National Guard and reserve troops had been fully vaccinated, and 384,824 had been partially vaccinated. That means that about 76% were fully or partially vaccinated, and about 59% were fully vaccinated. It also means that closer to 24% had received no vaccine.Â  Maj. Charlie Dietz, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, told PolitiFact that as of Oct. 1, about 95% of active-duty troops had been fully or partially vaccinated.Â  Dietz said the militaryâ€™s vaccination rates have increased significantly following the mandate, and that he was unaware of anyone being discharged for refusing to comply. Instagram posts said, ""Biden orders dishonorable discharge for 46% of troops who refuse vaccine.""Â  Thereâ€™s no evidence that Biden has given any such direction, and experts on military law said he wouldnâ€™t have the legal authority to do so as president. The percentage of active-duty military service members who have been partially or fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is about 95%, and the deadlines are a month or more away.

No, back-up of cargo ships off Southern California coast not due to â€˜manufactured supply-chain haltâ€™
","A record-breaking number of cargo ships are anchored off the coast at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. But posts on social media are falsely claiming that these ships are deliberately being prevented from unloading their cargo.Â  People have been sharing images of the cargo freighters online and speculating why the ships are unable to dock and unload. In the posts and in the comments sections, people are worried about nationwide shortages in the coming months.Â Â  ""There are now 56 cargo freighters anchored off the coast of California from Oakland to Long Beach in what can only be considered a manufactured supply-chain halt,"" one postÂ reads.Â  ""Reports have stated there are over 1000 holding and the number is rising,"" another post claims. ""There [sic] are not being allowed to dock and unload.""Â  ""Probably a good idea to make sure you have enough supplies to last several weeks or a couple of months should the inevitable finally happen,"" a third post warns. ""They will sink the ships and crash the economy if it means bringing the people to their knees."" Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact Californiaâ€™s partnership with Facebook.)Â  Our ResearchÂ  The ports off the coast of Southern California are some of the busiest in the world, accounting for almost half of the imports into the United States. These ports have seen abnormally high numbers of cargo ships at anchor or drift waiting to unload their cargo since late 2019, when the coronavirus pandemic began.Â  On September 25, there were a record-breaking 161 vessels in port â€” the normal number of vessels in port before the pandemic was around 60, according to data from the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which operates the vessel traffic service for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.Â  Itâ€™s true that there is an abnormally high number of ships waiting to unload their cargo in Southern California. There are 140 total ships in port at the Los Angeles and Long Beach Ports, according to the Marine Exchangeâ€™s most recent figures. Most of these vessels are container ships waiting for a spot to open up in the docks so they can unload.Â  But this backup is not part of a ""manufactured supply chain halt"" or deliberate attempt to stop shipments like some people are claiming online.Â  Experts say that one of the biggest reasons for the pile-up in ships is a shift in consumer spending habits as folks spend more time at home.Â  ""Consumers have shifted their spending from services to goods during the pandemic, and supply chains are struggling to keep pace,"" said Jeffrey Michael, executive director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at University of the Pacific. ""The ports in Southern California are actually moving record levels of containers, but they havenâ€™t been able to keep up with increased demand. Shipping experts say that there is a peak customer order season that starts with back to school shopping in September and lasts through holidays in December. The ports can usually handle that surge in shipping containers coming to unload their cargo. But last year things were different due to COVID-related disruptions and labor shortages, according to Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California.Â  ""We had a peak season that was greater than normal a year ago and they haven't been able to clear it,"" Louttit said.Â  That means that the ports were already backed up when this yearâ€™s peak season arrived, and now more boats are coming in to deliver goods for this peak season, adding on to that back-up.Â  Whatâ€™s more, the increased capacities of modern shipping containers has further compounded the back-up of ships waiting because it takes more time and labor to unload all of the cargo.Â  ""The ships today are just huge, much bigger than they were 10 or 15 years ago. There's a lot more cargo per ship and they just haven't been able to catch up,"" louttit said. ""When you have more containers, more ships, you have less capacity in the goods movement system."" As for the claim that the boats are being told they cannot unload their cargo, Louttit says that is not accurate.Â  ""â€˜Allowedâ€™ would imply that there is some kind of entity saying you can't come in,"" Louttit said. ""Nobody's saying that. The port is just too jammed. All the docks or for all the cranes are full and everybody is working at the port capacity that they can.""Â  The only caveat, according to Louttit, has to do with the Covid safety protocols.Â  ""What has happened in some cases with Covid is if the crew has COVID, the captain of the port writes an order to the ship that says you are not allowed to enter port,"" Louttit says. ""You can either go drift, you can go anchor, but you have to do your quarantine.""Â  But these cases are a minority and not responsible for the larger back-up of ships, he said.Â Â  Experts say that supply-chain disruptions and some product shortages are to be expected due to the back-up, but do not think it is necessary for people to stock up on essential supplies.Â  ""There could be shortages of some goods as a result of unprecedented demand for certain goods and a supply and distribution system that has been unable to expand fast enough to meet it as Covid recovers,"" Michael said. ""I wouldnâ€™t recommend that people stock up so much as that they put in orders early and expect some delays in fulfillment and higher prices for some high-demand items."" Our Ruling Multiple posts on social media claim there are an abnormally high number of cargo ships anchored off of the California coast. The posts warn that this back-up of ships will lead to nationwide food and supply shortages.Â  Some of the posts also claim that the ships are ""not being allowed to dock and unload"" as part of a ""manufactured"" effort to disrupt the supply chain. It is true that there is a record-breaking number of ships at anchor in Southern California waiting to unload their cargo. But experts say that the back-up is being caused by labor shortages, holiday buying surges and other COVID-19 related issues.Â  It is false to claim that these vessels are being prevented from unloading their cargo as part of some effort to interrupt the national supply chain.Â  Experts say that supply-chain disruptions and some product shortages are to be expected as the world continues to navigate a global pandemic, but do not think it is necessary for people to stock up on essential supplies.Â  We rate this as Mostly False.

No, Manchin and Sinema donâ€™t vote with Republicans
","CNN hosts Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo donâ€™t see eye to eye on the political leanings of two key senators. During the transition between their shows, Cuomo mentioned Democratsâ€™ problem of finding unity. ""You also have two Republicans in the Democratic Party who are making problems for the Democrats, and thatâ€™s Manchin and Sinema,"" Lemon said Sept. 29. ""Thatâ€™s your opinion,"" Cuomo said. ""Theyâ€™re both Democrats."" ""Itâ€™s not an opinion. Just look at the way they vote,"" Lemon said. We looked at the way they vote. According to the latest tracking by FiveThirtyEight, they vote with President Joe Biden virtually all the time. For Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, 100% of his votes align with Biden and the Democrats. That includes razor-thin party-line votes on a $3.5 trillion budget resolution (50-49), expanding voting rights (50-50) and $1.9 trillion for COVID-19 relief (50-49). Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has a similar record. The one exception is that Sinema didnâ€™t cast a vote on establishing a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. That measure fell several votes short of the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. Though Lemon focused on voting, itâ€™s worth noting that on measures that have not come to a vote, Lemon has more evidence to support his case. Both Manchin and Sinema oppose changing the Senateâ€™s filibuster rule that allows a minority of 41 senators to block a bill. That position has stymied top Democratic priorities, including strengthening the federal role in overseeing elections. The battle of the moment is over the Democratsâ€™ reconciliation bill. Biden and a majority of Democrats back a $3.5 trillion proposal. That package faces opposition from a group of centrist Democrats in the House who face tough reelection races, but without Manchin and Sinema, the reconciliation bill has zero chance in the Senate. A reconciliation bill needs only a simple majority, and in a 50-50 Senate, every Democrat must be on board. Manchin issued a statement saying he canâ€™t support the $3.5 trillion measure. ""Spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs, when we canâ€™t even pay for the essential social programs, like Social Security and Medicare, is the definition of fiscal insanity,"" Manchin said Sept. 29. Sinema has said she, too, opposes a $3.5 trillion price tag, but reports of her ongoing discussions with Biden and his staff hint that she might have some flexibility. At the time Lemon and Cuomo had their exchange, she was still in the ""no"" column. The CNN press office told us that Lemon was having a light moment with Cuomo. Manchin and Sinema have heard these attacks before, including from Biden. In a June speech in Oklahoma, Biden alluded to them when he said there were ""two members of the Senate who voted more with my Republican friends"" than with him. The claim was inaccurate then, and still is. Lemon said that based on their voting records, Manchin and Sinema are Republicans. Both of them have voted with the Democrats essentially 100% of the time. But they have broken with their party over the immediate effort to pass a multi-trillion-dollar reconciliation bill, a top Democratic priority. And so far, they have opposed changes in the Senate filibuster rule, another key roadblock to the Democratic agenda.

Due to the fact that over 90% of Norwayâ€™s population over the age of 18 has had one shot and 84% have been fully vaccinated, the nation has successfully alleviated the burden to its healthcare system, he says.Â  Over the last week, Norway hospital systems have reported fewer than 15 COVID-19 hospitalizations per day.Â  As a result, Bukholm continued, the coronavirus should now be viewed as similar in danger to other respiratory diseases ""in Norway and in many countries that have good vaccine coverage."" Because most vaccinated people infected with the virus experience only mild, cold-like symptoms, ""the coronavirus â€¦ joins the ranks of other respiratory diseases such as colds and seasonal flu.""Â  ""This does not mean that illness from coronavirus and the seasonal flu are similar,"" the NIPH spokesperson told PolitiFact.

The Facebook post distorts what the ballot review had to say about those 86,391 voters. Arizona state Senate Republicans ordered a review of 2 million ballots in Maricopa County. The review found that Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County by about 45,000 votes. That number was virtually the same as the countyâ€™s official canvass. The Unite America First article refers to one of the findings in the report related to a database used by the Cyber Ninjas, the contractors hired to review the ballots. The Cyber Ninjas checked the file of voters against a commercial database called Melissa. The Cyber Ninjas found that 86,391 voters were not found in the Melissa database. But the report did not state that the voters donâ€™t exist. In fact, it said: ""it is expected that most if not all of these individuals are in fact real people with a limited public record and commercial presence.""Â  In an earlier section of the report, the Cyber Ninjas acknowledged that the database was incomplete, writing ""some error is expected within these results."" Greg Brown, vice president of global marketing at Melissa, told PolitiFact that the website uses many sources, including names from newspaper and magazine subscriptions, credit cards, and mortuary records to compile its Personator data tool.Â  ""Being absent from the Personator data tool is not an indicator that an individual does not exist,"" Brown said.â€¯Â  Brown estimated that their database covers about 80% of U.S. adults. Some people may have opted out of such services, such as law enforcement officials, or just kept a low profile. Election experts say that official government voter registration databases offer a better set of data for verifying votersÂ  than commercial databases.Â  Tammy Patrick, an expert on elections at the Democracy Fund and a former Maricopa County elections official, said some individuals could have many entries in a commercial database while others have none.Â  Â ""Some individuals may use names or information that does not align with their official (name) â€” a subscription to Cat Fancy for Princess Kitty Jefferson rather than the catâ€™s owner,"" Patrick said. ""Commercial data is not government data."" Arizona election officials take steps to update voter registration information by checking it against government databases. Arizona is a member of ERIC, a partnership of states that allows election officials to access data showing voters who have moved within their state or out of state, have died or have duplicate registrations.Â  Benny White, a Republican and longtime volunteer data analyst for the state Republican Party, previously told us that commercial databases are a flawed source for voter information. ""You have to use the official voter registration records maintained by county officials and the Secretary of State,"" White said. ""I have worked with the RNC database for a number of years, and that database, which they spend millions of dollars trying to keep current and complete, is almost unusable because it is not current and not complete."" A Facebook post said the ballot review in Maricopa County found 86,391 voters who ""donâ€™t appear to exist."" The GOP-orchestrated review of ballots in Maricopa County cast in the 2020 presidential election found that 86,391 voters were not found in a commercial database known as Melissa.Â  But the ballot review report did not declare that these voters donâ€™t exist. The report said, ""It is expected that most if not all of these individuals are in fact real people with a limited public record and commercial presence."" An official for Melissa estimated that their database covers 80% of adults and said that being absent from their data tool doesnâ€™t mean someone doesnâ€™t exist.

Drug Pfizer is studying for COVID-19 not â€˜suspiciously similarâ€™ to ivermectin
","Ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug sometimes used to treat horses, has not been proven effective as a treatment for COVID-19. Nevertheless, the Zero Hedge blog claims that Pfizer is testing a drug to prevent COVID-19 that is essentially the same as ivermectin. The blog suggests, without evidence, that ivermectin has prevented COVID-19 deaths. A headline on Zero Hedge, which weâ€™ve fact-checked before, alluded to ivermectin by stating: ""Pfizer Launches Final Study For COVID Drug That's Suspiciously Similar To 'Horse Paste.â€™"" The post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The postâ€™s reference to ""horse paste"" seems to be a reference to criticism that ivermectin is only for deworming horses. It is used in animals, but it has also been approved for use in humans, just not as a COVID-19 cure. The blog post is based on an article from the Reuters news agency about a Pfizer drug known as PF-07321332. The article said Pfizer has begun a study of the pill in up to 2,660 healthy adults who live in the same household as someone with a confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Pfizer described the drug as a protease inhibitor, which is ""designed to block the activity of the main protease enzyme that the coronavirus needs to replicate."" That would stop symptoms from worsening, a spokesperson said. Zero Hedge seized on the protease inhibitor fact, claiming ""that's exactly what ivermectin"" does. Pfizerâ€™s protease inhibitor is not similar to that of an animal medicine and does not use the same mechanism, a Pfizer spokesperson told us.Â  Benjamin Neuman, chief virologist at Texas A&M University's Global Health Research Complex, said ivermectinâ€™s main job is to block ion channels that parasites use to store up positively and negatively charged atoms. SARS-CoV-2 does not have any ion channels like the ones that ivermectin blocks, so there is not an obvious way for ivermectin to work in COVID-19, he said. Lab studies indicate that ivermectin might inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism is not known and may be more general in nature, said virologist Robert Garry of the Tulane University School of Medicine.Â  In contrast, PF-07321332 is a molecule that sticks to an important part of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, which is very important for virus growth, said Neuman. Blocking the main protease essentially stops all the other virus proteins from working, which is why drugs like PF-07321332 have a lot of potential as antiviral therapies, he said. The Pfizer pill's protease inhibitors are ""highly specific,"" designed to stop replication of the coronavirus, and that makes it quite different from ivermectin, said Garry.Â  ""So no reason to call the Pfizer drug â€˜Pfizermectin,â€™"" Garry said. ""Clever, but no basis in fact."" Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said, ""Itâ€™s unclear what mechanism of action ivermectin has"" when it comes to SARS-Cov2. There is at least one study postulating it blocks the viral protease, he said, but ""none of this is clear and has to be coupled with the fact that there has not been evidence"" that ivermectin is effective in treating COVID-19. ""The Pfizer compound, by contrast, was designed explicitly to target the protease of the virus,"" he said. ""Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that has a distinct mechanism of action against parasites and may happen to have some similarities, by chance, with the Pfizer compound."" As we have reported, some studies have raised the possibility that ivermectin might work in treating COVID-19. But researchers say there is no conclusive evidence that it is an effective COVID-19 treatment. Ivermectin is not approved for COVID-19 prevention or treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has also gone a step further, recommending against its use for COVID-19. Nevertheless, prescriptions for ivermectin have risen 24-fold since before the pandemic. Pfizer is the maker of the only COVID-19 vaccine used in the United States that has been approved by the FDA. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are being given under an emergency use authorization. A blog post claimed: ""Pfizer launches final study for COVID drug that's suspiciously similar to 'horse paste'"" ivermectin. The drug Pfizer is testing to treat COVID-19 is structurally different from ivermectin, which has not been proven to prevent or treat COVID-19.

Comparison of refugee, Social Security payments is outdated and exaggerated
","As refugees from Afghanistan arrive in the U.S. and other countries to start new lives, some social media users have revived an outdated comparison to suggest that the U.S. spends more in benefits for refugees than it does for Social Security recipients. A Sept. 26 Instagram post featured a 2019 tweet from Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of Turning Point USA, who wrote:Â  ""The government pays out $2,125/month in refugee benefits to refugees resettled in the United States. Meanwhile, Social Security recipients who have paid into the system their whole lives receive $1,400/month on average. When will we put Americans first?"" The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This comparison relies on outdated numbers. Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Kirk, told us that Kirk relied on a 2018 PolitiFact article that evaluated similar claims about refugee benefits. But the $2,125 figure did not refer to a monthly payment to assist refugees directly. It referred to a one-time grant to resettlement agencies for each refugee, a portion of which can be used to fund housing and basic necessities during refugeesâ€™ first few months in the U.S. The average Social Security retirement benefit was accurate when the tweet was first posted, but the amount is higher now.Â  Refugee is a legal status for people who come to the United States because they are fleeing wars or persecution in their homeland. In order to stay, refugees must apply for permanent-resident status one year after they arrive. Many donâ€™t speak English and are unfamiliar with U.S. culture and norms when they arrive, so the U.S. offers some temporary assistance to help them adjust.Â  Refugees who are granted resettlement through the State Departmentâ€™s Reception and Placement program are sponsored by a nonprofit resettlement agency and are given essential housing, food and other basic necessities.Â  A one-time payment of $2,275 per refugee is currently provided to the resettlement agencies, the State Department told us.Â  The agency can use $1,225 of the payment for direct assistance on critical needs, such as housing, food, clothing and furnishings during the refugeeâ€™s first 30 to 90 days in the U.S. The rest of the money helps resettlement agencies provide case management services and cultural orientation, and connect eligible refugees with employment services and English language classes. Refugees receive the $1,225 directly only in rare cases in which they have family or friends who can provide housing and other basic needs. This is the total amount available, and it is not a monthly payment, the State Department said. After those first few months, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesâ€™ Office of Refugee Resettlement works with states and other non-governmental organizations to provide other financial aid in the form of Refugee Cash Assistance and Refugee Medical Assistance, as well as other social services.Â  But this is also time-limited: Cash and medical assistance are available for eligible refugees for up to eight months from their arrival date. HHS didnâ€™t tell us how much refugees receive per month under U.S. programs. A department spokesperson told PolitiFact in a previous story that the amount and type of federal aid provided to refugees during their eligibility period can vary greatly. Cash and medical assistance, for example, are handled at the state level, and the cost-sharing amounts differ from state to state. Social Security beneficiaries include both retirees and people living with disabilities. Children can also collect Social Security benefits on a parent's earnings record, according to AARP.Â  Kirkâ€™s tweet used $1,400 to refer to retirement benefits, which is lower than what recipients get now. The average retirement benefit is $1,555 per month, said Darren Lutz, a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration.Â  The average disability benefit in 2021 is $1,280 per month. Some people receive both benefits. The Social Security Administration said benefits will rise 1.3% in 2021 for all beneficiaries, or approximately 70 million Americans. An Instagram post shared a 2019 tweet that claimed the U.S. government pays out ""$2,125/month in refugee benefits to refugees resettled in the United States,"" while Social Security recipients ""who have paid into the system their whole lives receive $1,400/month on average."" These numbers are not accurate. The average Social Security retirement benefit is higher at $1,555 per month. The bigger error is on refugee spending. The State Department issues a one-time $2,275 payment to resettlement agencies for each refugee, of which $1,225 is available for the agencies to use on basic needs for refugees during their first 30 to 90 days in the U.S. Itâ€™s not a monthly payment, as the claim says. Refugees can receive additional assistance from other U.S. programs, but it is temporary.Â  With only a shred of truth, we rate this claim Mostly False.Â ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BDB6C0>],/factchecks/2021/sep/30/instagram-posts/comparison-refugee-social-security-payments-outdat/

No, White House didnâ€™t create fake set just for Joe Bidenâ€™s booster shot
","When President Joe Biden received a coronavirus vaccine booster shot recently, some social media users sought to paint it as a fake event, pointing to the backdrop behind Biden. The posts include photographs of the event showing Biden on a stage, sitting in front of a backdrop of white columns and windows, with reporters and photographers nearby. One Instagram post captioned it this way: ""Fake president, in a fake White House, receiving fake booster.""  Another Facebook post showed a different view of the event with the caption, ""Joe Biden using a fake White House backdrop is so on brand for him."" And another Facebook post alleged, ""They created a fake set for Biden to get his booster shot. The entire Biden presidency is one giant charade.""  The posts were flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Our research uncovered no evidence that the White House intended to mislead anyone by using the windows-and-white-columns background. The backdrop had already been used in one official event five days before Biden received his booster shot. The booster shot was held in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is part of the White House complex but separate from the White House itself. The auditorium is used often for White House media events. Since early this summer, it has hosted Bidenâ€™s remarks on the June jobs report, a bill signing, a meeting on Western wildfires, and Vice President Kamala Harrisâ€™ remarks on broadband. Itâ€™s bigger than the White House press room where the press secretaryâ€™s daily briefings are held, so itâ€™s better suited to some events. Raw footage of the booster shot event uploaded by NBC News shows Biden making remarks on vaccinations at a lectern in the auditorium, then walking across the stage to a chair where he received the vaccination. Behind him was a backdrop featuring white walls and columns, along with ""windows"" seemingly looking out toward the White House itself. After the event, Biden took a few questions.

It was taken by D.C.-based freelance news photographer Brendan Smialowski.Â  Hereâ€™s another view of the auditorium, from a screenshot pulled from the NBC video footage.  The wall-and-column set wasnâ€™t built specifically for the booster shot event. It was a holdover from an event five days earlier, when Biden addressed a virtual summit of world leaders to address the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâ€™s a photograph of Biden at that Aug. 22 summit. President Joe Biden speaks during a virtual COVID-19 summit on Sept. 22, 2021. (AP) Thereâ€™s no indication that anyone in the Biden administration tried to pass this off event as being held inside the White House itself.

Social media posts said the White House ""created a fake set for (President Joe) Biden to get his booster shot."" There was nothing misleading about the event's staging. Biden received his vaccination in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a frequent venue for White House news events and photo ops. Publicly available video footage shows the entire event, including Bidenâ€™s walk from a lectern to the chair set up for his vaccination, and that it was held in the presence of reporters and photographers. In addition, the backdrop wasnâ€™t ""created"" for the booster event at all â€”Â  it had been used five days earlier for a global coronavirus summit.

No evidence infant died due to breast milk from vaccinated mother
","Instagram users shared an alarming headline that said infants died as a result of breastmilk they received from their vaccinated mothers. ""Second breastfeeding baby dies of blood clots and inflamed arteries after motherâ€™s Pfizer shot as per VAERS,"" reads the screenshot shown in a Sept. 22 post.Â  VAERS is short for Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a federal database where anyone can submit a report on a potential vaccine after-effect. The reports are widely accessible but are not verified, leading people who donâ€™t like vaccines to promote unproven connections between vaccines and health events. ""If it kills your baby by being breastfed, what do you think it will do to you in the long run?"" an Instagram user wrote of the COVID-19 vaccine in the caption.Â  The post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Â  There is no evidence that babies are at risk of developing blood clots and other ailments after drinking breastmilk from their vaccinated mothers. But there is evidence that people who receive the vaccine can pass on antibodies against COVID-19 through breastfeeding. The article from the Instagram post was first published on Great Game India, a media site that describes itself as a journal on geopolitics and international relations. Rather than cite VAERS directly, the information in the report comes from the VAERS Wayback Machine on the MedAlerts.org database, which is run by the National Vaccine Information Center.Â  The center is not associated with the U.S. government. Founded as Dissatisfied Parents Together in 1982, it has been criticized for promoting vaccine misinformation. Steven Rubin, the centerâ€™s director of vaccine research analytics, said the VAERS Wayback Machine is based on a collection of U.S. government VAERS releases. Itâ€™s meant to ""track changes that the government might make to VAERS cases, since they never close a case and can make changes at any time,"" Rubin said.Â  We located the same report on the official VAERS system by logging on to the database and entering the reportâ€™s VAERS ID number. The VAERS record doesnâ€™t show personal information for the baby or mother. The report appears to have been filed by the babyâ€™s mother, and it shows that the baby experienced a number of health issues leading to hospitalization. It says that a 6-week-old boy in New Mexico became ""inexplicably ill with a high fever"" after his mother got the Pfizer vaccine on June 4, and was treated with intravenous antibiotics in the hospital for two weeks. The report says that the baby was diagnosed with rhinovirus, a virus that causes the common cold, and was sent home. His mother brought him back a week later and he was diagnosed with an atypical case of Kawasaki disease, which causes fever, skin rashes and inflammation in the arteries of infants and children up to 5 years old. The baby died July 17. Some of the conditions described can be deadly. The baby was diagnosed with atypical Kawasaki disease and lists symptoms that match the description of the disease. The report also states that the baby was born early at 37 weeks due to maternal apendicitis. The author of the report, however, questioned if a spike protein from the Pfizer vaccine ""could have gone through the breast milk and caused an inflammatory response in my child.""Â  Scientists and medical groups say this isnâ€™t possible. Weâ€™ve previously fact-checked unfounded concerns about the impact of spike proteins on fertility and pregnancy.Â  Images of the COVID-19 virus have shown the spike proteins which rest on the outer part of the virus.Â  Â  Â  ""Spike protein"" refers to the crown-like spikes found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. The protein binds cells together to cause an infection. The mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines cause the bodyâ€™s immune system to recognize COVID-19â€™s spike protein and make antibodies against it.Â  Dr. Paul Offit, attending physician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia, said thereâ€™s no chance for a spike protein generated from the vaccine to pass through breast milk and enter a babyâ€™s intestines and blood.Â  ""Even if they entered breast milk, the proteins donâ€™t do well in the face of acids and proteases, which are the kind of enzymes that break down proteins in the mouth and stomach. Otherwise, we would just give all our vaccines by mouth,"" Offit said.Â  Offit also noted that thereâ€™s no evidence that the SARS-CoV2 protein is harmful. PolitiFact cited the CDC in a previous fact-check as saying: â€‹â€‹""Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesnâ€™t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection."" While itâ€™s highly unlikely that the COVID-19 vaccine can negatively impact breastfed babies or their parents, CDC recommendations say ""recent reports show that breastfeeding people who have received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have antibodies in their breastmilk, which could help protect their babies.""Â  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends that breastfeeding parents get any of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S.: Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson and Johnson. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine said in December 2020 that it is unlikely that the mRNA vaccine would enter the bloodstream, reach breast tissue and cause risk to infants. The academy notes, however, that it is possible for antibodies and T-cells stimulated by the vaccine to transfer into milk.Â  The American Academy of Pediatrics published an August 2021 study which found that mothers who are vaccinated against COVID-19 while breastfeeding pass on antibodies to their children. The study stated that all vaccinated study participants had antibodies, and 89% of the antibodies were against SARS-CoV-2. The study found that antibody concentrations were ""more pronounced when lactation periods exceeded 23 months."" An Instagram post claims that a ""second breastfed baby"" died after his mother received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The image in the post is of an article by Great Game India, which cited a case report from an alternative source. The report described several health issues for the baby, including rhinovirus, an atypical case of Kawasaki disease, and a premature birth. The report questioned whether the spike protein created by the vaccine caused problems for the baby, but multiple experts and articles said the proteins are too large to transfer in breast milk.Â  We do not know why the baby died, but there is no evidence that it was a result of breastmilk from his vaccinated mother. We rate this claim False.Â ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097148080>],/factchecks/2021/sep/30/instagram-posts/no-evidence-infant-died-due-breast-milk-vaccinated/
