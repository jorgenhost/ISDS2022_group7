Did Kamala Harris flip-flop on independent probes of police shootings?
","A Republican Super PAC and several news reports said Democratic presidential candidate and California Sen. Kamala Harris shifted her position this week on whether independent prosecutors should probe police shootings. ""Kamala Harris’ latest flip flop is her new-found support for independent investigations of police shootings,"" reads an article posted by the America Rising PAC, which conducts opposition research against Democrats and was founded in 2013. Harris served as California’s attorney general from 2011 through 2016 and before that as San Francisco’s district attorney. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. A number of critics on the left have labeled her a defender of the criminal justice system’s status quo — one that disproportionately punishes the poor and people of color — and not the progressive leader that she claims to be. On the campaign trail, Harris has described the system as ""deeply flawed,"" and in need of reform. To support the flip-flop claim, America Rising cited Harris’ comments in a May 20 interview on MSNBC’s ""The Beat with Ari Melber."" Melber asked Harris: ""What’s the best way to deal with police shootings and alleged police brutality?"" Before she responded, he cited calls by reform advocates to require independent investigations of police shootings and then read a quote from Harris in a December 2014 San Francisco Chronicle article, which said: ""I don’t think it would be good public policy to take the discretion from elected DAs (district attorneys). Where there are abuses, we have designed the system to address them."" Melber continued: ""As you know in the wake of many of these incidents the view is by some that the independent probes are better to not let the DA investigate the cops they work with daily. Have you changed your mind about that or what is the best approach?"" Harris responded: ""I believe the best approach is to have independent investigations."" She added a moment later: ""This is an issue about what we need to do when it comes to these shootings, and I think we are all very clear that there has to be an independent investigation conducted from first moments of the incident so that we can be certain and sure there’s been a thorough investigation that is not informed by bias and so that there will be justice all of the people concerned."" In a news article, Politico reported ""Harris’ remarks on the subject Monday appear to be the first time she’s advocated for a blanket approach to independent probes."" A CNN.com report called it ""a change in her stance on the issue."" Has Harris changed her stance? We’ll use PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter, which rates an official's consistency on an issue. We’re not rating the claim by the Super PAC or news reports, but instead examining whether and how much Harris’ position has changed.  How the Flip-O-Meter works It has three ratings: NO FLIP – No significant change in position. HALF FLIP – A partial change in position. FULL FLOP – A complete change in position. The rating does not make a value judgment about a politician who changes positions on an issue. Some voters appreciate politicians who are flexible and have the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of voters. Still, accusations of shifting positions are common in politics, and we’ve found that an analysis of the shift and the degree of change can be informative. Harris’ past statements Harris’ words in the 2014 Chronicle article show she previously opposed taking away the authority of local district attorneys to probe police shootings. Harris explained in the MSNBC interview that her resistance stemmed from her own fight as San Francisco district attorney to exercise discretion over an investigation, in that case over a probe into the shooting death of a police officer. Comments Harris made in 2016, during her run for U.S. Senate, reinforce the fact that she continued to oppose independent probes. At the time, state lawmakers were debating Assembly Bill 86, which would have required the attorney general’s office to appoint a special prosecutor to examine fatal shootings by the police. In a fact check earlier this year, The New York Times found Harris did not technically take an official position on the bill but ""had repeatedly expressed disagreement with its aims and declined to support the bill."" The Sacramento Bee in May 2016 reported that, ""In an interview, Harris said she didn’t support the measure, Assembly Bill 86, because it would have taken discretion from district attorneys. Unless they have been shown to abuse their powers, she thinks they should retain them. Harris disputed that her relationship with law enforcement had bearing."" The article added: ""Here’s the bottom line: I am trying to change the system from the inside,"" she said. ""They (activists) are trying to change the system from the outside. And together, change will occur."" Police in Sacramento in March 2019 block protesters following a demonstration over the decision not to charge the officers who shot Stephon Clark. Andrew Nixon / Capital Public Radio Response from Harris campaign A Harris campaign spokeswoman declined to talk about how much the senator’s stance has shifted. But she clarified that Harris now believes independent probes into police shootings should replace those by local district attorneys, and not just take place in addition to them. She pointed to two more news articles that describe then-Attorney General Harris’ efforts to pay for independent probes. A September 2016 Chronicle article describes her request to state leaders for ""the necessary resources to create new teams within the attorney general’s office to conduct criminal investigations of officer-involved shootings."" That budget request was denied. The spokeswoman also cited a Washington Post fact check from this year. It outlines comments from state Asm. Kevin McCarty, the author of AB 86. While Harris did not officially endorse the bill, McCarty told the Post that she expressed support for it a year later by making the state budget requests. ""She did come around, and I was very pleased,"" McCarty told the Post. ""I think she had to walk a fine line being the state’s top cop and the practical purposes of such a position, and the fact that she had experience coming up as a DA."" In 2018, after the fatal Sacramento police shooting of Stephon Clark made national headlines, Harris also stopped short of calling for an independent probe. She spoke at a Sacramento town hall shortly after the shooting about the need for implicit bias training for police, but did not ask for the probe to be taken away from local prosecutors. Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris said this week police shootings should undergo independent investigations rather than having local district attorneys handle them. News reports and a Republican Super PAC called this an about-face.   A review of her public statements shows Harris opposed taking investigative authority away from local prosecutors in 2014. Two years later, she declined to endorse a bill to require her attorney general’s office to appoint a special prosecutor to examine fatal shootings by the police. She also did not call for this change after a high-profile fatal police shooting in Sacramento in 2018. Her campaign pointed to Harris’ behind-the-scenes efforts, as attorney general, to request funds for independent prosecutors. But she did not publicly change her stance until her comments this week on MSNBC. We rate Harris’ new position a Full Flop. FULL FLOP – A complete change in position.

Fact-checking Donald Trump's claim that drug prices are going down
","President Donald Trump repeated a misleading claim about the cost of prescription drugs under his watch. ""Drug prices are coming down, first time in 51 years because of my administration, but we can get them down way lower working with the Democrats,"" Trump said in a May 22 address in the Rose Garden. Trump called a news conference to push back against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s comments accusing Trump of a cover-up related to congressional probes of his administration. We fact-checked a similar statement in April by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, rating it Mostly False. Nothing has changed our conclusion since then. After Trump’s Rose Garden speech, we sent the White House press office emails asking if they had any evidence beyond what we reported in our earlier fact-check; we did not get a response. In April, the White House directed us to a 2018 report published by its Council of Economic Advisers pointing to efforts by the Trump administration to bring down prescription costs. Also, the White House sent us data suggesting the consumer price index for prescription drugs declined in January 2019 compared with January 2018.  The White House sent data stating the cost in January was 11 percent below where trends said it should have been. However, the most recent data from the federal government shows a slight uptick: prescription drug prices increased by 0.3% in April 2019 compared to April 2018. It is possible to define time periods in such a way to make the statement — or something close to it — accurate with respect to the prescription drug CPI, said Matthew Fiedler, a health economist at the Brookings Institution. But the CPI is a highly imperfect measure for tracking prescription drug price trends, because it measures list prices rather than net prices. ""For most purposes, net prices are the most economically relevant quantity,"" he said. ""And it’s unclear how much credit the administration really deserves for these trends."" The CPI data doesn’t account for whether manufacturers lowering their list prices have also changed the size of the rebates they provide. Also, this data also doesn’t cover all prescriptions — it only covers drugs sold through retail, or about three-fourths of all prescriptions, and excludes many high-priced specialty meds sold only via mail order. The administration’s proposal to have Medicare pay for physician-administered drugs based on average prices internationally could substantially reduce prices for these drugs, if implemented, Fiedler said. However, when — and even whether — it will ultimately be implemented remains an open question. It’s also worth noting that both the Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary have concluded that one of the administration’s other marquee proposals — a requirement that plans pass rebates through to patients in Medicare Part D — would actually increase drug prices on net, Fiedler said. This proposal looks like it’s on track for implementation in 2020 or 2021. Other measures of drug costs do not support what Trump said. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows total spending on prescription drug prices has climbed during the past several years. (Kaiser Health News, a PolitiFact partner, is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) In 2018, total spending continued to grow, just at a slower pace. That’s a positive trend, experts noted, but it isn’t the same thing as spending going down. Benedic Ippolito, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact that it is a bit challenging to conclusively connect the Trump administration’s actions to substantial reductions in drug prices -- at least not yet, as many of their more consequential proposed reforms have not been implemented. Some manufacturers are reporting that their average net prices have declined in recent years. For example, Janssen, the pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, reported net prices dropped 6.8% in 2018. However, many drug prices have climbed. This year, the list price of more than 3,000 drugs went up, while the price of only 117 went down, according to data compiled by Rx Savings Solutions. Last year, an analysis by the Associated Press revealed that, from January to July, 4,412 branded drug prices went up, while 46 were cut. In April, a White House spokesman pointed to their efforts to bring more generic drugs to market. But experts said it takes time for these products to reach the marketplace, create competition and demonstrate a measurable impact on prices. In May, Trump urged his Department of Health and Human Services to help Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on his priority to adopt a Canadian drug importation program with the goal of bringing down prices for consumers. No HHS secretary has ever issued such an approval. It's also unclear whether such an importation program would bring down prices, since drug manufacturers could cut down on what they sell to Canadian entities supplying drugs to American wholesalers. Trump said, ""Drug prices are coming down, first time in 51 years because of my administration."" There is data that could conceivably support the argument that the list prices for some prescription drugs dipped in 2018. But that data doesn’t include many high-priced specialty drugs that drive costs up or the fact that some individual drug prices have increased. Nationally, spending on drugs has continued to climb, even if that growth has slowed. There is also no evidence to support the argument that Trump himself is responsible for changes in drug pricing. This claim has an element of truth, but it ignores key facts and context that would give a very different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Claims that Democrats didn’t attend a hearing about the border are wrong
","Did Democrats ditch a hearing with border officials? So claims a May 12 Facebook post featuring a still from Fox News. The image shows a hearing room with red circles drawn around empty seats behind the dais. The Fox News alert at the bottom of the still says: ""Border officials testify on Capitol Hill,"" and the words ""Capitol Hill Tuesday"" appears in the upper left corner. ""This is why I vote Republican,"" text above the image says. ""I am across the board Republican. Not one Democrat showed up to listen to border officials about the dangerous situation at our border.

Here’s what we know. On Tuesday, April 9, the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs had a hearing under the title: ""Unprecedented migration at the U.S. southern border: Perspectives from the frontline."" The hearing lasted 2 hours and 35 minutes, according to a C-SPAN video, and featured several witnesses, including Rodolfo Karisch, a chief patrol agent with U.S. Border Patrol, and Greg Cherundolo, chief of operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration. After Cherundolo finished his introductory comments, about 40 minutes into the hearing, committee chairman Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said: ""Thank you Mr. Cherundolo. Again, I really appreciate the attendance by members so I’ll defer my questioning to the end. We do have a vote we’re going to have to deal with at 11-o'clock, my intention will be to keep the hearing going."" Then he turned the floor over to Sen. Gary Peters, the committee’s ranking Democratic member from Michigan. Including the chairman and ranking minority member, there are eight Republicans and six Democrats on the committee. Transcripts of the hearing show that three other Republican senators spoke — James Lankford of Oklahoma, Mitt Romney of Utah, and Rob Portman of Ohio — and five other Democratic senators spoke — Kamala Harris of California, Tom Carper of Delaware, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. On April 10, Griff Jenkins, a Fox News correspondent, tweeted what looks like the picture that appeared on Fox News and was used in the Facebook post. ""As @CBP and @CBPRGV officials make closing statements before the the (sic) Senate Homeland Security Cmte, not a single senator stayed to listen save the Chairman @SenRonJohnson #border #emptychairs,"" he said. Closing comments from Cherundolo, Karisch and three other witnesses began at the 2 hour and 30 minute mark — five minutes before the meeting was adjourned. Video from C-SPAN does show that over the course of the hearing, the number of senators seated to listen to the hearing dwindled and, by the time of these closing comments, Johnson was the only seated senator visible within camera view. But the Facebook post claims that no Democrats showed up to listen to border officials, which just isn’t true. We rate this Facebook post False. Correction: This story was updated to reflect that Sen. Gary Peters is from Michigan.

No, Pennsylvania special election winner was not in 50-50 race

Allegations of racism against Trump didn't start when he challenged the Democrats
","President Donald Trump’s political allegiance has swayed between parties, and a recent Facebook post suggests that Democrats have only accused him of racism since he left their camp. ""Donald Trump has been in public eye for over 30 years,"" the May 16 post says, ""and he was never once accused of being racist by anyone until he decided to run against the Democrats."" This post, which features photos of Trump with black figures such as civil rights activist Al Sharpton and The Apprentice winner Randal Pinkett, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the truth is that Trump has battled charges of racism almost as long as he has been in the public eye — and long before he stepped into politics. A January 2018 opinion article in the New York Times calls Trump a racist. ""He talks about and treats people differently based on their race,"" the story says. ""He has done so for years, and he is still doing so."" The piece compiles quotes from Trump from before he ran for president as a Republican in the 2016 election and cites incidents such as when, in the 1970s, Trump’s real estate company ""tried to avoid renting apartments to African-Americans."" A February Vox article similarly documents what it calls the president’s ""long history of racism"" from the 1970s to date. The story references the first time Trump appeared in the New York Times — Oct. 16, 1973 — when the paper ran a front-page story about a lawsuit against the then-27-year-old and his father. ""Major landlord accused of antiblack bias in city,"" the headline said. The story begins: ""The Department of Justice, charging discrimination against blacks in apartment rentals, brought suit in Federal Court in Brooklyn yesterday against the Trump Management Corporation, a major owners and manager of real estate here. The corporation, which owns and rents more than 14,000 apartments in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 in its operation of 39 buildings."" The DOJ claimed ""Trump Management had refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‘because of race and color,’"" the Times reported. ""It also charged that the company had required different rental terms and conditions because of race and that it had misrepresented to blacks that apartments were not available."" Trump, who was the company’s president, called the charges ""absolutely ridiculous"" and said ""we have never discriminated and never would."" Trump Management then sued the U.S. government and under a June 1975 agreement the company was required to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies every week for two years. Trump Management said the agreement was not an admission of guilt. Nearly two decades later, in 1989, Trump ran an advertisement in New York City papers calling for the death penalty for the black suspects in the so-called ""Central Park jogger"" case, in which five juveniles were accused of raping and beating a young white woman. (The boys were found guilty but their convictions were overturned after another man admitted to the crime in 2002.) Two black ministers called Trump’s ad a ""thinly veiled racist polemic"" and questioned why he was concerned about the jogger but seemingly unconcerned about a black man who had been chased to his death by white teenagers in Howard Beach, Newsday reported. In 1992, the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino lost its appeal of a $200,000 discrimination penalty ""imposed because managers catered to the presumed prejudices of a high roller by removing a black dealer from his table,"" UPI then reported. Recent news stories have also documented allegations of racism about incidents that happened before Trump ran for president. In 2015, for example, the New Yorker reported on Kip Brown, who used to work at Atlantic City casinos including Trump’s Castle. ""When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,"" the magazine quotes Brown as saying. ""It was the eighties, I was a teen-ager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back."" Searching for ""Donald Trump"" and the word ""racist"" in the Nexis news database, we found hundreds of results, including this headline from a May 2011 Hollywood Reporter story: ""Donald Trump denies he’s racist because one ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ winner is black."" In 2012, after a SignOn.org campaign asking Macy’s to sever ties with Trump over his skepticism of Barack Obama’s birthplace, the singer Cher called him a ""racist cretin"" in a tweet. Our ruling A viral image suggests that Donald Trump was only ever accused of racism after he decided to run for public office against Democrats. The record is clear, however, that Trump has deflected allegations that he is a racist since the 1970s and many times since.

Gillibrand points to early support for Medicare for all
","In a Democratic field that gets more crowded by the day, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is pointing to her record as proof that she has supported policies that are appealing to primary voters. ""I actually in 2005 ran on Medicare for all, the liberal issue of making sure people can buy into health care that they can afford,"" Gillibrand told a crowd gathered in a New Hampshire coffee shop. We decided to check this claim, which references Gillibrand’s first run for Congress in 2006. She defeated Republican Rep. John Sweeney in New York’s 20th Congressional District, which had a substantial enrollment advantage for Republicans.   We used the Internet Archive Wayback Machine to access her 2006 campaign website, which contained her policy positions. Her ""health care solutions plan"" calls for a ""focus on preventative care -- rather than the emergency room -- as the primary health care option by offering individuals, family or business the option to buy into Medicare at a rate they can afford."" On YouTube, we found a speech from an October 2006 campaign rally, during which Gillibrand spoke about health care. She started by criticizing insurance companies’ big advertising budgets and high chief executive pay.   ""What needs to happen is there needs to be more competition in the system,"" Gillibrand said. ""And what I would like to see is a low-cost alternative. I’d like to see Medicare be available to anyone who wants to buy into that system.""  Gillibrand’s campaign spokeswoman, Meredith Kelly, sent us a list of sources supporting Gillibrand’s claim that she supported a public option when she ran for Congress in 2006. One was a portion of a news article published on Nov. 3, 2006, in the Times-Union of Albany, which reported that ""Gillibrand favors allowing Americans to buy into the Medicare system; Sweeney denounced her proposal as a move toward universal health care."" We also reached out to the University at Albany, where health economist Diane Dewar said she recalled Gillibrand’s early support for Medicare for all. ""She is obviously is very supportive of the public option,"" Dewar said. Medicare for all can mean different things.  Sen. Bernie Sanders would implement a single-payer system over four years, PolitiFact reported in April. Gillibrand, who supports that plan, said that she wrote the section of the bill that allows the public to buy into Medicare during the four-year transition. Premiums would depend on how much each person earns but would be capped at 2 to 5 percent of income. ""What I like about where the Democrats are today is, we have four or five versions of `Medicare-for-all',"" Gillibrand told the Associated Press in February. ""I think we all want to get to single payer. And I think the best way to do it is what I wrote in Sen. Sanders' bill."" Sanders’ proposal would be more generous than the current Medicare program, PolitiFact reported. Gillibrand said that when she was running in 2005, she supported Medicare for all. Her campaign began in 2005, and in 2006 she talked about a Medicare for all plan that would offer a public option. Though different versions of Medicare for all have existed over time, Gillibrand was clear about what her version meant when she ran in 2006.

Will Wisconsin taxpayers get 'tremendous' payback for money spent on new Fiserv Forum?
","Excitement at the new Fiserv Forum is palpable as the Milwaukee Bucks face the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference Finals, the team’s deepest playoff run in 18 years. While the arena is rockin’ and rollicking now, not everyone was on board when building a new downtown arena was proposed as a way to keep the Bucks in town. Replacing the circa 1988 Bradley Center, which is currently being demolished, took on a new urgency in April 2014 when former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, who had owned the team since 1985, announced he was selling the Bucks to billionaire investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. The financing package for the $500 million facility, which eventually cost $524 million, was the subject of considerable debate in Madison in 2015. It finally won approval with half the original cost estimate, or $250 million, coming through state and local sources. Of that, $80 million came from the state. Scott Neitzel, a top Department of Administration official under Republican Gov. Scott Walker, argued that the ""payback for state taxpayers is tremendous."" ""For that $80 million, the state -- just in income tax revenue from events that go on here, just from the basketball events actually -- is estimated to be probably over $600 million over the life of the lease,"" Neitzel said during a May 12, 2019, interview on WISN’s UpFront.   Is Neitzel, who signed the Wisconsin Center District-Bucks 30-year lease deal, right? Let’s take a look. The evidence Neitzel once led the Wisconsin Center District board, the public agency that owns the facility, which has been in the news as the site of the Democratic National Convention in 2020. When asked for backup, Neitzel pointed to two documents. One document refers to ""an estimated $634M in NBA-related state income tax revenues over next 30 years"" and the other to ""$634,000,000 over 30 years in estimated state income tax revenues associated with NBA team (State Department of Revenue Estimate)."" The origin of the documents was unclear, as they were not attributed to any particular entity. ""I believe they were issued by the WI Center District and/the WI Department of Administration at the time,"" Neitzel explained in an email. ""The actual income tax numbers were generated by the WI Department of Revenue.""   The cost to state taxpayers PolitiFact Wisconsin turned to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, considered the gold standard on state fiscal matters. The bureau noted the Bucks arena legislation created two appropriations related to the construction of the arena. ""One appropriates $4 million general purpose revenue (GPR) from the state to the Wisconsin Center District to fund the principal interest costs on a portion of the Center's bonds issued to finance the construction of the arena. This appropriation will sunset after 20 years. (Hence $4 million times 20 years would equal $80 million)."" ""The second appropriates $4 million general purpose revenue annually each year for 20 years to the Wisconsin Center District. However, it is effectively offset by a corresponding $4 million annual GPR reduction to Milwaukee County's county and municipal aid payment over the same 20 years. Hence, these two actions together have the effect of having no fiscal impact to the state."" So, in a nutshell, the state pays out $160 million, but gets $80 million back in the form of Milwaukee County's shared revenue reduction, so the result is a net $80 million cost to the state. According to the fiscal bureau, the state is scheduled to pay $4 million a year for 20 years and then the appropriation goes away.   In other words, unless the Legislature sets the appropriation at a higher level or deletes the sunset of the appropriation -- $80 million is all the Wisconsin Center District gets from state taxpayers. Tax revenue estimate What about the tax revenue side? Let’s start with this: Those who work in the state -- in this case, NBA players and coaches -- owe Wisconsin income tax on the money earned here. That’s what Neitzel is referring to by the income tax that will be generated. The state Department of Revenue has estimated that over the life of the 30-year lease (2016 to 2046), the state would collect a total of $514.9 million in additional incremental revenue. That’s based on its projections that NBA salaries will increase dramatically over that time. In 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin reported that the state would collect $6.5 million in income taxes from NBA players for 2014. That gives us a rough baseline. The increased revenue projections range from $0.9 million in 2016-’17 to $39.1 million in 2046-’47. Let’s pause here to say, well, that is a lot of money. By this projection, NBA salaries -- and the income taxes they generate -- would be nearly five times higher by the last year than the $6.5 million starting point. Even then, that increased revenue only tallies $514.9 million. How does the department get to $600 million? That comes from adding in the baseline $6.5 million for each year. Afterall, if the Bucks had left town, the state would have lost that money entirely. A fiscal bureau document shows a total of $717.16 million in NBA-related income tax revenue from 2016 to 2046. So, that’s even more than Neitzel claimed as the estimate. A key here, of course, is that these 30-year state income tax revenue projections are exactly that -- projections -- or estimates. That said, Neitzel framed his statement as an estimate, and relied on official numbers from established state agencies in doing so. Stadium financing experts weigh in Rick Eckstein, a Villanova University professor and co-author of ""Public Dollars, Private Stadiums: The Battle over Building Sports Stadiums,"" called the revenue estimates ""fantasy figures."" ""My two decades of research and writing on this topic has led me to take these kinds of assertions with several pounds of salt,"" Eckstein said in an email. ""They are fantasy figures, often based on ‘advocacy studies’ masquerading as objective analysis that have been commissioned by the team or its benefactors. Remember, too, that any income allegedly generated by the arena IS NOT INDEPENDENT of any current revenues. It's a question of gross increases (if any) versus net increases."" Eckstein also said revenues from taxing player salaries is only the latest in a long line of promised revenue windfalls from stadium proponents. ""First, they promised sales tax increases from all the extra spending that would take place in or near the stadiums. Then, it was hotel tax revenues that would soar from all the people coming to games and needing a place to stay. That was followed by supposed property tax increases, after the stadium increased local land values. Now it's the income taxes from player salaries."" Robert Baade, a Lake Forest College professor of economics and one of the first economists to study the effects of publicly financed stadiums on cities, called the estimates ""hyperbole."" ""Moving the Bucks from the Bradley Center to Fiserv is a couple hundred feet,"" Baade said in a phone call. ""It’s not going to induce significant economic impact.""   The Neitzel claim, though, was about a specific thing -- income tax revenue to the state. Baade had a caution there as well, noting more things are at play. ""Players appropriate most of the revenue that results from local fan spending,"" he said. ""This results in a significant outflow of city income that results from spending related to sports relative to that which would occur if entertainment was on locally owned and operated entertainment activities. Players do repatriate their earnings to their primary residences."" Our ruling Neitzel said the  state contributed $80 million for the new Bucks arena, but new income tax revenue from basketball events alone ""is estimated to be probably over $600 million over the life of the lease."" Stadium financing experts called the projections ""fantasy figures"" and ""hyperbole"" and noted such projections rarely have come true on past projects. That said, the estimates were created by state agencies. And Neitzel couched his claim as a projected figure. We rate his claim Mostly True.

Donald Trump wrong that Joe Biden abandoned Scranton
","At a rally in Montoursville, Pa., President Donald Trump took issue with the Pennsylvania cred of former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his possible 2020 Democratic challengers. At the May 20 rally, Trump criticized Biden for abandoning his birthplace, Scranton, located 80 miles east of Montoursville. Here’s what Trump said: ""And don't forget Biden deserted you. He's not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state. Remember that, please. I meant to say that. This guy talks about oh, I know Scranton. ... Well, I know the places better. He left you for another state and he didn't take care of you because he didn't take care of your jobs."" Does Trump have a point about Biden ditching Pennsylvania? The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but most observers we checked with rejected Trump’s portrayal — starting with the fact that Biden was in elementary school when his family moved to Delaware, the state he would later represent in the Senate. Biden spent his early youth in Scranton, an aging industrial city in northeastern Pennsylvania, living there for a decade and attending Catholic school. In a 2016 interview with the genealogical website Ancestry.com, Biden said: ""My roots run deep in Lackawanna County and in Scranton. It’s where my great-great-grandfather Patrick Blewitt ultimately settled from County Mayo in 1851. On the other side of the family, my great-great-grandfather Owen Finnegan immigrated to Seneca County, New York, from Ireland’s County Louth in 1849. But his son, my great-grandfather James, ultimately moved to settle in Scranton. ""Scranton is where my grandfather Ambrose Finnegan met and in 1909 married my grandmother Geraldine Blewitt. It’s where my mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, was born, and where she met and in 1941 married my father, Joseph Biden, Sr. ""I lived in Scranton until I was in the fourth grade, but for the next 10-12 years, I spent most of my summers and holidays with the Finnegan family back in Scranton. And I keep in contact to this day with friends I made in Scranton, as well as family members still living there. ... ""So I’m a proud Delawarean — and it was my great honor to spend the better part of my adult life representing that state — but I am a son of Scranton."" In 1953, his family left Scranton. His namesake father had been commuting to Wilmington, Del., for a job cleaning boilers and decided to move the family closer to his job. The future vice president, 10 at the time, would have had little say in the matter. Despite building his political career in Delaware, Biden has often touted his blue-collar roots in Scranton. In fact, Biden has talked about it so much that that Saturday Night Live satirized the habit in both 2008 and 2012, when he was a vice presidential candidate. More than most politicians, observers say, Biden has managed to pull off the straddle of officially representing one state but unofficially representing another. He was often referred to as Pennsylvania’s ""third senator."" Biden ""visited the state frequently during his 36 years in the Senate,"" said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. ""The custom of referring to him as Pennsylvania’s third senator came from the late Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, with whom he had a great relationship."" From his perch in the Senate, Biden regularly championed legislation of importance to Pennsylvania, said Thomas J. Baldino, a political scientist at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Particularly important were bills that brought work to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, until it closed, and the Boeing Vertol plant in Delaware County, Pa. ""Both employed people who lived in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. He also supported dredging the Delaware River to benefit the ports of Wilmington, Philadelphia, and Camden. I could go on and on,"" Baldino said. Such work gained him media attention in Pennsylvania. ""Delaware has no commercial TV, so Biden was covered by the Philadelphia media market, which gave him considerable exposure in the city and its suburbs,"" Madonna said. Scranton residents appreciated Biden throughout his career, said Jean W. Harris, a University of Scranton political scientist. She says Trump ""overreached"" in suggesting he knew Scrantonites better than Biden does. ""Scrantonians see Biden as one of their own,"" Harris said. ""Biden is certainly viewed as a hard working, blue-collar aligned, Pennsylvanian by those here in northeastern Pennsylvania. Even younger people here, such as my undergraduate students from the area, feel an affinity for Biden."" And Delaware residents don’t hold Biden’s Pennsylvania ties against him, said Allan Loudell, a longtime radio host on WDEL in Wilmington. ""I have never, ever have heard a complaint from a Delawarean — never even from a conservative on a telephone talk-show — about Biden being Pennsylvania's ‘third senator,’ "" Loudell said. The most critical response we heard was from Vince Galko, a Republican consultant with deep ties in northeastern Pennsylvania. Galko said that, whatever Biden’s personal outreach to Scranton, the region’s demographics have driven it away from his Democratic Party, which is too socially liberal for many residents. In Lackawanna County, the Obama-Biden ticket in 2012 won by a 27-point margin, but in 2016, Trump fell just 3 percentage points short of winning the county. ""There was a reason why in 2016 voters put up Trump signs in neighborhoods of Scranton — places where Republican signs had never been before — and for the most part those signs haven’t come down,"" Galko said. Trump said that Biden ""deserted you. … I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state."" Biden was only 10 when his family moved from Scranton to Delaware, but he maintained ties, to various degrees, for the rest of his youth and adulthood. Moreover, in the Senate he was sometimes called ""Pennsylvania’s third senator"" due to his close attention to legislation affecting neighboring Pennsylvania. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/may/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-joe-biden-abandoned-scranton/

Trump says NY didn't fight SALT cap
","President Donald Trump called out New York on Twitter, asserting the state did not fight a provision in the 2017 tax law backed by Republicans. The provision, a $10,000 limit on deductions of state and local taxes, has a negative impact for some filers largely in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. His tweet followed the news that New York Attorney General Letitia James would investigate the National Rifle Association and its tax-exempt status.   ""...People are fleeing New York State because of high taxes and yes, even oppression of sorts,"" Trump wrote. ""They didn’t even put up a fight against SALT - could have won. So much litigation. The NRA should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with (unfair) State!"" Trump’s claim that New York didn’t fight the provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that caps the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000 was immediately challenged. Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democrat who represents Rockland County and part of Westchester County, tweeted: ""Is he living under a rock?! We fought tooth and nail against the Republican elimination of the SALT deduction. If he’s OK with bringing it back, he should join me in convincing members of his own party to reverse their decision to hurt working families."" During a news conference on the day Trump tweeted, Gov. Andrew Cuomo questioned why Trump supported the policy if he knew it was bad for New York. ""What he said about SALT is unbelievable,"" Cuomo said. ""I’ve been saying for months it was an assault on New York, pardon the pun,"" Cuomo said. ""And now the President is running from his own policy. ... Why did you start it? It was your policy. It is your budget. You took credit for it."" We asked Trump’s press office about how he formed his view of New York’s response to the cap but did not receive a response. Cuomo’s response to the cap goes back to 2017, when it was proposed. Shortly before it became law, he called the SALT cap provision an ""economic dagger directed at this state"" and ""a gross injustice."" In 2018 he launched a campaign against the provision using legal and legislative tools. Cuomo even met with Trump at the White House in February to discuss changes to the cap after Trump indicated he would be open to them. Cuomo has continued to publicly criticize the cap, and following his meeting with Trump, he announced he had enlisted other governors in the effort. ""As governor of the state of New York today, my top priority is repealing SALT. Period,"" Cuomo told reporters in March. Advocacy came from New Yorkers in Congress, too. In October 2017, when discussion of the Republican tax changes was in the early stages, Sen. Charles Schumer called on New York’s House delegation to oppose any proposed repeal of the state and local tax deduction.  While negotiations were ongoing, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, in a news conference with Schumer, spoke of how people were upset with proposed changes to state and local tax deductions, that it ""rubs salt in the wounds of the taxpayers."" Schumer's spokesperson, Dan Yoken, also provided a lengthy history of Schumer's public advocacy on the issue, including at least 22 instances in which the senator spoke publicly about preserving the SALT deduction.  In October 2017, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox Business: ""Senator Schumer has been complaining about this [SALT Deduction] since the beginning of the year."" Democrats did not vote in favor of the law, and some Republicans in New York’s House delegation voted against it too, including Reps. Peter King and Lee Zeldin of Long Island, Dan Donovan of Staten Island, John Faso of the Albany and Catskills areas, and Elise Stefanik, who represents the Adirondack and North Country regions. With one exception, House Republicans who voted against the tax reform law were from New York, New Jersey, and California.    New York Republicans voting in favor of it were Reps. Chris Collins, Tom Reed, Claudia Tenney and John Katko. Some of the New York and New Jersey Republicans who favored the law told the New York Times that they blamed state government, not the tax bill, for the problems the SALT cap would create.   The Trump administration also blocked states’ efforts to work around the cap, once the law was enacted, something Lowey fought in a letter to the IRS commissioner.   Lowey and King have bipartisan legislation to restore the SALT deduction, introduced in January 2018 and in January 2019.  Trump said that people in New York didn’t fight a cap on the deduction of state and local taxes, which was included in the 2017 tax reform law. New York elected officials have been speaking out against it since the time it was proposed, in the news media, in meetings with Trump, and in Congress. While the majority of New York’s representatives in Congress voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, four Republican New York House members voted for it. The Democrats who were vocal in speaking against the SALT cap were in the minority party and had little influence in the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, all controlled by Republicans. If anyone didn’t ""put up a fight"" in New York, it could have been the Republicans who could have used their influence as members of the majority party to push to eliminate the cap, but voted in favor of the tax legislation.

No, NASA did not spend over $165 million on a space pen while Russians used pencils
","A long-running online myth mocks how much time and money NASA and Congress allegedly spent to develop a space pen that can write in zero gravity and extreme temperatures because the Russians simply ""used a pencil."" The post reads, ""(When) NASA started sending astronauts into space they quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat this problem Congress approved a program and NASA scientists spent a decade and over $165 million developing a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, on almost any surface and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 Celsius. The Russians used a pencil...Your taxes are due again in April."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the claim makes for a good story, it has been debunked several times over. According to NASA, both U.S. astronauts and Soviet Union cosmonauts used pencils on their first space missions. In fact, NASA ordered 34 mechanical pencils from Houston’s Tycam Engineering Manufacturing, Inc., for Project Gemini, the agency’s second human spaceflight program, which flew in 1965 and 1966. The total cost, however, came to $4,382.50 — or $128.89 a pencil. Public outcry followed, and NASA began searching for a cheaper option for future flights. (NASA also became especially cautious about allowing onboard flammable objects such as pencils after a fire broke out in 1967 on the Apollo 1 test mission, killing three astronauts.) It was around the same time that Paul C. Fisher and his company, the Fisher Pen Co., designed a ballpoint pen that would operate better in space. The company reportedly invested about $1 million in the effort. But none of those funds came from NASA or Congress, according to multiple sources, including NASA and a spokesperson for Fisher’s company, now called Fisher Space Pen. In 1965, Fisher patented the Space Pen, which used a pressurized ink cartridge and could write upside down, underwater, in other liquids and in extreme temperatures ranging from minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of the earlier controversy, though, NASA reports in its own account that it was ""hesitant in its approach."" After a series of tests, NASA managers agreed to equip astronauts with Fisher’s anti-gravity ballpoint pen and, in 1967, the space agency purchased approximately 400 pens at $6 per unit. In 1969, the Soviet Union also purchased 100 of Fisher’s pens, and 1,000 ink cartridges, for use in its Soyuz space flights. According to Scientific American, eventually NASA and the Soviet space agency both bought the pens at $2.39 per pen, receiving the same discount for buying  in bulk. In the 50 years since, both American astronauts and Soviet/Russian cosmonauts have continued to use Fisher’s pens. An old myth that NASA and Congress spent over ""$165 million"" to develop the space pen while the Russians simply used pencils has recently resurfaced on the internet. Initially, both space programs used pencils. Both eventually started to use Fisher’s Space Pen, which was developed and funded with private money, not government money.   We rate this story False.",/factchecks/2019/may/21/facebook-posts/no-nasa-did-not-spend-over-165-million-space-pen-w/

Fact-checking Steve Bullock on decline of the American Dream
","Montana Gov. Steve Bullock -- a late entry into the Democratic race for the 2020 presidential nomination -- decried the withering of the American dream in a recent interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. ""You look at today, only half the 30-year-olds are doing better than their parents were at age 30. When I was being raised, it was 90%,"" Bullock said in the May 19 interview. Is that correct? Basically, yes. The talking point is supported by a study on income published in 2016 and co-authored by six economists affiliated with the University of California-Berkeley, Harvard University, and Stanford University. The paper calculated the fraction of children born between 1940 and 1984 who were earning more than their parents. The authors said their assessment was more complete than previous research because they were working with more detailed data that linked parents to their children. Overall, the study found that upward mobility began at 90% for children born in 1940 but fell to about 50% for children born in the 1980s. Here’s a chart produced by the Brookings Institution showing the relevant data from the study:  At first glance, we thought Bullock had miscalculated. Bullock was born on April 11, 1966, so the period when he was ""being raised"" would have been roughly between 1966 and 1980. During that period, according to the graph, the percentages out-earning their parents ranged between 57% and 61% -- not 90%, as Bullock had said. But when we checked in with a co-author, Maximilian Hell of Stanford, he said that Bullock was actually on target. The data in the paper, he said, referred to the point at which the children were 30 years old. This means that the 30-year-olds when Bullock was four years old in 1970 were themselves born in 1940, and 90% of that birth group out-earned their parents. That did change a bit over time. By the time Bullock was 14, the 30-year olds were born in 1950, and by then, the percentage had fallen to 79%. By the time Bullock was 18, the percentage had fallen to 68%. In other words, Bullock would have been right about the people who were 30 when he was born, but the 90% figure he offered would be too high to apply to those who were 30 year olds when he was a teenager (though even that percentage is still significantly higher than today’s 50%). We’ll note that, according to the authors, improving today’s 50% figure would require more than just accelerated economic growth -- it would also require a lessening of income inequality. Bullock said, ""You look at today, only half the 30-year-olds are doing better than their parents were at age 30. When I was being raised, it was 90%."" The people who were 30 when Bullock was age 4 did indeed have a 90% likelihood of out-earning their parents. However, that number dropped by the time he was 18 to 68%. Still, even that smaller percentage was higher than today’s 50% figure. In other words, economic mobility has decreased significantly since Bullock, 53, was a boy.

"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Chris  Coons']","
Did the Affordable Care Act create preexisting condition protections for people in employer plans?
","During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) answered questions from ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski about the latest lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. ""The most important part of Obamacare, as you know, Mika, is the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer,"" he said. Because, as almost everyone agrees, health care is complicated, we decided to take a closer look at Coons’ statement, especially because much has been written and said — and put in campaign ads — about how many Americans have preexisting health conditions and how they gained insurance protections under the ACA. We will not attempt to judge Sen. Coons’ assertion that the ACA’s protection for people with preexisting conditions is ""the most important part"" of the law, although it is often mentioned along with the expansion of Medicaid to millions more Americans with low incomes. We started out by contacting Coons’ office to get the background information on his assertion, but didn’t hear back. So, we moved on to examining the statutes and talking to various experts. First came HIPAA What we found out is what few people realize: Protections for preexisting conditions for most people with job-based insurance predated the ACA by more than a decade. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, is best known for its provisions regarding medical privacy and patient access to their medical records. But the principal purpose of the law was to put an end to what was known as ""job lock."" That happened when people with preexisting health conditions were afraid to leave one job with insurance for another job with insurance because the new insurance would not cover their condition, or would impose long waiting periods. ""HIPAA was a big advancement at the time in terms of protecting people with preexisting conditions who had employer coverage,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor who studies health insurance at Georgetown University. Specifically, HIPAA required that as long as someone had been continuously covered by health insurance for at least 12 months, without a break longer than 63 days, new insurance at a new job could not impose waiting periods for a worker or family member. HIPAA also required insurers who sold policies in the small-group market to sell to all small groups, regardless of health status, and to cover every eligible member of the group, also regardless of health status. Most of the states had already attempted to address the job-lock problem by the mid-1990s, but states could not reach the majority of the population with health insurance because they were covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. ""HIPAA basically ratified what most states had already done,"" said Joel Ario, a former Pennsylvania  state insurance commissioner who helped implement the ACA for the federal government. HIPAA also tried to smooth the transition from employer-based insurance to individual coverage by requiring insurers to offer coverage to people who exhausted their post-employment COBRA benefits. (COBRA, short for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, was a 1986 law that allowed workers to continue to purchase their employer plans at full cost for up to 18 months.) But HIPAA did not address how much insurers could charge for those plans, and many insurance companies tried to deter enrollment by making premiums unaffordable for nearly anyone who qualified. While the group-to-individual conversion problem was the most glaring gap in HIPAA, it was not the only one. HIPAA did not require employers to offer health coverage nor did it require those who did offer coverage to offer a minimum package of benefits. Most of those gaps were addressed by the ACA. It effectively required large employers to provide a minimum package of benefits (or else pay a substantial fine). The ACA also, for the first time, required insurers to sell policies to individuals with preexisting conditions — without charging them more. Much of HIPAA was written into the health law, making the relationship between the two measures even more complicated. Our ruling In this statement, Coons suggested that that ACA provided pre-existing condition protections to the more than 150 million Americans who get their health coverage through their place of employment.   But that is not completely correct. Those were already in place through HIPAA, though expanded by the ACA.

Providence economic development director James Bennett says the numbers “are going up” at T.F. Green Airport
","
To demonstrate that progress has been made in Rhode Island during his first two years in office, Gov. Lincoln Chafee released a YouTube video on Jan. 1 that featured various officials talking about economic development, education and regulatory reform.

One of those officials is James Bennett, Providence's director of economic development. On the video, he talks about how Chafee has helped lower costs for airlines, making it less expensive for people to fly in and out of T.F. Green Airport. ""Our numbers are going up at the airport,"" he says.

Most of the news reports we've seen about passenger traffic at Green have not been encouraging, so we called Bennett's office to find out where he was getting his numbers.

While we waited, we went to the Rhode Island Airport Corporation's website, which posts monthly reports on passenger traffic at Green.

As of the end of November, passenger traffic at the airport was down 6.5 percent for 2012 compared with what it was during the first 11 months of 2011.

The only months that showed increases over the previous year were January and February.

On a year-to-year basis, the number of passengers going through the airport has been dropping steadily since the peak of 5.7 million in 2005. The number in 2011 was 3.9 million.

That's an annual decline of 6.3 percent, or a drop of 32.2 percent over six years.

The December number has not been released yet, but in order for the airport to have ended 2012 with more passengers than in 2011, traffic in December would need to have been 80 percent higher than it was in December 2011.

When Bennett got back to us via e-mail, he said he wasn't talking about passenger traffic at all: ""What I was referring to in my comments was the increased capacity of 450 additional seats a day or 13,500 extra seating capacity a month out of Green with JetBlue,"" which began service at the airport on Nov. 29.

We wrote back to Bennett asking, ""What's the point of having extra seats if they're not being filled?""  He responded:  ""In my experience in business the basic idea of supply and demand will bring prices down and after 30 days I'm hopeful that adding JetBlue supply will increase demand and therefore bullish on stopping the downward trend previous to November 29 2012.""

To double check Bennett’s number of available seats, we called the Airport Corporation.

It turns out that, on a year-to-year-basis, the number of available airplane seats isn't up, even with the addition of JetBlue. Just the opposite, the seat count has been falling rapidly.

According to data provided by Peter Frazier, the interim president and CEO of the corporation, the average number of airplane seats each weekday, which is the how the airport tracks such data, was down nearly 10 percent in December 2012 compared with December of the previous year.

In fact, the decline has been in the double digits for nine of the last twelve months.

We also looked at month-to-month changes. They tend to be all over the map due to seasonal fluctuations.

The number of seats in December, after JetBlue service began, did rise by 179 (or 3 percent) compared with November. But the number will drop below pre-JetBlue levels in January 2013, if the airlines stick to their published schedules -- a reduction in 558 seats or a 9 percent drop.

But Frazier said month-to-month seat number comparisons are risky. ""We wouldn't do that. The industry doesn't do that. There's so much fluctuation,"" he  said. ""Sure the numbers aren't higher, but the rate of decrease has definitely slowed with JetBlue's presence.""

But, once again, that doesn't mean there will be passengers to fill those seats.

""I'm more focused on getting people on the plane,"" said Frazier. ""Typically, when you say your 'numbers are going up' at the airport, you're not saying the number of seats.""

Our ruling

James Bennett said, ""Our numbers are going up at the airport.""

When experts talk about the success of an airport, they look at the number of passengers using the facility, not the number of seats available to purchase.

We believe the vast majority of viewers of Chafee’s YouTube video will come away believing that, when Bennett reports that ""our numbers are going up,"" he is reporting that passenger volume is up.

In fact -- as The Journal has repeatedly reported -- the opposite is true. The passenger numbers have been dropping for years.

Maybe the addition of JetBlue will reverse the downward trend.

But the impression Bennett is giving in the video is so at odds from the facts, the judges rate his statement Pants on Fire.

Rick Scott says debt was up $5.2B under Charlie Crist, down $2B under Scott
","
Gov. Rick Scott is decking Charlie Crist on Florida’s debt. 
Speculation abounds that Crist, who recently became a Democrat but was a Republican when he served as governor, will challenge Scott’s 2014 re-election bid. 
""In the four years before I became governor, we increased state debt $5.2 billion. We've paid it down $2 billion,"" Scott said in response to a question about possibly running against Crist during a December interview with CBS-4 Miami. ""That’s going to cost you money down the road, so we’re doing the right thing.""

Scott’s talking point on the debt is part of a broader strategy to contrast the dour economy Florida experienced during the Crist years with the state’s turnaround since 2011.

PolitiFact Florida wanted to check Scott’s arithmetic and evaluate the point he’s trying to make about each leader’s influence on the debt. 
It’s going to be fun -- don’t reach for your Facebook tab!

Debt downlow

We hear a lot about the perils of the $16.4 trillion national debt, accumulated over years of the federal government borrowing money to pay for the cost of running the country.

State debt is a very different animal.

Unlike the federal government, Florida is bound by law to balance its budget every year. However, the state is allowed to borrow money to pay for capital improvement projects, such as university buildings, roads and environmental preservation.

There are a few different ways to talk about state debt. There’s the overall total for outstanding debt, which was $26.2 billion as of June 30, 2012.

But within that are two categories. The largest chunk ($21.6 billion in 2012) is called ""net-tax supported debt,"" which is accrued when the state issues bonds to raise money for spending projects. The smaller part ($4.6 billion in 2012) is ""self-supporting debt,"" which is accrued by bonds that come with a revenue source, such as toll roads and dorm construction.

This is our second check on Scott and the state debt. In 2011, we rated his claim that Florida’s debt was $23 million as True, even though he was referring to net tax-supported debt and not total debt. Experts told us then it was okay for him to use that figure.

This time, Scott appears to be referring to the total outstanding debt.

Whose debt is it anyway?

Just as there are different ways to count the debt, there are different ways to assign responsibility for it.

We can figure out how much debt Florida accumulated during the Crist years by looking through the archives of the Division of Bond Finance, which publishes an annual report on the debt picture. Scott's press office directed us to the division's most recent Debt Affordability Report. 
Using that, we created a chart to show the total outstanding debt (in billions of dollars) over recent fiscal years. 
But some experts told us the better way to compare debt between governors is by examining the budgets over which the governor actually had control to veto spending.

Crist was elected in 2006 and took office in January 2007. That means the first budget he signed -- which included projects in need of bond financing -- covered the 2008 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2008. The last budget Crist signed was for the 2011 fiscal year, which ended six months into Scott’s tenure.

So, to some experts, it’s more accurate to assess the growth of the debt under Crist from FY 2008 to FY 2011. This method produces an increase of $3.4 billion in debt, which is still large but not as big as the $5.2 billion that Scott claimed.

Scott gets the same treatment. He took office in January 2011, so the first budget he signed covered the budget year running July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. Under this measure, Scott reduced the debt only $1.5 billion.

All of that said, no one denies the total debt fell sharply with Scott, who is famously debt-averse. It’s short of his $2 billion talking point now, but it probably won’t be when we get an analysis of debt from the 2012-13 budget, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of tax research.

""He’s only had one year that’s been reflected, but certainly I think we’ll find that last year was a relatively low bonding year as well,"" Wenner said.

We should note there’s still another way to analyze debt: debt actually issued by a governor. We won’t go through all the numbers here, because they’re yet again different from the numbers Scott used. But they do reflect the same trend of debt rising under Crist and dropping under Scott.

What was happening?

Even during the worst of Florida’s recession, Florida borrowed money for capital projects, all the while maintaining its credit ratings with various agencies.

""We’ve been very well managed financially even during the downturn,"" said Ben Watkins, executive director of the state’s Division of Bond Finance. ""We’re very conservative.""

The sharp decline in debt is due to the state’s discontinued borrowing for acquiring conservation land and the decline of the state’s largest borrowing program, called Public Education Capital Outlay, or PECO, for public school, college and university construction projects. The decades-old program is paid for by a tax on electric, gas and telecommunications services, a source that has shriveled over recent years as Floridians conserve energy and ditch landline phones.

In 2012, there was no PECO borrowing because of a serious drop-off in collections from the tax. Higher ed advocates said the PECO shortfall signaled a ""crisis in infrastructure funding"" that would limit the state’s ability to educate college students. At the University of South Florida, for example, a new learning center has gone unfinished as it awaits more PECO money.

In his first year, Scott vetoed $474 million in bonds, including dozens of improvement and  construction projects at state colleges and universities. Scott lowered debt issuance to $416 million, its lowest level since 1990 and significantly less than the $2 billion yearly average for the previous decade.

Conversely, the rapid increase in debt after 2002 was driven mostly by the 2002 class-size amendment added to the Constitution by Florida voters that year. It required the Legislature to reduce class sizes by adding more classrooms. It cost the state $2.5 billion to build more class space, which included $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds, said David Jacobson, a spokesman for Moody’s Investors Service. That program is essentially over, he said, which contributes to the debt falling.

As education commissioner, Crist said he supported the goal of reducing class size but was concerned with costs.

Eric Draper, executive director of Audubon of Florida, said he hopes Scott allows the state to issue more debt for land conservation this year because it makes long-term sense.

""As you’re building houses, they need parks, clean water,"" he said. ""Somebody’s got to pay to preserve the land where the water comes from.""

So far, the Scott administration has tried to get rid of state land, with the Department of Environmental Protection at one time proposing to sell off $50 million worth of land.

""Under Gov. Crist, we didn’t see a proposal like that,"" Draper said. ""(He) was a big supporter of the state’s land acquisition programs. Gov. Scott has been markedly less encouraging.""

Experts in a Bloomberg story called Florida’s drastic debt reduction a ""pretty rare achievement"" that sets Florida apart from the five most populous states.

Our ruling

We give Scott some credit for his broader point about the debt’s steady rise under Crist and sharp decline under his tenure.

But the numbers he uses are not accurate if you consider the budget years over which Crist could have exerted any control.

Moreover, some bonds Florida issued were to pay for programs in the works before Crist took over, or the Legislature shares at least some of the blame for putting it in the budget. 
Finally, there was a spike in the debt after 2002 that was driven by a constitutional amendment to limit class sizes. Voters approved that measure, and the state government was required to put it into action.

Son of Sikh temple mass shooting victim: 34 gun murders in U.S. each day
","
After his father and five other worshippers were killed Aug. 5, 2012, in a mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, Pardeep Kaleka joined a national campaign to address gun violence.

Kaleka’s father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, died trying to stop gunman Wade Michael Page, who also wounded four other people, including a police officer, before killing himself.

Pardeep Kaleka took part in promoting Demand a Plan, an effort to press President Barack Obama and Congress to develop a plan to counter gun violence.

Kaleka spoke in a one-minute video posted on Demand a Plan’s website on Dec. 17, 2012 -- two months after three people were shot to death at a suburban Milwaukee salon and three days after 26 people were gunned down at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

He ended his plea by saying:

""Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns. That’s 48,000 Americans murdered with guns during President Obama’s next term. I need to know what our leaders are going to do to stop the gun violence. I demand a plan.""

Let’s check the 34 Americans murdered figure, a statistic repeated by Kaleka’s brother, Amardeep Kaleka, in his own video on the website.

Shootings spurred campaign

The shooting at the Sikh temple, located in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, is one of at least 62 mass shootings in the U.S. in the past 30 years, according to a December 2012 article in Mother Jones. Most of the killers were mentally ill and obtained their guns legally, the liberal magazine reported.

Demand a Plan was launched in July 2012 after 12 people were shot dead earlier that month at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. The sponsor of the campaign is Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national group that includes Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

The mayors group, headed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, backs legislation that would, among other things, require every gun buyer to pass a criminal background check; and ban military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

Similar claim checked

The claim Kaleka makes in his video was also made in December 2012 by Democrat Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, N.J., on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanapoulos."" PolitiFact New Jersey rated it Mostly True.

Our colleagues found that, between 2005 and 2009, an average of 34 Americans were killed by guns each day. The figure, which doesn't include suicides or accidents, is from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But more recent figures from the CDC, which tracks the causes of deaths for U.S. residents, had been released in September 2012. The newer figures show that, for 2006 through 2010, the five-year rolling average for gun homicides dropped to 33.

In 2010 alone, there were 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606), undetermined (252), or legal intervention/war (344).

PolitiFact New Jersey also pointed out that, on an annual basis, the gun homicide figure is dropping. An average of 30 people were killed in 2010 and the preliminary figure for 2011 is also 30.

That's down from the average of 35 in 2006, the highest year of the decade.

Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Demand a Plan, told us the number of gun homicides might be declining because of improvements in medical care have resulted in more lives being saved.

She cited a December 2012 news article in The Wall Street Journal. The article said that the number of people shot in the U.S. is increasing, but the percentage who die is decreasing. The article quoted experts as saying improvement in medical care is a major factor in the decline in gun homicides.

Our rating

As part of a national campaign to address gun violence, Pardeep Kaleka, the son of a Wisconsin gun homicide victim, said: ""Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns.""

The average for 2010, the most recent year for which complete figures are available, was 30. But the latest rolling five-year average, the type of measure Kaleka used, was 33, slightly less than what Kaleka claimed.

We rate his statement Mostly True.

Chris Christie says New Jersey faced an $11 billion deficit in fiscal year 2011
","
Hurricane Sandy held much of the focus of Gov. Chris Christie’s State of the State address Tuesday, but New Jersey’s economic woes weren’t totally forgotten.

Christie talked repeatedly of Garden State resilience and making the tough choices, from tenure reform to hardline collective bargaining to dealing with huge amounts of debt.

""In fiscal year 2011, the picture was even worse: a projected $11 billion deficit – on a budget of $29 billion – in percentage terms, the worst in America,"" Christie told a packed statehouse in Trenton as he reviewed the state’s economic landscape. He also noted that as in previous years, the state budget was balanced without raising taxes.

Tuesday’s address marks the fourth time since 2011 that PolitiFact New Jersey has heard that $11 billion figure from Christie. The third time was during Christie’s keynote address in August at the Republican National Convention in Florida.

As we did in August, we’re looking only at the claim of an $11 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2011 and the budget being balanced.

First, Christie has balanced the budget every budget year, as required by the state Constitution. So, that claim is accurate.

But there’s a problem with his claim about a projected $11 billion deficit for fiscal year 2011.

Let’s explain. The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal year 2011 budget, when Christie proposed his first spending plan.

A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded.

But the state does not have to meet all of its obligations because the budget supersedes statute.

So although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise.

That’s basically what Christie did in his first budget.
  
He skipped a  $3 billion pension payment, didn’t fully fund the school aid formula, and didn’t fully fund the state’s property tax rebate program.

When the fiscal 2012 budget year came around, New Jersey still had a projected structural deficit, of about $10.5 billion.

But Christie dismissed that calculation, calling it the ""old way of budgeting.""

In a 2011 budget speech, Christie said the projected deficit ""assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday’s New Jersey.""
  
The next year Christie said, ""the baseline is zero"" for budgeting.

That’s one way of making an $11 billion deficit ‘disappear.’

Our ruling

Christie said in his State of the State address that New Jersey in fiscal budget year 2011 faced a projected $11 billion budget. The governor also said that he, with the Legislature’s help, was able to balance the budget.

The state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation.

But the deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie used to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting. Now, ""the baseline is zero"" for budgeting, the governor has said.

That’s important context Christie’s statement lacks. As it did in previous fact-checks, this statement rates Half True.

Bill Seitz says Ohio's judges are woefully underpaid compared to other states
","
Ohio's 129th General Assembly ended its two-year session in December after acting on dozens of measures during a busy, post-election lame-duck period. 
One proposal that never reached consideration as legislation, however, was a plan to give a cost-of-living pay increase to state and local elected officials.

Sen. Bill Seitz, a Republican from Cincinnati, pushed for an increase that would have taken effect Jan. 1, 2014, if the legislature appropriated enough money in the next biennial budget to cover the cost.

Seitz, who had earlier supported raises for judges, noted that judges, legislators, county commissioners, sheriffs, prosecutors and other elected officials have had no increase in pay since January 2008. Those increases were the result of a bill, passed by the legislature in 2000, which enacted pay raises for the next eight years equal to the consumer price index or 3 percent.

""This is the price you pay to get qualified people to do consequential things,"" Seitz told the Columbus Dispatch. ""Study after study has shown that our judges, compared to other similar states, are being woefully underpaid.""

Senate President Tom Niehaus and House Speaker Bill Batchelder let Seitz's proposal die in caucus, but PolitiFact Ohio was still interested in his statement about the comparatively low level of judicial pay.

We called Seitz's office to ask for background. They didn't get back to us during a holiday week, but our own search turned up several supporting sources.

Chief among them was the ""Survey of Judicial Salaries,"" which has been published annually for nearly 30 years by the National Center for State Courts.

The most recent survey, published last July, found that Ohio ranked 41st among the 50 states in average pay for common pleas judges, or general jurisdiction trial courts. The national average pay for common pleas judge was $137,000 in 2011, compared to $121,350 in Ohio.

Ohio's Supreme Court ranked 33rd in pay, with an annual salary of $141,600. The pay for Ohio’s appellate judges ranked 30th, at $132,000.

That put Ohio in the bottom half for each category, according to the NCSC, which noted that Ohio judges have not had a raise since 2008.

(Salaries for full-time municipal court judges are $114,100 while part-time municipal court judges and county court judges have annual salaries of $65,650.)

A 2011 report from the Ohio Judicial Conference found that the pay for judges at the Supreme Court, appeals courts and common pleas courts in Ohio was below pay levels in the ""peer states"" of Illinois, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania. 
And a 2011 analysis from the NCSC on judicial pay in Massachusetts included what it called the ""startling"" finding that judges' salaries in the Bay State ""fare worse than every other industrial state except Ohio.""

What's the verdict on Seitz’s statement?

Saying that Ohio's judges are ""woefully underpaid"" is a matter of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can't rate. That’s a point for clarification.

But Seitz was accurate in asserting that Ohio's judges are paid less ""compared to other similar states."" They are, in fact, paid less at every level than are judges in most other states.

Atlanta mayor shifts on same-sex marriage
","
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed’s recent decision to say ""yes"" to gay marriage took place after a long and sometimes rocky relationship with the city’s supporters of same-sex marriage.

Reed previously supported civil unions -- a position that brought him grief during the 2009 mayoral election. One news account said he drew jeers during a forum hosted by gay political groups, and his support in neighborhoods with large gay populations flagged.

The pressure intensified in May when President Barack Obama announced he supported same-sex marriage. In December, the City Council cornered Reed into taking a stand by passing a resolution echoing the president’s position. The mayor had to decide whether to sign it.

Reed responded with an enthusiastic ""I do.""

""Loving couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, should have the right to marry whomever they want,"" Reed said in a Dec. 11 news release. He also announced he would join Mayors for the Freedom to Marry.

Certainly Reed’s position has shifted. Some pundits have already labeled it a flip-flop. But we here at PolitiFact have learned that elected officials stake out their positions very carefully. Does his current stance count as a true flip?

We took a close look at his track record to find out.

First, a quick reminder about the Flip-O-Meter. It makes no value judgment. Some might see a flip as a sign of weakness or political opportunism, but it can also be the outcome of an earnest re-evaluation of the facts.

Reed spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs says the mayor’s stance is not a flip. She sent us a long list of his efforts to bring equal rights to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgendered people.

""Mayor Reed never championed legislation or policies against marriage equality,"" Jacobs said in an email.

Gay rights supporters agree.  They’re a powerful group in Atlanta, which has one of the largest LGBT populations in the country. Local politicians actively vie for their vote.

Reed consistently told them that his religious views kept him from supporting same-sex marriage, but they did not recall any instance where he said he opposed it.

In fact, they give him credit for his 2004 opposition to Senate Resolution 595, which placed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage on the ballot.

It was a bold stand at a time when supporting LGBT rights was a much greater political risk than it is today. The resolution passed the state Senate and House with more than two-thirds majorities. The ballot measure passed with the support of more than 75 percent of Georgia voters.

""He really was a quiet player in that fight, as were many members,"" said state. Rep. Karla Drenner of Avondale Estates, a Reed supporter who led the fight against the amendment.

And while a vote against the ban was not a vote for same-sex marriage, the amendment’s defeat would have left the door open to it, said Jeff Graham, executive director of the LGBT rights group Georgia Equality.

""In the biggest, most public debate in Georgia, he did vote against putting an amendment on the ballot that restricted rights,"" Graham said.

Reed did take other positions that were supportive of gay rights. For instance, as a member of the state House of Representatives, he supported an anti-hate crimes measure that cleared the General Assembly but was ultimately struck down in court.

And for all the complaints Reed received for backing civil unions, he favored unprecedented recognition for same-sex commitments in Georgia. Civil unions arguably provide the same benefits as marriage.

This LGBT-friendly track record could lead one to think that Reed’s move from civil unions to same-sex marriage was a subtle shift.

But in Atlanta politics, it’s pivotal.

Reed’s reluctance to support same-sex marriage could have easily lost him the tight 2009 mayoral race, said Laura Douglas-Brown, editor and co-founder of The Georgia Voice, an LGBT newspaper. He won with a mere 700 votes over same-sex marriage supporter Mary Norwood.

Members of the city’s sizable LGBT voting bloc said they abandoned Reed because of his stance, and Norwood trounced him in District 6’s gay neighborhoods.  

""He felt it had hurt him, but he wasn’t going to change his position because of politics,"" Douglas-Brown said.

Reed’s switch was a momentous shift on a personal level as well. His statements indicate he has been grappling with his convictions for years. After Obama’s announcement, he issued a statement that said he was ""still wrestling"" with his ""own personal beliefs on the issue of (gay) marriage.""  

Our ruling:

Before supporting same-sex marriage, Reed was a consistent supporter of civil unions despite intense pressure from LGBT voters. During the 2009 race, he dug in his heels, even though it meant losing the support of this crucial voting bloc.

PolitiFact defines a Full Flop as ""a major reversal of position."" Reed’s change fits the bill.",/factchecks/2013/jan/09/kasim-reed/atlanta-mayor-shifts-same-sex-marriage/

Pro-Israel group's ad depicts Obama and Hagel disagreeing on Iran
","
President Barack Obama’s nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., as defense secretary is expected to create a hotly contested fight about his comments on Israel and Iran.

Pro-Israel hawks have cast a portrait of Hagel as too soft on Iran and not chummy enough with Israel. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said a day before the Jan. 7 announcement that if confirmed, Hagel would be ""the most antagonistic secretary of defense towards the State of Israel in our nation's history.""

The Hagel nomination comes two months after Obama won re-election amid much debate about Obama’s relationship with Israel. Obama still won the vast majority of the Jewish vote, but by less than 2008. 

The Emergency Committee for Israel, a pro-Israel group whose board members include high-profile conservatives Bill Kristol and Gary Bauer, aired an ad in December attacking Hagel, even before Obama officially announced his pick to replace Leon Panetta who is retiring.

""Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel?"" asks a disgusted sounding narrator. ""President Obama says he supports sanctions on Iran. Hagel voted against them. Hagel voted against labeling Iran’s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group. And while President Obama says all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran, Hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option. President Obama, for secretary of defense Chuck Hagel is not a responsible option.""

There are a lot of claims in that ad, but we wanted to check if Obama and Hagel disagreed about military options for preventing a nuclear Iran. We contacted the Emergency Committee for Israel about the ad and did not get a response.

We also did not get a response from the White House. But in a press briefing the day Obama announced his nomination of Hagel, White House spokesman Jay Carney defended Hagel as a ""staunch supporter of Israel"" and ""a supporter of the broad sanctions regime that this President has put into place against Iran... .""

Hagel told a newspaper in his home state of Nebraska that critics have distorted his views on Israel and Iran, but he did not directly address whether he would favor striking Iran.

Obama has said regularly that he leaves all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. Here’s a representative comment from the 2012 AIPAC conference: ""I have said that when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I will take no options off the table, and I mean what I say. That includes all elements of American power: A political effort aimed at isolating Iran; a diplomatic effort to sustain our coalition and ensure that the Iranian program is monitored; an economic effort that imposes crippling sanctions; and, yes, a military effort to be prepared for any contingency.""

Hagel’s record

Hagel, a decorated Vietnam veteran, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in Nebraska in 1996 and served two terms, including serving on the Foreign Relations Committee before he retired in 2008.

Hagel’s experiences on the battlefront made him cautious about war. ""I'm not a pacifist. I believe in using force but only after a very careful decision-making process. … I will do everything I can to avoid needless, senseless war,"" he said in an interview with Vietnam magazine.

Hagel voted to give President George W. Bush the authority to go to war against Afghanistan and Iraq but was later critical of those wars, creating a wedge between him and the GOP, including a rebuke from former Vice President Dick Cheney.

Hagel also drew fire for comments he made in 2006 to author and former State Department Mideast peace negotiator Aaron David Miller. ""The Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here,"" Hagel said, but ""I'm a United States senator. I'm not an Israeli senator.""

Miller recently wrote that accusations that Hagel is anti-semitic ""is shameful and scurrilous."" 
While some of Hagel’s views are out of sync with current U.S. policy, it won’t matter because Obama controls foreign policy, Miller wrote.

Hagel on Iran

The ad attacking Hagel cites a Dec. 13, 2012, article from the Washington Post leaving the viewer to believe that Hagel made that statement about Iran on the eve of his nomination. But the Post article recapped various Hagel comments -- including that particular one, which actually goes back to 2006.

We did our own research and reviewed multiple comments Hagel made in speeches and interviews between 2005 and 2012. We found that Hagel repeatedly called on the U.S. to engage Iran in direct discussions and expressed concern that a military attack on Iran could lead to widespread counter-attacks.

But his caution was at least in part borne from the fact that we were already engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

On CNN in April 2006, an interviewer asked Hagel if diplomacy failed, if the U.S. should pursue a military strike.

Hagel’s response including these comments: ""Well, first of all, I think we have to recognize that this Iranian issue does represent a real threat to the United States. ... unlike Iraq. This is a real legitimate issue. And I think, before we charge off in going off to another war -- we're in two of them now, in Afghanistan and Iraq -- we'd better think through this one carefully and clearly. I think it's going to require an engagement directly with the Iranians.""

Later in 2006, Hagel visited Pakistan.

Pakistani Press International reported that Hagel ruled out any military action against Iran. ""I do not expect any kind of military solution on the Iran issue,"" Hagel said, adding President George W. Bush and senior members of his cabinet had said the military option was not a responsible approach to resolving the issues. ""I think to further comment on it would be complete speculation, but I would say that a military strike against Iran, a military option, is not a viable, feasible, responsible option.""’ (This is the comment the ad directly quotes.)

In 2012, Hagel still expressed caution about military intervention, but didn’t specifically rule it out.

In a March 2012 interview with the news website Al-Monitor, Hagel said that we should not be locked into one of two options or ""false choices.""

The interviewer then suggested as a false choice: ""Bomb Iran or live with Iran with a bomb?""

Hagel responded: ""Exactly. We may eventually wind up with those choices. But I don’t think we’re there now. We’ve got some time, keep ratcheting up the sanctions, keep the world community with you. … You cannot push the Iranians into a corner where they can’t get out …You’ve got to find some quiet ways – and you don’t do this in the press or by giving speeches – to give them a couple of facing saving ways out of this thing so they get something out of this, too. And recognizing internally what’s going on in Iran; things are not going particularly well. Let that play out… So you work this thing on a number of parallel tracks.""

Hagel criticized the Republican presidential candidates, saying ""they can hardly race to say who would bomb Iran first; it’s just amazing.""

In a September 2012, Hagel co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed that specifically included military options: ""Our position is fully consistent with the policy of presidents for more than a decade of keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force, thereby increasing pressure on Iran while working toward a political solution. Since the consequences of a military attack are so significant for U.S. interests, we seek to ensure that the spectrum of objectives, as well as potential consequences, is understood.""

Our ruling

The Emergency Committee for Israel said in an ad, ""And while President Obama says all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran Hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option.""

Obama clearly has said all options are on the table. But the ad portrays Hagel’s comments as occurring in December 2012, he actually stated them in 2006. In the past, Hagel did repeatedly warn against jumping into another war and called for discussions with Iran, but the comments the ad cites were made when the United States was engaged in war in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2012 in an op-ed he co-wrote, Hagel called for ""keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force, thereby increasing pressure on Iran while working toward a political solution.""

Rick Scott ignores flaws in state study, says Medicaid expansion will cost Florida $26 billion
","
Gov. Rick Scott is using a questionable state ""study"" as evidence that the federal health care law will cost the state billions of additional dollars.

In an guest editorial written for the Tampa Bay Times on Sunday, and again on Monday during a Washington, D.C., press conference, Scott cited a state analysis that says the health care law would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over the next 10 years.

The money would be needed, Scott says, to pay for expanding Medicaid, a government-run health insurance program for the poor.

""As you know Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration put out their estimate of what the expansion would cost just for Florida taxpayers and it's over $26 billion,"" Scott told Washington reporters after meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

Don’t believe that number.

In this case, the Agency for Health Care Administration -- an agency Scott directs -- did indeed release a presentation that concluded that Florida taxpayers would be asked to pay $25.8 billion over 10 years to implement an expansion of the Medicaid system.

But the state study relies on questionable or downright misleading assumptions to reach its eye-popping figure.

We can’t say what the cost will be to the state -- and if there will even be one. Outside groups such as the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, have estimated the additional cost to the state would be a little more than $1 billion between 2013 and 2022.

The state figure, however, ignores a fundamental component of the health care law -- namely that the federal government will pay for most of the expansion.

This requires a little bit of explanation, so bear with us.

One of the key components of the new federal law, and one of the components that Scott and Republicans particularly dislike, is that most Americans will be required to have some form of health insurance or pay a penalty.

As a result, the federal government wants to expand Medicaid coverage to cover more Americans who are poor.

States, which manage Medicaid, can decide whether to expand the program or not, but to make the option enticing, the federal government offered to pick up most of the costs to cover more people.

Over the past 20 years, the federal government has paid for about 58 percent of the costs for current Medicaid recipients. Under the expansion, the government would pay 100 percent of the costs for newly eligible Medicaid recipients for the first three years (2014-16). In 2017, the federal government would cover 95 percent of the costs, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond.

Why is this breakdown so important?

Because the state study ignores it completely.

The state study calculates the cost of the expansion based on the federal government paying for only about 58 percent of the costs. 
Also, the most recent cost estimate from the state -- which was published in December -- includes revisions that only add to the theoretical state bill, according to our analysis. Among them:

• In a January 2012 report, the state assumed people who are now eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled would slowly transition into the health care program over a period of three years. In the most recent report, the state said they would all enter Medicaid immediately.

• Similarly, the January 2012 report concluded that just 40 percent of newly eligible Medicaid recipients would enter the system in 2014. By December 2012, the number had been revised up to 60 percent. 
It’s hard to quantify the dollar impact on any one change based on the information provided by the state in its estimates. 
When we asked for details on these assumptions, Michelle Dahnke, a spokesperson for the Agency for Health Care Administration, said the state simply wanted to be as cautious as possible with its estimates. 
But state officials were aware that the estimates were off even as Scott repeated the numbers in Washington, according to emails obtained by Carol Gentry of Health News Florida, part of WUSF Media. The Health News Florida report noted that J. Eric Pridgeon, on the staff of the House Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, questioned the study almost immediately. On Dec. 20, three days after the study was released, Pridgeon wrote state agency officials saying that the federal revenues for Medicaid expansion are part of the Affordable Care Act and cannot be omitted. 
In response to criticism of the estimates, Scott spokesperson Melissa Sellers issued a statement defending them but noting, ""Others have asked AHCA to use different assumptions to calculate different cost estimates. We look forward to reviewing those cost estimates as well."" 
The inflated estimates seem to be part of a pattern. Last summer, Scott claimed a Medicaid expansion would cost $1.9 billion a year. PolitiFact Florida looked into that number at the time and concluded that the estimate ""appears to be wildly high."" We rated his statement False.

Our ruling

There is no doubt that Medicaid represents a significant part of the state’s budget, and that any plan to expand the system -- no matter how much the federal government pays for -- could include additional costs to the state.

But rather than have a fact-based discussion about the state’s responsibilities when it comes to health care, it appears that Scott and his staff are making strange assumptions to make the estimates higher than they actually will be.

This is also a case where Scott cannot simply hide behind the fact that he is accurately citing a ""study."" His office directed the analysis, and it was notified that the assumptions were questionable.

Scott gets a pass on one thing: The cost to expand Medicaid is largely unknown. But using a study to say that the expansion of Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers ""over $26 billion"" is False.",/factchecks/2013/jan/08/rick-scott/rick-scott-ignores-flaws-state-study-says-medicaid/

Medical group says 31 percent of Texas doctors accept all new Medicaid patients, down from 67 percent in 2000
","
New Medicaid patients may struggle to land a Texas physician willing to accept that coverage, a medical group suggests.

The Texas Medical Association, whose membership includes nearly 46,000 physicians and medical students, said in a Dec. 7, 2012, tweet: ""Only 31% of Texas physicians accept all new #Medicaid patients compared to 67% in 2000.""

We soon learned the figures, indicating a possible plummet in patient access, traced to doctor surveys, not government or other records.

Some 67 percent of the state’s physicians accepted Medicaid at least once during a recent 12-month period, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Agency spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us by email that 34,290 Texas physicians had claims paid by Medicaid in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. According to the Texas Medical Board, there were nearly 51,000 practicing physicians in the state at about that time.

Goodman said she did not have information on the share of physicians not accepting all new Medicaid patients.

Brent Annear, a medical association spokesman, guided us to a March 2012 web post by the group stating that 27,917 physicians and medical residents were asked to fill out its online survey and the group fielded 1,139 responses, a 4 percent response rate. The group’s ""preliminary findings"" document says the respondents were a ""representative sample"" of all physicians. The survey reached members and non-members, the association’s Donna Kinney, who oversaw the survey, told us by email.

The results: 96 percent of responding physicians said they were generally accepting new patients, but only 31 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients, compared to 42 percent in the group’s 2010 and 2008 surveys. In another 2012 response, 51 percent said they could take on more privately-insured patients in accord with federal health reform, but not more Medicaid patients.

The key question lists physician reimbursement methods including private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. ""For patients covered by the following payers,"" the question says, ""does your practice currently (1) accept all new patients, (2) limit new patients that you will accept, or (3) accept no new patients?"" In reply, 26 percent said they limit their new Medicaid patients and 44 percent said they decline all new Medicaid patients, compared to 32 percent in 2010.

Bexar County physicians were most likely to accept all new Medicaid patients; 47 percent marked that choice. But less than 30 percent of physicians in the counties of Dallas, Tarrant, Harris and Travis, which was at 22 percent, said they accept all new Medicaid patients. In the state’s rural counties, 43 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients.

Annear said by email that physicians have difficulties with Medicaid’s rates and bureaucratic hurdles that delay payments. The rates decreased four times from 2000 to 2011, an association spokeswoman, Pam Udall, said by email, though the state also agreed to a 25-percent boost in funds covering certain physician services provided to children on Medicaid, as part of resolving a lawsuit.

We asked Kinney to speculate on why nearly 70 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim in a recent year. She said about 60 percent of the state’s physicians--including many specialists in radiology, pathology and anesthesiology--must accept Medicaid to maintain their hospital admitting privileges. Those kinds of doctors would have responded to the survey by saying they limit new Medicaid patients, she said by phone.

Wondering if the 2012 results could fairly be compared with the 2000 outcomes, we asked if the question’s wording had changed over the years. Kinney said it had not and also that each sample matches the demographics of physicians statewide--with the exception that fewer surveys are filled out by younger doctors, making for a slight, consistent skew through the years of surveying.

For outside perspective, we turned to Florida-based pollster Dave Beattie, who called the survey methodology ""standard,"" and Austin pollster Jeff Smith, who told us by phone that his firm once conducted the survey and that his concern all along has been that in contrast to traditional polls, in which the pollster entirely picks whom to question, respondents to the association survey are self-selected. Results are influenced, he said, by which recipients click through to reply.

""This is not a random sample,"" Smith said, adding: ""It’s an imperfect world. You can’t ever have a truly random sample.""

Kinney said that because the overall survey covers various topics, there is not much self-selection bias in relation to any one question.

For a ""real-world"" take, we ran the 2012 survey result by Austin opthalmologist Michelle Berger, the 2013 president of the Travis County Medical Society, which is affiliated with the medical association.

Berger said by phone that the society frequently fields inquiries from individuals newly on Medicaid seeking a doctor. Berger said she stopped accepting new Medicaid patients in her practice because related paperwork proved onerous and government payments, which have not kept up with inflation, were not quickly forthcoming. Then again, she said, doctors who do not accept new Medicaid patients may still provide charity care--the result being that some low-income patients are served even though their doctors do not seek payment.

Finally, we circled back to Udall about the group’s tweet not saying that the cited percentages were based only on survey responses. ""It is a fact,"" Udall said by email, since the results reflected a representative sample of physicians.

Our ruling

The association’s tweet said 31 percent of physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, compared to 67 percent in 2000. These figures were based on poll responses rather than a harder indicator--and the clarification that they came from a poll was missing from the Twitter post.

"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Voting Record', 'Amy Kremer']","
Chambliss not a true conservative, critic says
","
Is U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss actually down with the Democrats?

A Georgia-based tea party leader made the assertion about the veteran Republican lawmaker during a recent segment on CNN. 
Amy Kremer, chair of the Tea Party Express, was angry with Chambliss for voting for a bill to avert the so-called ""fiscal cliff."" Many conservatives have complained the deal does little to slow spending, but raises income taxes on the wealthiest Americans.

""I live in the state of Georgia and Saxby Chambliss is going to be primaried, our own senator. It's unacceptable to have somebody that votes with the Democrats more than they do with the conservatives,"" Kremer said. ""And he has proven time and time again, he's all about the spending, and we're a red state, we deserve a conservative senator.""

PolitiFact Georgia was curious about the claim that Chambliss ""votes with the Democrats"" more than conservatives. Is there any truth to that in this age of partisan Washington politics or were Kremer’s remarks an exaggeration?

Chambliss was a charter member of a group of a bipartisan senators that has tried in recent years to come up with solutions to the federal government’s fiscal challenges. His work with the group has drawn the suspicious eye of budget hawks and conservatives, a shift from the days he was viewed as a hero of the right after defeating DeKalb County Democrat Max Cleland for the U.S. Senate seat that Chambliss has now held since 2003. There’s been talk of Chambliss facing a Republican primary challenger when he’s up for re-election in 2014.

Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint suspects that critics are using such vitriol in hopes of lining up opposition to Chambliss in 2014.

""Somebody saying that is someone who wants a very conservative or right-wing alternative,"" Swint told us. 
So what about the accuracy of Kremer’s claim?

We couldn’t find any statistics that specifically show whether Chambliss has voted more frequently with Democrats than conservatives. There is some research that has examined how often he’s voted with Republicans. What we found shows Chambliss hasn’t strayed too far from Republicans on most issues.

Chambliss voted with fellow Republicans 91 percent of the time in 2011 and 2012, according to a Washington Post analysis. Only two Republican senators, John Cornyn of Texas and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, exceeded that percentage. And that was barely higher, at 92 percent. Chambliss voted with Republicans 95 percent of the time in 2009 and 2010, the Post reported.

Another website, Open Congress, says Chambliss votes with his party 92 percent of the time. 
Again, Cornyn and McConnell were the only Republicans currently serving in the U.S. Senate who voted with their party with greater frequency (93 percent) than Chambliss.

The Tea Party Express sent us a statement from Kremer that explained she was referring to key votes Chambliss has taken in recent years that she said ""have separated him from the true fiscal conservatives.""

""In addition to the fiscal cliff legislation that has just passed, Chambliss has repeatedly voted for big government solutions favored by Democrats … Chambliss has been on the wrong side of every one of these votes,"" Kremer wrote.

Kremer also complained in her statement that Chambliss added pork to bills in 2009 and 2010 and supported T-SPLOST, a proposed 1 percent sales tax increase to fund transportation projects in Georgia. Voters in most parts of the state overwhelmingly rejected the tax.

Some of the legislation Kremer cited that Chambliss voted in favor of, such as the 2008 Wall Street bailout, a 2008 stimulus package and Medicare Part D, were supported by then-President George W. Bush, a Republican. Some of those bills had more support from Democrats.

As for T-SPLOST, Chambliss said he was going to vote for it in the referendum because he thought it would create jobs in his hometown, Moultrie, and the surrounding area. Chambliss said his vote was not an endorsement and urged voters statewide to make up their own minds about T-SPLOST.

Chambliss has voted with Republicans against Democrats on prominent bills such as Obama administration appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court, the federal health care law, the DREAM Act for illegal immigrants, extending the Bush administration tax cuts and an audit of the Federal Reserve.

The American Conservative Union has conducted annual ratings of Congress since 1971, measuring how aligned the lawmaker is to the organization’s stance on legislation it says was important. In 2011, the most recent year available, Chambliss received a score of 80 on a scale of 100. That was lower than 27 Republican senators and tied him with three others. Chambliss’ lifetime average is 92.5, which is higher than most Republicans in the U.S. Senate. 
Chambliss said via email that some of Kremer’s claims were inaccurate. The senator defended some of his past votes, arguing he was ""voting with my Republican president and a majority of the Republican caucus.""  

""The tea party and I agree on the cause of America’s fiscal problems, and that much more needs to be done to address our country’s overspending,"" Chambliss said.

To sum up, Kremer said Chambliss votes with Democrats more than conservatives. Her point was that the senator doesn’t vote along with fiscal conservatives on key issues. There are votes by Chambliss that differed from some senators considered conservative. Chambliss, though, has voted along with conservatives on some big issues as well. His voting record shows the senator votes with his GOP colleagues more than 90 percent of the time and his lifetime average with the ACU is better than most Republicans currently serving in the Senate.

"['Rhode Island', 'Elections', 'Kenneth Block']","
Kenneth Block, chairman of Rhode Island’s Moderate Party, says 11 state legislatures meet for three months and 5 meet biennially
","
When it comes to legislative sessions, Kenneth Block, chairman of Rhode Island’s Moderate Party, says shorter is better.

In the November 2012 elections, 15 of the 38 state Senate seats and 33 of 75 House races were uncontested. Block says he thinks that’s partly because the General Assembly session can last six months, a time commitment that most working Rhode Islanders can’t make and still keep their paying jobs.

In a commentary that appeared in The Providence Journal on Dec. 16, 2012, he said the Ocean State should take a lesson from the 11 states that are obligated, usually by their state constitutions, to finish their sessions within 90 days. Or the five other states that meet every other year.

""The business of the General Assembly can and should be carried out in three calendar months,"" Block wrote. ""This would make public service in the General Assembly more accessible to a great many more Rhode Islanders - and would bring a far wider diversity of life experiences into the legislature.""

We decided to see if Block’s tally of legislatures with shorter terms was right.

But first, a little background on Rhode Island’s legislature.

Article VI, Section 3 of the the Rhode Island Constitution requires the General Assembly to open its annual session on the first Tuesday in January but puts no time limit on how many days the Assembly can be in session.

The Assembly usually meets from January to June,  generally three days a week, starting at about 4 p.m. By the time adjournment rolls around, the House has usually met a day or two more than the Senate.

Legislators usually try to adjourn as early in June as they can. Last year’s session ran through June 12 and took 64 legislative days, according to a review of the daily journals on the legislature’s website.

In the early 2000s there were years when the legislature was in session for 70 days or more, and went into July.  

When we asked Block about his figures on other legislative sessions, he said his source was the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group with offices in  Washington, D.C., and Denver,  that provides research and policy advice to state legislatures across the country.

On their website, we found a conference survey of the 50 states showing that 11 did in fact have constitutional requirements that their legislatures meet for no more than 90 calendar days. Five others meet just once every two years, for varying lengths of time.

Block argues shorter sessions would encourage more working people to consider running for legislative office. Setting a specific date or number of days would force the legislature to compress its work, he said.

But there is something else to consider.

Larry Berman, director of communications for the state House of Representatives, said Block’s focus on the January-to-June timeline is misleading because the legislature usually only meets three days a week. Other states hit those 90-day limits by meeting four or five days a week.

If the Rhode Island General Assembly met five days a week, and if it worked through the week off it usually takes in February, it could finish a 64-day session in the last week of March -- in other words, three calendar months.

Berman said that, with the legislature meeting three days a week, and starting at 4 p.m. instead of 9 or 10 a.m., it’s easier for people with day jobs to serve.

Our ruling

Ken Block said that ""Eleven states complete their [legislative] sessions within three calendar months, and another five only meet biennially.""

He argues that shorter sessions could encourage more participation.

By the calendar, counting months, Block is right. Eleven other state legislatures finish weeks before Rhode Island’s usual June adjournment. But when you count the number of days the Rhode Island General Assembly is in session, Rhode Island legislators actually work fewer days than their counterparts in some of those 90-day states.

We find the statement is ""accurate but needs clarification or additional information,"" our definition of Mostly True.

John Kasich says sewage dumped into the water at Detroit is causing big problems for Lake Erie
","
John Kasich is no Michigan fan.

Ohio’s governor hinted as much when he spoke to reporters following an Ohio Farm Bureau speech on his administration’s new nutrient management plan to help the algae-infested Grand Lake Saint Marys.

After praising farmers for their role in helping to try to stem the problems from agricultural runoff at Grand Lake Saint Marys, the Republican governor (and graduate of The Ohio State University) turned to the state shaped like a mitten, saying he was upset that waste from Detroit fouls the waters of Lake Erie.

""We made great progress in Grand Saint Marys, and we are up in the Lake Erie watershed making sure we made great progress there,"" Kasich told reporters in Nov. 29 . ""We have a problem with Detroit dumping a bunch of sewage in the lake that causes big problems...""

But is the collective waste of Kid Rock and the other 700,000 Detroit residents being dumped into Lake Erie really ""a big problem"" as Kasich has stated? We strapped on our hip boots, and waded on in.

Great Lakes experts are quick to point out that Lake Erie is particularly susceptible to pollution from farms, factories and humans because it is both the most shallow and most fish-filled of the five major lakes that that straddle the United States border with Canada.

But amid the various contaminants, what emerges as the biggest threat to the health of the lake?

The foremost expert on Lake Erie’s water quality is David Baker, the director emeritus of the National Center for Water Quality Research at Heidelberg College in Tiffin, who has studied the waters of Lake Erie for nearly 40 years.

The biggest threat to the health of the lake has come from toxic blue green algae which has appeared in recent years — most noticeably in 2011— and can turn a thriving aquaculture into a marine dead zone, according to Baker.

""I would say that the blue green algae is the biggest problem that affects the Lake and the health of the water,"" Baker said. ""The bulk of the evidence—and the widespread scientific assessment — is that the dissolved phosphorus from agricultural runoff is the primary source of the problem.""

Agricultural runoff is funneled into Lake Erie when it washes away after fierce storms, and comes more from the Maumee River near Toledo than any other place, Baker said.

And while Detroit does have a massive — and somewhat antiquated — wastewater treatment plant serving 76 communities that dumps sewage into the Lake, Baker said the algae problems did not come from Michigan.

""We can look at pictures from satellite photos that show us this pretty clearly--we just don’t see big blooms of algae moving down the Detroit River,"" Baker said.

A particularly dry spring 2012 — just a year after the worst algae blooms on record in Lake Erie — further proved this point as the blue-green algae blooms were mostly absent with no agricultural runoff after storms to feed it, according to Baker.

""In a way, last year was a great experiment, and we got to see the Lake respond rather quickly to what the loading was from the agricultural watershed,"" Baker said. ""We just did not see the widespread blue green algae blooms problem in 2012.""

Baker said that problems with waste from Detroit being dumped into the Lake Erie were ""very minor"" because the phosphorus loads from wastewater remain relatively constant over time and are relatively diluted compared to the agricultural runoff that can funnel in after a storm. ""Things are always a little bit more complicated than what can be summarized by a governor,"" Baker said.

Largely agreeing with Baker was Kristy Meyer, director of Agricultural and Clean Water Programs for the Ohio Environmental Council. Meyer said agricultural runoff is the top issue for Lake Erie, not waste from Michigan, because it accounts for nearly half the phosphorus dumped into the Lake.

""It’s always nice to have a finger to point, and why not point the finger somewhere else?"" Meyer said. She did say that both are ""big problems"" in her view.

Backing the governor’s statement was Sandy Bihn, executive director of Lake Erie Waterkeeper Inc., a non-profit advocacy and education group focused on trying to improve Lake Erie’s water quality.

Bihn said she agreed with the governor’s characterization that Detroit sewage was a big problem noting that thousands of tons of sewage sludge were dumped into the Detroit and Rouge Rivers in recent years. ""What he said is a true statement,"" she said. ""When five percent of the phosphorous is coming from one place, that is something we need to be focused on.""

Problems with sewage being dumped into Lake Erie from Michigan grew worse in the last several years when equipment began to degrade and Detroit’s government couldn’t afford to fix or replace it, Bihn said. She credited the Kasich administration with pressing Michigan officials for action on the issue of the phosphorus flowing from the wastewater treatment plant in Detroit.

So where does that leave us?

As he was talking to reporters about improving water quality at Grand Lake St. Marys, Kasich praised farmers for doing more to limit agricultural runoff. Turning to Lake Erie, Kasich blamed Michigan for ""dumping sewage"" into the Lake that causes ""big problems.""

Kasich’s statement was partially accurate. Sewage from Detroit is being dumped into Lake Erie and it does certainly contribute to water quality problems in the Lake.

But there are important details needed to fully understand the claim.

Agricultural runoff is the biggest problem facing the shallowest of the Great Lakes as it causes toxic algae blooms, according to the foremost Lake Erie water quality expert. He called the impact of Detroit’s waste floating into the lake ""very minor."" Other Lake Erie water experts, though, seemed a bit more concerned about the impact of the Detroit waste in the overall mix.

But by praising farmers for limiting pollution being dumped into waterways and then blaming Michigan in the next breath for wastewater from Detroit funneling into the Lake, Kasich’s claim downplayed the impact of agricultural runoff in the lake. That impact is an important detail needed to put the governor’s claim in context.

"['Environment', 'Energy', 'Virginia', 'Patrick Wales']","
Wales says Virginia's uranium deposits far exceed its offshore oil supply
","The General Assembly will consider a bill this winter that would end the state’s 31-year ban on uranium mining.

If approved, the state will begin drafting regulations that will allow Virginia Uranium Inc. to develop a mining and milling operation on a 3,000-acre site in Pittsylvania County. Opponents say the operation poses long-term threats to the environment and the sources of drinking water for many, including those in Virginia Beach, the state’s largest city.

Patrick Wales, project manager for Virginia Uranium, expressed confidence during a Dec. 6 symposium that the operation would be safe. He spoke enthusiastically about the project’s potential to provide jobs. And he said the abundance of uranium would produce a domestic energy source that far outstrips the oil reserves Virginia hopes to tap off its Atlantic coast.

There’s ""over 20 times more energy in this property than there is in all the oil that’s estimated to be off Virginia’s coast,"" Wales said.

That’s a big claim, so we decided to check Wales’ math.

Wales said the mining and milling would result in 119 million pounds of U308, or uranium oxide, which is the product his company will sell to electric utilities. The estimate comes from a 2008 study of the project that was commissioned by Virginia Uranium and conducted by Behre Dolbear Group Inc., Chicago, a mining engineering company..

No independent assessment of the uranium oxide yield exists. The 119 million pound estimate was cited and not questioned in a study of the risks of the mining enterprise conducted last year by the National Academy of Science.

As for oil reserves, Wales turned to estimates made by the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy when a section off the coast of Virginia was considered for a lease sale in 2008 and 2009. It was estimated that 165 million barrels of oil could be pumped from the beds. President Barack Obama eventually canceled the lease sale.

The federal government, the governor and  Sen. Mark  Warner and Sen. Jim Webb used a slightly smaller figure in 2009 and 2010 -- 130 million barrels. Estimates of the oil resources are wide-ranging. As we reported in an earlier offshore drilling claim, the surveys of the seabed off the coast are 40 to 50 years old, so all estimates are speculative.

Let’s look at the conversion from uranium and oil to the common measure for energy, the British thermal unit or Btu.

A pound of uranium oxide contains the energy equivalent of 31 barrels of fuel oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.

Under those conversions, the 119 million pounds of uranium oxide would produce as much energy as 3.7 billion barrels of oil. That dwarfs the 130 million to 165 million barrels expected to come from offshore drilling.

When we divide 3.7 billion by 165 million, we get 22.4 -- or the factor of how much more energy would come from the uranium than the estimated offshore oil.

Wales said his company has received a more recent, and higher, estimate of the project’s output from engineering firms Lyntek Inc., Lakewood, Colo., and BRS Engineering, Riverton, Wyo., at about 133 million pounds, but like the oil reserves, this wouldn’t greatly affect Wales’ statement.

Our ruling

Wales, in advocating the need and potential of a uranium mine in Southwest Virginia, called attention to its energy-production possibilities. He said the mine will yield enough uranium oxide to produce more than 20 times the power that would come from oil the state hopes to tap off Virginia’s shore.

The math works out for Wales with room to spare.  

We caution that the claim is dependent both on an estimate from the uranium project developer’s consultant and the wide-ranging, unproven estimates of oil off Virginia’s coast. Wales’ statement is based on the best available information and, as such, we rate it True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/07/patrick-wales/wales-says-virginias-uranium-deposits-far-exceed-i/

Walker says Wisconsin’s pension system is the only one in the country that’s fully funded
","
Gov. Scott Walker is used to hearing cheers from conservative audiences when highlighting fiscal constraints he put on Wisconsin’s budget in 2011.

He seemed a bit surprised, though, during his November 2012 address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library when scattered applause broke out after he mentioned the state’s pension fund.

Walker was comparing Wisconsin’s fiscal condition to that of California and of his standard punching bag, Illinois, which raised taxes to close a budget gap.

""They have a pension system that’s not even halfway funded,"" Walker said of the Land of Lincoln. ""Now, in contrast, in our state, our pension system is the only one in the country (that’s) 100 percent funded.""

Hearing some applause, Walker added: ""You can clap for that, sure.""

In 2011, much attention centered on the mandate by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature that most public employees pay a larger share of their pension costs. It was part of Walker’s controversial drive to sharply curtail collective bargaining by public-sector unions.

The health of the state-run Wisconsin Retirement System -- which serves some 166,000 retirees and 260,000 active workers, including teachers, state and municipal employees -- has received less attention.

And though Walker made the statement awhile back, it’s worth a look as we enter into the new budget season.

Is Wisconsin’s pension system the only one in the nation that’s fully funded?

To evaluate the claim, we’ll examine the two most recent years with complete data, 2010 and 2011.

The number we’re looking at is the ""funded ratio"" -- the ratio of a pension plan’s assets to its liabilities. It’s one key measure of whether a fund can meet all its future obligations. It varies with investment gains and losses, changes in benefits and other factors.

A ratio of 100 percent means the fund -- at least as of that moment -- is in position to pay future retirees all their expected benefits.

At the end of fiscal year 2010, which began before Walker took office, only Wisconsin had a fully funded pension plan (100 percent), the Pew Center on the States concluded in a widely cited June 2012 report.

Walker spoke of the report at that time, and while it’s a bit dated, the report is of recent vintage.

The Pew study noted that 34 state-run plans were below the 80 percent threshold that experts say is the minimum for a healthy system.

There was a tiny bit of rounding in the determination that Wisconsin was 100 percent funded. The actual percentage at the end of 2010, Pew found, was 99.84 percent.

The Pew Center considers that so close to 100 percent that it constitutes full funding, said Pew senior researcher David Draine.

All told, the Pew report cited a $757 billion pension funding gap among the states on liabilities of $3 trillion, noting ""serious concerns"" about funding levels in 32 states.

Illinois was lowest among the states at 45 percent in 2010.
 
We found other evidence that backed up the ranking of Wisconsin as best-funded among state plans.

That included a 2012 report by Morningstar, and a survey by the National Association of State Retirement Administrators using 2011 data that had Wisconsin as the highest-ranking state-run plan for general employees. (Some municipal plans, or state plans for just teachers or law enforcement, were healthier than Wisconsin).

For the official 2010 and 2011 Wisconsin figures, we turned to a report by the Wisconsin Retirement System’s actuarial consultant, which annually calculates the funded ratio.

The firm, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company, reported 99.8 percent funding for year-end 2010.

And for year-end 2011, the firm put the Wisconsin fund’s funded ratio at 99.9 percent, according to its latest report. The report showed the Wisconsin system at 99 percent or greater since 2003.

Rob Marchant, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Employee Trust Funds, said the Pew report that put Wisconsin at 100 percent is probably the best source for comparing the states.

Marchant added that ""100 percent funded"" is a loaded phrase that pension officials tend to avoid because various assumptions go into the calculation of a funded ratio.

So it’s not an exact science.

But the governor is on solid ground in saying the Wisconsin system is fully funded -- and the only one in the nation, to boot.

One last note: One way the fund stays healthy is adjusting the annual pension payments to retirees. They go up or down depending on the investment performance of the fund.

Because of the recession, payments for many state retirees decreased annually from 2009 to 2012 and will drop again in 2013, bringing the five-year total of cuts to $4 billion. Payments are projected to begin rising again in 2014. For a majority of retirees, payments cannot fall below what employees received upon retirement.

Gov. Scott Walker told an audience of California conservatives that ""Our pension system is the only one in the country that’s 100% funded.""

It’s slightly below 100%, but so close that a respected research organization rounds it up. And no other plan covering general state employees can make that claim.

Environment New Jersey claims Sandy is most destructive Atlantic hurricane
","Hurricane Sandy is probably the worst storm to hit New Jersey after it killed 40 people, remade parts of the Shore’s coastline and caused damages in the tens of billions of dollars.

But just how bad was it compared with other hurricanes?

""New Jersey can and must do more to slow global warming, especially after 2012's extreme weather and Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever,"" Environment New Jersey said recently on its website.

The most destructive Atlantic storm? Ever? Considering the magnitude of some other hurricanes in history, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to investigate. Doug O’Malley, interim director for Environment New Jersey, said 'destructive' refers to the storm's financial damages. Data shows that while Sandy may be the worst storm to ever batter New Jersey and the tristate region, it’s not the most destructive Atlantic storm in history.

Let’s start with some background.

Sandy slammed New Jersey on Oct. 29, leveling houses along the Shore and inland, and leaving millions without power for extended periods. The storm also unleashed a similar fury on New York and Connecticut.
  
We checked Atlantic storms in the National Hurricane Center’s data archives, which tracks storm costs through 2010. Hurricane Irene, which hit New Jersey in 2011, is not included.

Leading the list is 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, at $108 billion. Even though Katrina was largely a Gulf Coast storm, doing the most damage in Louisiana and Mississippi, it formed in the Atlantic and made landfall near Florida’s Miami-Dade/Broward county line. It then moved across south Florida into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, according to Hurricane Center data.

""Katrina is still a clear runaway number one"" in terms of damages, said Dennis Eltgen, a spokesman at the Miami-based Hurricane Center.

Second on the list is 1992’s Hurricane Andrew, at $26.5 billion in damages. Andrew devastated parts of south Florida, continued into the Gulf of Mexico and turned north, hitting Louisiana.

Those rankings change when damages are adjusted for 2010 dollars.

In that case, the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 that hit southeast Florida and Alabama ranks first, at $164.8 billion; Katrina second, at $113 billion; and Andrew fifth, at $58.5 billion.

Sandy, however, is different than many hurricanes that often swing through the Gulf of Mexico.

""I don’t think we were trying to claim that Sandy was more destructive than Katrina,"" O’Malley said. ""We were trying to say Sandy was the worst hurricane to fully hit the Eastern Seaboard. That being said, Katrina did obviously really hit New Orleans but clearly, it tailed over Florida. We were counting Katrina as only hitting the Gulf Coast. We trust the National Hurricane Center. If they say it’s both, we agree with that.""

The governors of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have estimated Sandy’s damages at $82 billion. President Obama has requested $60 billion in federal aid for the three states. The Senate approved the request and the House passed a $9 billion aid package Friday, and additional aid is expected to pass on Jan. 15.

In making the aid request for the White House, Jeffrey D. Zients, deputy director for Management for the Office of Management and Budget, described Sandy’s place in hurricane history in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).

""All told, although estimates of the total damage of Hurricane Sandy remain in flux, current projections are that Sandy is on track to be the second or third most costly natural disaster in U.S, history, behind Hurricane Katrina (2005) and close to Hurricane Andrew (1992),"" Zients wrote.

Our ruling

Environment New Jersey claimed that October’s Hurricane Sandy is ""the most destructive Atlantic storm, ever.""

Sandy may be the most destructive storm to hit a part of the Eastern Seaboard but in terms of most destructive Atlantic storms, that title goes to Katrina, which formed in the Atlantic and whose damages topped $100 billion, according to Hurricane Center data. Sandy, however, is very high on the list, with damages totaling at least  $82 billion. Still, that’s not number one in today’s dollars or compared with storms adjusted for inflation in 2010. We rate this statement Mostly False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

Facebook posting says the gun-rich Swiss have the lowest firearm crime rate in the civilized world
","
Gun control advocates say that fewer guns mean less gun crime. But a Dec. 16 posting on Facebook by a group calling itself the Conservatives Club argues exactly the opposite, and uses the example set by Switzerland to prove its point.

The portion of the post, titled ""A Little Gun History,"" that is in all capital letters caught our attention. It says, ""Switzerland issues every household a gun! Switzerland's government trains every adult they issue a rifle. Switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world!!! It's a no brainer! Don't let our government waste millions of our tax dollars in an effort to make all law abiding citizens an easy target.""

We thought the assertion that Switzerland ""has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world"" was worth checking out. (We’ll also give you some background about Switzerland's policy on issuing guns.)

(Coincidentally, on Jan. 2, 2013, while we were working on this item, gun policy in Switzerland made the news after a man who started shooting people on the street left three women dead and two men wounded in the Swiss village of Daillon.)

One source of information about guns is GunPolicy.Org, an evidence-based database on firearm safety hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health in Australia and partly co-funded, coincidentally, by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. We ran some comparisons through their database.

We're not going to get into the definition of what makes a ""civilized"" country; instead, we looked at GunPolicy.org’s data on gun homicide rates for 24 countries, mostly in western Europe but also Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.

Switzerland's gun homicide rate was anything but ""the lowest.""

It was fourth highest.

Only Greece, Ireland and the United States had higher rates.

(Switzerland also has the seventh highest suicide rate and the third highest rate of gun-related suicide, according to the GunPolicy.org data. In the latter case, only the United States and Finland had higher rates. Switzerland and Italy were tied for second for the rate of unintentional gun deaths; the United States was number one.)

""Guns kept at home are not necessarily dangerous in the streets, but mostly in situations that happen at home, such as suicide and murder of family members (especially females). In this respect, Switzerland has one of the highest proportions in the Western world,"" said Martin Killias, professor of criminology and criminal law at the University of Zurich Law School.

But homicide isn't the only type of gun crime, and the Facebook posting wasn't specific.

We wanted to know about all crimes involving a gun.

The problem is, ""different countries classify crimes totally differently, which makes it difficult to make a broad statement like that,"" said Philip Alpers, a gun policy researcher at the University of Sydney who runs GunPolicy.org and edits a firearm injury prevention news service.

He said the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is the best source because the organization classifies crimes in a consistent way. But that organization's website doesn't report data based on gun use, except when homicide is involved.

Nonetheless, we looked at its database on various crime categories such as assault, robbery, and theft, where guns were most likely to be involved, to see whether the crime rate in Switzerland was really that low.

It wasn't.

Eleven out of 26 countries had lower rates of theft than Switzerland.

Thirteen of 26 had lower rates of robbery.

Six of 26 had lower rates of assault.

So the Swiss can't boast the lowest crime rate, another claim gun advocates make.

How much of a role did guns play in such crimes?

The best database on that question was developed by the International Crime Victim Survey, begun in 1987 by a group of European criminologists in an attempt to compare crime rates in 31 countries and 32 major cities.

The ICVS was designed to standardize results and adjust for the fact that the legal definition of a crime can vary from country to country -- as can the willingness to report a crime. The data are based on surveys of victims. The most recent surveys were done in 2004 and 2005.

Once again, when you look at how often guns are used in the commission of a crime, Switzerland doesn't look like the safest place in Europe or other developed countries.

Instead of being at the top of the list among the safest of the 31 countries, Switzerland was tied for 12th when it came to the use of a firearm during a robbery. (The United States ranked 30th. Mexico was last.)

Switzerland was tied for 25th when it came to the risk of seeing a gun if you're the victim of an assault. (The United States was next to the bottom of the list by that measure as well.)

And while only 1 percent of the sexual offenses against women in Switzerland involved a gun, the rate was 0 percent in 22 other countries in the survey. (In the United States, the rate was 5 percent.)

In short, the claim about Switzerland seems completely made up.

One other point is particularly important here. The description of gun distribution in Switzerland omits important information.

The Swiss government doesn't hand out a gun to every household. It requires nearly every able-bodied young male adult to serve in the citizen militia, where they are issued a military rifle. The guns are supposed to be for military use only, not for personal defense.

Those men are supposed to show up for 18 weeks of training, followed by seven re-training sessions (each lasting three weeks) over the next 10 years.

If you want to keep your weapon after your years of service, it is refitted to scale back its firepower and you need to provide a reason for keeping it.

""It's very much like the militia ideal that was embodied in the Second Amendment,"" said Ladd Everett of the Washington, D.C.-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""Individuals who own military-style firearms are literally serving the national defense of their country.""

The ammunition for the weaponry is kept in a government arsenal. (Swiss men used to be able to keep up to 50 rounds at home and the government did a periodic inventory to make sure it wasn't being used, but that changed in 2007 when the country tightened its rules.)

Ammunition purchased at shooting ranges -- which are very popular in Switzerland -- is supposed to be used there.

Overall, ""they have fewer guns per capita than we do and far stricter gun laws in terms of private ownership,"" Everett said. ""If the U.S. ever attempted to implement gun laws like Switzerland's, the NRA would fight it tooth and nail.""

Our ruling

A Facebook posting, which has been shared more than 187,000 times, said, ""Switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world.""

But Killias, a Swiss researcher, told us, ""The way Switzerland is being depicted in some [accounts] is absurd.""

To say that the country has the lowest gun related crime rate is not true for homicide, according to the few studies of crime in various countries that includes data on gun use.

It's also not true that Switzerland has the lowest crime rate, whether or not guns are involved.

And survey data show that when a crime such as robbery or assault is committed, the likelihood of a gun being involved is lower in several countries than it is in Switzerland.

In short, this claim appears to be completely fabricated. We rate it Pants on Fire!

"['Oregon', 'Education', 'Sam Adams']","
Did the graduation rate in the Portland area jump by 5.5 percentage points last year?

","
With his term officially over, Sam Adams took some time to look back at his tenure as Portland mayor. In a newsletter, he recapped what he said were his biggest accomplishments -- from arts and transportation to economic development and education.

The education category caught our attention -- in part because the mayor has little control over the way public schools operate.

In the introduction to his term-in-review, Adams said the city is now on track to greatly increase the graduation rate in high schools over the next few years, thanks to a trend that began while he was in office.

""Last year,"" he wrote, ""the graduation rate for our combined six-district footprint jumped 5.5 percent (from 56.8 percent to 62.3 percent).""

We wondered whether he had that last bit right.

Portland City Hall reporter Brad Schmidt forwarded us correspondence with Adams’ former spokeswoman Caryn Brooks, who noted that their source was All Hands Raised, an education nonprofit.

All Hands Raised analyzed data from the Oregon Department of Education and found that the percentage of students graduating on time rose to 62.3 percent in the most recent data from 56.8 percent the year before -- an increase of 5.5 percentage points.

(Now, wonks among us will note that the actual percentage increase is roughly 9.7 and that Adams should have said percentage points. But we’re going to let that go because he included both years’ graduation rates. It’s clear what he meant.)

The numbers aren’t wrong -- but there’s a big caveat: The 5.5 point increase may not be as robust as it appears.

Last January, Portland Public Schools announced a 5 percentage point increase in its graduation rate from the 2009-10 school year to the 2010-11 school year. It was an eye-popping improvement for any district, but especially for Portland, which has one of the lowest rates in the state.

The problem, though, as The Oregonian’s education reporter Betsy Hammond discovered, was that ""most of the gain is due to deeper digging through old records, not new techniques teachers and counselors used with students.""

The district, it turned out, had not been closely tracking students that transferred and had been counting them as dropouts. After the class of 2011 graduated, Hammond reported, the district's manager of state reporting ""asked principals to dig through paper files to check whether students whose electronic records indicated they were dropouts in fact had transferred away.""

The principals found that was the case for hundreds of students and documented the transfers. That raised the 2011 graduation rate substantially and gave an artificially rosy picture of the district's year-over-year improvement. Hammond calculated that ""better handling of paperwork accounted for 3 percentage points of that 5-point gain.""



In May 2012, Portland Public went back and dug deeper into both the 2011 and 2010 graduation data. The state was convinced by the district's new evidence and revised upward Portland's graduation rate for both years. Those higher figures are the ones All Hands Raised used in their analysis. However, the size of the year-to-year increase is likely inflated because it was easier to track down accurate information about the 2011 graduates than the 2010 graduates. Basically, it's hard to say how much of the increase is better paperwork and how much is genuine improvement in graduating students.

We spoke with Nate Waas Shull at All Hands Raised and asked him if his organization knew how much of the area-wide increase was due to the improved paperwork. ""There's no way to know,"" he said. ""That would be a pretty complex study.""

Still, he said, it certainly had something to do with the recent improvement. ""My sense is that, across the board, every district has become motivated to really know, to no longer let kids disappear. Districts are tracking students down.""

We called and emailed Adams’ temporary spokeswoman for comment but never heard back.
We did get Amy Ruiz, Adams’ chief of staff, on the phone. She said simply that improving graduation rates takes time.

In reviewing his tenure as Portland mayor, Sam Adams said that the city was well on its way to improving graduation rates. Last year alone, he said, ""the graduation rate for our combined six-district footprint jumped 5.5% (from 56.8% to 62.3%).""

We checked Adam’s figure and found that it relied on graduation statistics that benefited from, at least in part, better record keeping and not just better student retention. Waas Shull at All Hands Raised said as much. That’s an important detail.
