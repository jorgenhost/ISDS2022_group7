Comedy Central's Jon Stewart: Congress' shock at spying on allies rings hollow
","The U.S. tapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone, along with the phone calls of other American allies, has led members of Congress to call foul. Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show, isn’t having any of it. ""They have no right to be surprised,"" Stewart said. Stewart then walked through all the ways that from 2001 onward, lawmakers have given the green light for greater and more expansive eavesdropping. ""Congress passed the Patriot Act giving our intelligence agencies access to, quote, 'any tangible thing',"" Stewart said. ""Our intelligence has to have access to everything except wishes and fairies."" Sarcasm aside, Stewart made some specific allegations. ""The very Legislature that is bewildered at the scope and reach of our spying apparatus, granted them the scope and reach,"" he said. ""In 2008 and 2012 (they) explicitly rejected an amendment calling for more disclosure of said surveillance."" While many of Stewart’s bits are pure comedy, his take on Congress’ actions includes specific claims that can be fact-checked. In that vein, Stewart is correct. Congress expanded the legal boundaries of intelligence gathering and turned back several efforts aimed to reveal details of how spying touched the lives of ordinary Americans. The only caveat: It seems unlikely that any of the amendments he referenced would have led the intelligence agencies to report on their spying on America’s allies. Bolstering FISA in 2008 and 2012 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, has been around since 1978. It basically sets the ground rules for spying on foreign agents, especially when that spying touches American soil and might touch American citizens. It gives a special court the power to oversee that work. After the terrorist attacks of 2001, President George W. Bush pressed to give intelligence agencies additional money and authority to look at information that people might have thought was private, such as library records. That was the ""any tangible thing"" that Stewart referred to. But library records were a tiny sliver of the data collection program created by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Electronic information, over the Internet and through telephone networks was gathered and stored in vast quantities. The collection of that data became known in 2006, when the role of major companies such as Verizon and AT&T was revealed. That prompted a 2008 review of the FISA law, to basically retroactively approve the arrangement. ""The 2008 amendments appear to be designed to legalize warrantless wiretapping by the NSA that had been done illegally prior to the amendment,"" said Molly Bishop Shadel, an expert in foreign intelligence law at the University of Virginia School of Law. ""Congress expanded the scope of FISA even though it knew or should have known that the NSA had done something questionable."" During the debate in 2008 the main point of contention was whether to grant retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies that apparently had given the government access to data that passed through their networks. While the changes in 2008 did set some limits on domestic surveillance, they gave intelligence agencies greater flexibility to use new technology to track the activities of foreign agents so long as they were outside American borders, even if their communications ran through American systems. The 2008 revisions were to last five years, which prompted further tinkering in 2012. By 2012, several members of Congress offered amendments that would have compelled intelligence agencies to give Congress more details on their activities. One from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., would have urged the government to share key interpretations of law from the FISA court. Another from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would have told the government to report the number of Americans whose personal records had been caught up in its surveillance nets and would have strengthened the rules against warrantless searches. A third from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., would have required a warrant for access to any U.S. communication, although it didn’t speak directly to greater disclosure to Congress. The Senate rejected all three amendments. Wyden’s bill came the closest but failed 52-43. The overall reauthorization of the wiretapping program passed 73 to 23. The expanded reach of intelligence agencies continued and any amendment that Stewart referred to was turned back. (We reached out to The Daily Show for supporting details but did not hear back.) Congress ""definitely had a chance to pass amendments that would have given them more information,"" said Trevor Timm, a privacy activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. But there is a caveat. Timm said none of the amendments would have changed American activities overseas. They all were aimed at protecting the privacy of Americans. While keeping the country safe from its enemies remains the larger goal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, there is nothing in the law that puts America’s friends off limits. Legally, the U.S Code says intelligence agencies ""shall keep the congressional intelligence committees fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities."" But that law allows to the director of national intelligence to set the standards as to what should be included in its reports. Our ruling Stewart said Congress had given intelligence agencies broad powers to engage in surveillance and had rejected an amendment that would have required more disclosure. Overall, changes made in 2008 and continued in 2012 did give U.S. spy agencies more leeway. Individual lawmakers offered amendments aimed expressly at giving Congress more details on intelligence activities, but they failed to win enough support. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096896F80>],/factchecks/2013/nov/05/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-congresss-shock-spying-allies-rings-ho/

Senate candidate’s use of ‘only’ hits a snag
","The candidate field for retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ seat is more crowded than the mall on Christmas Eve. Thus far, the race includes three congressmen, a former secretary of state, a former state senator, a former U.S. senator’s daughter and a former governor’s cousin. And that’s just the candidates who’ve grabbed the most headlines. For lesser-known candidates, distinguishing themselves has been tough. One candidate, Dr. Branko Radulovacki, a Democrat and Atlanta psychiatrist, is doing his best to emerge from the fray. Dr. Rad -- as he prefers to be called -- has been appearing everywhere, commenting on the issues in online videos, town hall meetings and through campaign emails. One such email, titled ""Walking the Talk,"" highlights Dr. Rad’s actions. The email includes several ""only"" statements, touting the Atlanta doctor as being the only candidate to participate in the 50th anniversary March on Washington, the ""Si se puede"" immigration reform march in Atlanta and to march in Atlanta’s Pride parade. But it was his ""only"" statements about two controversial political topics -- Syria and the Affordable Care Act -- that intrigued us. Here are the key statements from Dr. Rad’s campaign email, emphasis his: ""I’m the only one who spoke out against bombing Syria. And the only one who took on Governor Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens over their efforts to ‘obstruct’ the Affordable Care Act in Georgia."" With more than a dozen announced candidates in that U.S. Senate race, we were curious whether Dr. Rad’s statements were correct. Did he actually hold the ""only"" title on these two issues? We decided to investigate. A few months ago, international relations were strained as President Barack Obama considered taking military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Dr. Rad released a statement opposing the strikes. And at the time, many of Georgia’s leading Republicans, including those running for Senate, also denounced Obama’s plans, saying the president failed to make his case for attacking the country. PolitiFact Georgia’s research found that Peach State congressmen and Senate candidates Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey spoke out against the proposed attacks, and U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston was leaning no. And former Secretary of State Karen Handel even made a radio ad out of her opposition, and used it as an attack ad against leading Democratic challenger Michelle Nunn. On the Democratic side, former state Sen. Steen Miles also publicly opposed strikes on Syria. From our research of major announced candidates, only Nunn supported Obama’s plans. There was less political chatter surrounding Dr. Rad’s Affordable Care Act claim. Georgia  Gov. Nathan Deal and Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens were early opponents of Obama’s health care plan. Hudgens even bragged during the summer about being an ""obstructionist"" to the law. Last week, when asked about the health care plan rollout, Hudgens said he hopes the plan ""implodes."" Georgia chose not to expand Medicaid for low-income residents, and not to offer a state-based health care marketplace for its residents seeking health insurance coverage under the new law. Dr. Rad released a statement and video about the leaders’ ""obstructionism,"" saying it was hurting the state. ""We call on Gov. Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens to STEP UP and lead, or STEP ASIDE,"" Rad’s statement and petition said. Last week, he applauded Hudgens for putting some helpful information about the law and insurance marketplaces on the insurance commissioner’s website. Along with Dr. Rad’s statements, we found comments from Nunn about Deal’s rejection of the Medicaid expansion and the impact on war veterans. (Nunn received a True rating from PolitiFact Georgia for her statements.) When contacted by PolitiFact Georgia, Dr. Rad reviewed the statements and admitted that his campaign email was incorrect. The doctor said that a campaign staffer in charge of composing the email unintentionally misrepresented one of Dr. Rad’s Facebook posts. That post, an open letter dated Oct. 11, detailed the ways the physician was different from the other Senate candidates. ""The buck stops with me,"" Dr. Rad told us. ""It was a mistake and I take full responsibility for that mistake. I will set the record straight."" Dr. Rad promised to send out another campaign statement correcting the errors. So where does this leave us? The Atlanta physician released a campaign email that said he was the only Senate candidate to speak out against bombing Syria, and to challenge Georgia’s governor and insurance commissioner about obstructing the federal health care law. Dr. Rad is incorrect on the first point: Several Republican candidates, including current congressmen, spoke against proposed attacks on Syria. And another candidate produced a radio ad about her opposition. On the health care front, one other Democratic Senate candidate spoke out against the state’s decision not to expand Medicaid to poor residents, which was a large part of the Affordable Care Act. Dr. Rad admitted that the campaign email was incorrect and promised to correct the error. Corrections are always a good thing. But on the initial claim, the doctor gets a False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097281780>],/factchecks/2013/nov/05/branko-radulovacki/senate-candidates-use-only-hits-snag/

Charlie Crist says Rick Scott skipped out on education summit but spoke to tea party activists in same week
","One of the most applause-grabbing lines Charlie Crist deployed in the rally announcing his candidacy for governor on Nov. 4, 2013, honed in on just one week in the life of his Republican rival. ""(Rick Scott is) a governor who cares so little about education that he didn’t even come to his own education summit,"" Crist said. ""But he did take time to go to the tea party convention the same week."" The crowd of Democrats in St. Petersburg loved the line. But we wanted to know if it was accurate. Scott announced a three-day ""education accountability summit"" on Aug. 22. The event capped a heated summer for education in Florida, with the Board of Education deciding to pad school grades, opposition mounting against Common Core standards from across the political spectrum, and Education Commissioner Tony Bennett resigning amid accusations he helped shield a charter school led by a Republican donor from getting a ""C"" back in Indiana. It was time to talk it out -- or to at least talk about something else. Scott asked then-interim Education Commissioner Pam Stewart to convene the summit at St. Petersburg College in Clearwater Aug. 26-28. ""Florida's education accountability system has become a national model, but we are at a critical point in our history,"" Scott said in a statement before the meeting. Invitations went to three-dozen people with stakes in education, including three county teachers of the year, eight legislators, activists from Florida PTA and Florida Parents Against Common Core, Board of Education chairman Gary Chartrand, Florida Education Association president Andy Ford, Miami-Dade superintendent Alberto Carvalho, and Patricia Levesque, executive director of former Gov. Jeb Bush’s Foundation for Florida’s Future.   On the agenda: new Common Core standards, new tests that will come in place of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, school grades and teacher evaluations. And yes, Scott was a no-show. His press office said that was intentional. ""Gov. Scott wanted the benefit of an honest discussion on school grades, state standards, standard assessments and teacher evaluations,"" Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said at the time. ""The focus of the summit was to ensure that each Florida child is prepared to succeed."" Scott did send representatives, including Stewart, communications director Melissa Sellers, policy chief Chris Finkbeiner and members of his education policy team, deputy communications director Frank Collins told us. So what was Scott up to that week? We compiled his activities based on his public schedule on the governor’s website and news stories. (We asked for a more complete account of his activities from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement but did not get it by our deadline.) Monday, Aug. 26: Scott’s schedule included a meeting with Gray Swoope, CEO of Enterprise Florida, and time in his Capitol office. Meanwhile, the summit’s first day was mostly spent on introductions and background presentations, according to the Tampa Bay Times.  Tuesday, Aug. 27: Another day in Tallahassee. Scott’s schedule contained several hours of ""staff and call time,"" a meeting with agency heads, and a dinner with community leaders at the governor’s mansion.   Wednesday, Aug. 28: Scott met with Republican speaker-designate Steve Crisafulli in Cocoa, Fla. In Fort Myers, he pledged millions for a project aiming to improve natural water flow to part of the Everglades and limit water releases from Lake Okeechobee. Later, he marked the opening of the new headquarters for Univision and its new English-language network Fusion in Doral. The summit wrapped early without him in Clearwater, with attendees calling for reforms to school grades and teacher evaluations. Thursday, Aug. 29: The morning after the summit ended, Scott had a jobs announcement with Boeing in Virginia Gardens. What he did that night caused a stir: He met with state Sen. John Thrasher, Chartrand of the Board of Education and former Gov. Bush at an undisclosed location in Miami at suppertime. The news of his behind-the-scenes meeting with education power players irked parent activists, according to the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald. ""This is how education reform gets done in Florida,"" Rita Solnet, founder of the advocacy group Parents Across America, told the Times/Herald. ""The summit was a façade. The real decisions have always been made by Jeb Bush."" Friday, Aug. 30: At a luxury hotel in Orlando, Scott spoke before a crowd of conservative activists with tea party leanings for 15 minutes at the two-day Americans for Prosperity Foundation ""Defending the Dream"" summit, about the state’s economic turnaround (and took too much credit for an expected tax revenue record, we determined). Americans for Prosperity is a conservative political action committee founded by libertarian billionaires David and Charles Koch and widely seen as sharing the concerns of and organizing the grassroots tea party movement. Americans for Prosperity Foundation, which sponsored the event, is its less political brother, a 501(c)(3) that focuses on education. Both groups believe in free markets, low taxes and limited government. Our ruling Scott delegated oversight of the education summit to his education commissioner, and other members of his team also attended. Still, Crist is right on the facts: Scott steered clear of one summit that week and made a speech at another laced with politics and connections to the tea party movement.

"['National', 'History', 'Foreign Policy', 'Mike  Rogers']","
Rep. Mike Rogers says U.S. shuttering of intelligence operation in 1929 led to World War II
","The debate over the federal government’s surveillance policies -- prompted by the release of National Security Agency documents taken by leaker Edward Snowden -- has revived interest in a decades-old tale of spycraft. The story of the ""American Black Chamber"" intelligence program came up during an interview with House Intelligence chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., on the Nov. 3, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. Amid a discussion of whether the United States had been wrong to spy on friendly foreign leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Rogers stood up for an aggressive American intelligence effort overseas. ""We did this in the 1930s,"" Rogers said. ""We turned it off. In 1929, the Secretary of State at that time, (when) they were collecting information to protect America, said, ‘You know, we shouldn't do this. This is unseemly.’ They turned it off. Well, that led to a whole bunch of misunderstanding that led to World War II, that killed millions and millions of people."" We had two questions about Rogers’ claim. First, was he accurate in describing the history of this early United States intelligence effort? And second, is it reasonable to argue that the elimination of such a program led to ""millions and millions"" of deaths in World War II? The ""American Black Chamber"" This part of the story begins with Herbert O. Yardley (1889-1958), an Indiana native who became a code clerk with the State Department and later served during World War I in the cryptologic section of military intelligence. He parlayed that experience into what is generally considered the United States’ first peacetime code-breaking operation -- a joint project of the Army and the State Department. Using a shell company office in Manhattan, cryptoanalysts toiled behind a locked door, breaking foreign codes used in telegrams. During its dozen years of operation, the office cracked the codes of 45,000 telegrams, including messages sent by at least 19 nations, both allies (England and France) and rivals (Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union), according to David Kahn’s landmark 1996 history, The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet. In 1921 and 1922, the office figured out the codes used by Japanese negotiators at an international naval conference in Washington, providing internal Japanese bargaining positions to chief negotiator Charles Evans Hughes. Their work made it possible for the United States to secure an advantageous outcome. But by the late 1920s, the project began to fall out of favor. Congress was reluctant to provide more funding, while telegraph company executives were increasingly uncomfortable diverting telegrams.  (This part of the story offers an eerie parallel to the unease expressed by Google and other companies to customer data traffic being surveilled by the NSA.) For Yardley, a new source of turbulence emerged when Herbert Hoover became president in 1929. Listening to Hoover’s first speech as president from a speakeasy, Yardley could sense that the administration’s goal of following high ethical standards would pose a serious challenge to his office. He was right. In a bid to pre-empt any change to his program, Yardley waited until Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson had been in office for a few months -- banking that Stimson had ""lost some of his innocence is wrestling with the hardheaded realities of diplomacy,"" as Kahn put it -- and then presented him with some important code-breaking results. The tactic had worked with previous Cabinet officials, but this time, it backfired. Stimson, Kahn writes, ""was shocked to learn of the existence of the Black Chamber, and totally disapproved of it. He regarded it as a low, snooping activity, a sneaking, spying, keyhole-peering kind of dirty business, a violation of the principle of mutual trust upon which he conducted both his personal affairs and his foreign policy. ... Stimson rejected the view that such means justified even patriotic ends (and) said later, 'Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.' In an act of pure moral courage, Stimson, affirming principle over expediency, withdrew all State Department funds, (and) since these constituted its major income, their loss shuttered the office."" We interviewed several scholars of intelligence and all agreed that on the basic facts of the Black Chamber, Rogers was essentially right -- the who (the Secretary of State), the when (1929) and the why (that such surveillance was ungentlemanly). The only objection we heard is that while the Hoover administration shut down the Black Chamber, it did not shut down all such intelligence activities. The Army Signal Corps, under the leadership of William Friedman, continued to produce intelligence. Before we move on to the second part of Rogers’ quote, we’ll provide a brief postscript about the key players. Yardley was initially ostracized when his shop closed down, never working again for the U.S. government (though he consulted with such foreign countries as Canada and China). He did, however, get a revenge of sorts by publishing a book, The American Black Chamber, that became a financial and critical success. To this day, it remains a classic of the cryptologic literary genre. Meanwhile, the highly ethical Hoover administration proceeded to ""lie straightforwardly"" (Kahn’s words) by denying, in no uncertain terms, the existence of the Black Chamber, even when confronted with Yardley’s book. And Stimson? As peacetime morphed into World War II, he changed his tune. As President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of War, Stimson received intelligence from MAGIC, a highly classified codebreaking effort run by divisions of the Army and Navy. Did the shuttering of the Black Chamber lead the United States to World War II While Rogers’ description of the Black Chamber is generally accurate, our experts said, his suggestion that its absence led to World War II is, at the very least, greatly exaggerated. Richard Breitman, an American University scholar of the World War II era, acknowledged that the closure of Yardley’s office ""undoubtedly hindered American intelligence collection during the 1930s,"" but he added that ""connecting this with the outbreak of World War II, which began in Europe without U.S. participation, is way off."" Breitman noted that ""there was plenty of public information, including Hitler's Mein Kampf, about Nazi Germany's general inclination to go to war,"" he said. In addition, ""various western diplomats reported specific details from Berlin and elsewhere about Nazi plans. But Congress had limited the Roosevelt Administration's capacity to react with the Neutrality Acts."" Joseph Wippl, a professor of the practice of international relations at Boston University, also points to the broader push in the United States toward neutrality, arguing that the disbanding of the Black Chamber was a symptom of a more general disengagement the nation was undergoing at the time. ""After World War I, the United States returned to a policy of isolationism, in spite of the fact we were the world's dominant power,"" he said. ""The fact that we did not have military or intelligence capability before World War II reflects what happened to the United States after World War I -- that is, back to isolationism."" John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that after spending ""nearly half a century studying World War II, only in recent years have I come to think I have some understanding of the thing. To me, (Rogers’) is a novel proposition. There were certainly many intelligence failures in the years before the war, but they were mainly failures of imagination, not collection."" Our ruling Rogers said that in 1929, the Secretary of State shut down a program that was ""collecting information to protect America"" because it was ""unseemly,"" but that move led to ""millions and millions"" of deaths in World War II. He is generally correct in his description of that year’s shuttering of a pioneering codebreaking project called the Black Chamber, but historians dismiss any suggestion that the program led inexorably to the onset of World War II. At best, they say, that notion is greatly exaggerated. We rate Rogers’ statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097701740>],/factchecks/2013/nov/04/mike-rogers/rep-mike-rogers-says-us-shuttering-intelligence-op/

Rush Limbaugh's errant attack on grandfathered union health plans
","President Barack Obama made sure his union pals got special treatment in the health care law, says conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. How? Their health insurance plans are locked in, completely immune to new rules set forth by the Affordable Care Act, he said, noting that everyday Americans being hit with cancellation notices from their insurers don’t get the same courtesy. ""If your plan is the result of collective bargaining, no subsequent changes by anybody -- insurance companies, Obamacare -- can force your grandfathered policy to change,"" Limbaugh said about the union carve-out on his show Oct. 30. ""So, in other words, union insurers can amend their coverage. Your insurance company can't,"" Limbaugh continued. ""Well, your insurance company can, but you lose your grandfathered status when they do. Unions don't because they're covered under an amendment made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement."" Limbaugh’s commentary leans on a Human Events column by Betsy McCaughey, the former New York lieutenant governor who once claimed that ""Obamacare will question your sex life."" We contacted several experts of the health care law, as well as unions, and they agreed: The law does contain a special rule for some union-negotiated health plans, but it’s not a permanent guarantee of grandfather status. It was a temporary rule aimed to create a smooth transition to the new law without breaking collectively bargained contracts across the country. You may be wondering about all this ""grandfather"" talk in the news lately, and why people are so dad-gum angry about it. We’ll back up a little bit. We discussed grandfathered plans, the fight du jour in the ongoing health care wars, at length in this fact-check. Basically, a health plan purchased by an individual or through an employer may be ""grandfathered"" if it existed before the Affordable Care Act became law March 23, 2010, and has not significantly changed since. The insurers offering these old plans have to follow some parts of the new law, such as covering adult children up to age 26, but they can largely keep these plans as they are without making many of the bigger changes required of new plans, such as fully covering preventive care. That said, the plan can lose its grandfathered status if the insurer makes a tweak that is considered too drastic by the federal government. For example, a plan can lose its grandfathered status if copayments go up by at least $5 plus medical inflation or if an employer decreases its contribution rate by more than five percentage points for a group plan. There’s a lot of fine print, and you can read it all courtesy of the breezy Federal Register. A plan that loses its grandfathered status is headed for certain death. There’s your need-to-know background info. So where do unions come in already? Here’s where: The same section of the Affordable Care Act that talks about grandfathered policies also talks about plans agreed to through collective bargaining (section 1251 (d) on page 56). The lawmakers who wrote this provision were not thinking of those of us without law degrees when they wrote it, so here’s the PunditFact translation: Workers whose health benefits are provided through an insurance company and were included in a collective bargaining agreement ratified before March 23, 2010, can keep their plan no matter the changes -- but not for long. The plan is only automatically grandfathered until the termination date of the agreement. So they do receive different treatment, but only until the agreement expires. After that, the plan must meet the same requirements of all other grandfathered plans. And importantly, none of this applies to collectively bargained plans for self-insured employers, which comprise more than half of union plans. Union-negotiated self-insured plans operate like all other companies. ""This isn’t some huge gift which is being handed to the union,"" said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University law professor. ""It’s simply recognizing that if you have coverage under a collective bargaining agreement, as long as that collective bargaining agreement remains in place, that coverage is okay."" Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, sounded a similar chord, saying ""to me, that’s not unreasonable"" because the alternative is prying open existing agreements to satisfy the health care law. A union plan could keep its grandfathered status after the expiration date of the agreement as long as ""no changes were made since March 23, 2010, that would have otherwise caused the plan to lose its grandfathered status,"" according to the University of California Berkeley Labor Center. In other words, union plans could lose their grandfathered status once the agreement expires if they reduce benefits in ways that are at odds with the health care law, just like all other grandfathered plans, said Randy G. DeFrehn, National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans executive director. ""The statement that collectively bargained plans cannot lose their grandfather status is not correct,"" he said. Experts told us most union agreements last between three to five years, which means most of those plans are already being treated like other grandfathered plans because the agreements that were in place before the health care law passed have expired. ""It’s a really narrow exception,"" said Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University School of Law. ""This is kind of coming to an end anyway."" The law says these plans can be adjusted to comply with the Affordable Care Act without breaking the union agreement. Our ruling Limbaugh takes a point about real language inserted in the health care law for some union-negotiated health care plans and twists the truth. These plans are only grandfathered for as long as the collective bargaining agreement lasts. After the agreement expires, and some already have, those plans are held to the same standards as all other grandfathered plans. Limbaugh's suggestion that ""no subsequent changes by anybody"" can change the union plans goes too far. On top of that, union-negotiated self-insured plans (which make up more than half of all union plans) are treated no differently than regular employer plans. We rate Limbaugh's claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC4840>],/factchecks/2013/nov/04/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaughs-errant-attack-unions-grandfathered-/

Barack Obama says Arkansas 'has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured already' due to Obamacare
","Given the troubled launch of the national health insurance marketplace at healthcare.gov, President Barack Obama has been forced to trumpet good news about his signature health care law wherever it can be found. During a speech on the new law in Boston on Oct. 30, 2013, Obama pointed to examples of states that had succeeded in signing up lots of new enrollees. Hearing one of these states Obama cited -- Arkansas -- struck us as notable, because it has become a solidly red state. In addition, a reader from Arkansas emailed us to see if we could check it out. In the speech, Obama said that Arkansas, a state he didn’t win in 2008 or 2012, ""has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured already."" The White House later reiterated this claim in a tweet. Is it true that Arkansas has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured residents? The state’s Republican Legislature wasn’t inclined to expand Medicaid to adults and families with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level -- as provided for under Obamacare -- but the Democratic governor, Mike Beebe, proposed an alternative. He proposed using the federal payments the law was offering to Arkansas to expand Medicaid and instead give it to qualified Arkansas residents, who would then use it to purchase private insurance plans on the new marketplace. In September, as the Oct. 1 startup date for the new marketplace was approaching, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services gave Arkansas the green light to pursue this effort. It’s been dubbed ""the private option."" The state sent out notices to potentially eligible residents. Once a recipient of one of these notices returns an application to accept the ""private option,"" the department will check their income eligibility and, if they qualify, will direct them the Insure Ark website to select their plan. (The state does steer a small fraction of those newly eligible -- those with medical issues that can be better treated under Medicaid -- to traditional Medicaid instead.) Even if someone who’s eligible doesn’t select a plan, that person will be automatically assigned a plan by the state. After the person is informed about this automatically assigned plan, they will still have a chance to choose another one if they wish. While the new insurance is set to kick in on Jan. 1, the state considers residents to have completed the coverage process as soon as the department approves their application and directs them to Insure Ark. This mirrors the situation with people who secure coverage from the national healthcare.gov site -- they are considered ""signed up"" even if their coverage officially starts Jan. 1. When we checked with the Arkansas Department of Human Services, spokeswoman Amy Webb said that through Oct. 26, the state had received 70,595 applications from potentially eligible residents, which probably undercounts the actual number received four days later, when Obama gave his speech. (This figure does not include anyone who’s signed up for the federal plan on healthcare.gov.) Of the 70,595 applicants, Webb said, 65,138 have already been determined eligible. The remaining 5,457 have applications pending and will be processed soon, she said. Webb added that the state has been using the ballpark figure of 500,000 for the number of uninsured residents. Using that figure, 13 percent of uninsured Arkansans have secured insurance through Obamacare. Especially if you account for the extra couple of days’ worth of applications not counted in this figure, this qualifies as the ""almost 14 percent"" Obama cited. However, to the extent that Obama was using the Arkansas case as an example of how the law was working well, it’s important to note the limitations of his example for a national audience. Residents who are eligible for Arkansas’ private option via Insure Ark only account for a fraction of the state’s uninsured population, perhaps 40 percent. A majority of the uninsured in Arkansas earn too much to qualify for the private option and must instead use a different, and for now, less functional, website -- the national healthcare.gov site. In other words, while the success of Arkansas’ private option is real, using it as an example in a national speech glosses over the fact that the state's uninsured population that doesn't qualify for Medicaid is going to have to use the troubled national website. Our ruling Obama said that due to the health care law, Arkansas ""has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured already."" That number is very close, if not spot on. But it's a case study that has limited application for the rest of the country, because of the state's unique approach to Medicaid. Many of the state's uninsured still have to get coverage from the troubled healthcare.gov website. The statement is accurate but needs additional information or context, so we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2B5E00>],/factchecks/2013/nov/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-arkansas-has-covered-almost-14-p/

FNC's Dana Perino says the health insurance industry is run mostly by Democrats
","Fans of the Fox News Channel program The Five are probably familiar with the show’s format. A group of political pundits gathers around a table weekdays at 5 p.m. and shouts back and forth on the topics of the day. Most are professional pundits, though co-host Dana Perino did serve as press secretary for George W. Bush. And many times, the panel offers some harsh criticism for President Barack Obama. On its Halloween episode, co-host Greg Gutfeld broadsided Obama’s health care law and the administration’s sales job. Holding a demon puppet he called Seth, Gutfeld said that if Democrats had ""to sell a razor blade"" they’d ""put it in an apple."" ""They got to hide the ugliness of their beliefs,"" Gutfeld said. The comment drew a response from liberal co-host Bob Beckel, who made an effort to defend the law and countered that his conservative colleagues were schilling for the insurance industry. ""The insurance industry is actually run by mostly Democrats and gave President Obama a lot of …"" Perino jumped in. Before she could finish, Beckel groaned, ""Buuulllll …."" before trailing off himself. ""That is true, Bob, and the associations prove it,"" countered Perino. Beckel, who wears trademark suspenders, was later seen resting his arms on a pumpkin that had ""single payer"" written on it in marker. As fact-checkers, we’ll weigh in on Perino’s point, that the insurance industry is ""run by mostly Democrats."" We reached out to Perino but didn’t hear back. Of course, there is no simple way to determine the political affiliation of the entire health insurance industry. We started by checking Perino’s suggestion that health insurance associations prove her claim to be right. The two largest that we could identify are America's Health Insurance Plans and the National Association of Health Underwriters. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tallies political contributions, America’s Health Insurance Plans political action committee has contributed about $396,000 to Democrats since 2008 compared to $436,000 to Republicans over the same period of time. The CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, Karen Ignagni, has donated to both Republicans and Democrats over the years -- including Eric Cantor and Josh Mandel on the Republican side and Henry Waxman and Charles Schumer among the Democrats. Ignagni has led health industry groups since 1993 and worked for the AFL-CIO before that. We wouldn’t conclude that means the industry is mostly run by Democrats. (We wouldn’t conclude that the industry is run mostly by Republicans, either.) The National Association of Health Underwriters PAC, meanwhile, has contributed $1.74 million to Republicans since 2008 and $494,000 to Democrats. (We found no political contributions from CEO Janet Trautwein.) Overall, the Center for Responsive Politics says that the insurance industry has contributed $94 million to Republicans since 2008 and $62 million to Democrats. (This particular comparison is only modestly helpful, however, as it includes companies that also provide property, life and car insurance.) Another way to consider Perino’s claim is to look at the men and women running the largest health insurance companies in the United States. Here is a list of some of those companies, the number of people they say they serve, and what we know about the political leanings of the chief executives: UnitedHealthcare (70 million people served): The company’s PAC, United For Health, reported that 58 percent of its 2012 federal contributions went to Republicans, while 42 percent went to Democrats. Since 2008, the group has given slightly more to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- $721,000 to Democrats and $704,000 to Republicans. CEO Stephen Hemsley has donated almost solely to Republicans since 2010, including $10,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and $5,000 to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Aetna (50 million people served): Aetna’s political action committee reported that it donated $285,500 to Republican candidates in 2012, compared with $170,000 to Democrats. It contributed more money to Republican candidates in 2010 and 2008 as well. CEO Mark T. Bertolini has donated to both Republicans and Democrats, including Republican U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, Rob Portman, Kelly Ayotte and Roy Blunt, and Democrats Ron Wyden and Max Baucus. WellPoint (36 million people served): The company’s political action committee, WellPAC, contributed about $1.5 million to Republican candidates since 2008 and about half as much to Democrats. Joseph R. Swedish, who was named CEO in March, has only made one contribution to a federal candidate since 2010, $500 to Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Humana (20 million people served): Humana’s political action committee has contributed more to Republicans in every political cycle since 2000. Humana CEO Bruce  D. Broussard mainly has contributed only to Humana’s PAC. The Center for Public Integrity reported that from January 2007 through August 2012 ""the political action committees of the 11 largest health insurance companies and their primary trade group gave $10.2 million to federal politicians with nearly two-thirds of the total going to Republicans who oppose the law or support its repeal."" In the case of America’s largest health insurers, there is little evidence to suggest they are run mostly by Democrats based on their political giving. Our ruling Perino claimed that the health insurance industry is run mostly by Democrats. We could find almost nothing to suggest that’s the case. The way most large businesses and industries show their political stripes, through campaign contributions, suggests that large health insurers and their trade associations are more likely to support Republicans. Or at the least, that they hedge their bets by supporting both sides. We rate Perino’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2B5780>],/factchecks/2013/nov/04/dana-perino/fncs-dana-perino-says-health-insurance-industry-ru/
"['Jobs', 'Workers', 'PunditFact', 'Bill Maher']","
Bill Maher: Average fast food worker is 29, most are on public assistance
","HBO host and comedian Bill Maher recently blasted conservatives who oppose increasing the minimum wage, pointing to a new study that says the median income for fast food jobs is $8.69 an hour. That’s ""barely enough to gas up the car you’re living in,"" he said, a quip met with ooo’s from the studio audience. He closed Real Time with Bill Maher on Oct. 25, 2013, with more factoids about the plight of workers employed in fast-food restaurants. ""Consider the fact that most fast food workers, whose average age by the way now is 29, I'm not talking about kids, are on some form of public assistance, which is not surprising,"" Maher said. ""When even working people can’t make enough to live, they take money from the government in the form of food stamps, school lunches, housing assistance, day care."" Maher’s point being that by opposing an increase to the minimum wage, Republicans are forcing fast food workers to need some type of public assistance -- something Republicans also oppose. We won’t comment on the policy, but we did wonder about two specific factual claims: that the average fast-food worker is 29 and receives public aid. On the age point, 2012 Current Population Survey data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show the median age of front-line (the people who take orders or cook food) workers, including those at fast-food restaurants and excluding managers, is 29.2. A BLS spokesman said this would be the most reliable category to use. Maher’s researcher pointed to a 2012 Atlantic story that said the median age for these workers is more than 28, citing the BLS. (While Maher said average age and not median age, the median, or midpoint of a dataset, is actually a better representation of fast food workers as a whole, experts told us.) As for the claim about public assistance, that comes from the study Maher referenced on air. Released Oct. 15, it grabbed headlines with its bold conclusion: ""More than half (52 percent) of the families of frontline fast food workers are enrolled in one or more public programs, compared to 25 percent of the workforce as a whole."" The study was done by a team of six researchers from the University of California-Berkeley Labor Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Department of Urban and Regional Planning, and University of Massachusetts-boston Labor Resource Center. It was funded by a group that supports raising the minimum wage, Fast Food Forward. The report argues that low wages lead to frontline fast food workers seeking public benefits, in addition to a lack of health insurance and a limited amount of paid hours. Researchers used data for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program, the Earned Income Tax Credit, food stamps and temporary cash assistance -- the country’s biggest programs for low-income families. Ken Jacobs, chairman of the Berkeley Labor Center, said the figures in the report are conservative because they do not account for other income-support programs, such as child care, rental assistance and free or reduced school feeding programs that do not have readily available data. The report relied on 2007-11 survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, federal and state data for the four social programs, U.S. Census Bureau survey data, and employer-provided statistics for fast food workers. Workers counted for the report had to put in at least 27 weeks of work a year at at least 10 hours per week, which accounted for most workers. The researchers looked at benefits on the family level because some programs do not directly support the worker but their children (CHIP) or are paid at the family level (food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit). Jacobs said he was not expecting the percentage of fast food workers who earn a public benefit to be so high. But the report acknowledges that because these programs are meant to prop up low-income households, it would seem likely for low-wage industries to employ many of the beneficiaries. To that end, the restaurant and food services industry has the highest public program participation rate of any sector, the report found. ""One argument could be, ‘This is how these programs are supposed to work,’ "" Jacobs said. ""Then you get into the question of what is better: Do we want to have large firms putting the labor costs onto the public, or should firms internalize those costs?"" Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University School of Law who supports raising the minimum wage, said Maher’s point is basically correct. ""He should have said a ‘majority’ of fast food workers (get some form of public assistance),"" Secunda said. ""That would have been more precise than ‘most.’ "" Opponents of increasing the minimum wage did criticize the center for including CHIP and the Earned Income Tax Credit as categories, as those are used by some middle-class families. The tax credit was created in 1975 to provide low-wage and moderate-wage workers with an incentive to work. Michael Saltsman of the conservative Employment Policies Institute said the EITC was designed for these workers, and it boosts wages even for families earning close to $50,000 a year. He pointed out that the EITC represents the biggest chunk of program enrollment in the study. David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine who has written against minimum wage increases, said the fact that the research was funded by a group that supports raising the minimum wage does not necessarily undermine the analysis. But Neumark doesn’t equate raising the minimum wage with less dependence on public assistance. ""We could have fewer people employed at higher wages, and some of those would use fewer public benefits,"" he said. ""But those no longer employed would be more dependent on public assistance, and lose out on the opportunity to build skills and advance out of low-wage jobs."" For its part, McDonald’s USA did not answer our questions about the average age of its restaurant workers or how many are on food assistance. A spokeswoman sent us a statement that said the chain employs hundreds of thousands of people, and ""wages are based on local wage laws and are competitive to similar jobs in that market."" Our ruling To make a point about the need to increase the minimum wage, Maher pointed to the plight of fast food workers, who, on average are 29 and receiving some form of public assistance. The median age, which economists say is a more accurate measure than the mean age, is 29, according to the best information we could find. As for receiving public assistance, Maher is referencing a university report funded by a group that supports increasing the minimum wage. The report concluded that 52 percent of the families of fast-food workers are receiving some type of public assistance. That’s not exactly how Maher put it -- he didn’t refer to families -- but some assistance programs specifically are meant to help families and children. Experts, meanwhile, said that while the methodology behind the report appears credible, there is some matter of opinion of what constitutes public assistance. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4A56C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/04/bill-maher/bill-maher-average-fast-food-worker-29-most-are-pu/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Van Jones']","
Amid swarm of canceled policies, Van Jones says individual market has always been volatile
","Opponents of President Barack Obama’s health care law are quick to evoke the plight of potentially millions of Americans getting hit by cancellation notices from their health insurance companies due to new coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act. All of a sudden, Republican critics sound like members of the consumer-first ""party of Ralph Nader,"" quipped Van Jones, the Democratic co-host of CNN’s Crossfire, during a panel discussion on ABC’s This Week. ""They're the biggest consumer protection operation in the world now, but six months ago we had people who were getting these same cancellation notices and the Republican Party was silent,"" he said. ""There's a problem when you're indifferent to the losers the last time. I want to make one thing perfectly clear. You look at the numbers here. Fourteen percent, only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years before."" Is his figure about the volatile individual market accurate? First, understand that consumers who seek health insurance coverage on their own are not the norm in this country. Most people are covered by their employer or Medicaid or Medicare. Another 16 percent are uninsured. About 6 percent, or 15 million Americans, are in the individual marketplace, which will be the most affected by the new law. That was intentional. After the show, Jones told PunditFact that the individual marketplace is a ""wild, wild west"" where people were denied coverage for pre-existing conditions and policyholders were continually dropped by insurers offering thin, sketchy coverage. The people in this unstable market are a transient bunch, signing 12-month contracts with insurers as they move between jobs or lose coverage they once had. When their contract is up, the insurer can discontinue a policy or change it. If they end it, federal law says they have to give policyholders 90 days notice and the choice to sign up for different coverage. ""Current policyholders are not having their current policy canceled – rather, the insurance company is exercising its option to discontinue the policy at the end of the contract year,"" according to Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. And now, if healthcare.gov straightens out, they can purchase new coverage there. The health care law’s authors wanted to make sure people in the individual marketplace had access to the same standardized coverage as everyone else. As a result, new policies created after the health care law passed in March 2010 must cover ""10 essential health benefits,"" such as preventive care, ambulatory service, and maternity and newborn care. Because many of these individual plans don’t offer that, and they weren’t eligible to be ""grandfathered"" under the new law, the insurers are shedding some of them. It’s a lot to take in, but it’s all part of the complicated before-and-after picture that Jones was trying to paint for viewers about the benefits of the much-maligned health care law. As for his stat that ""only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years"" before the health care law, Jones told us he was a little off. He meant to say 17 percent, a reference to a finding in a 2004 study published in the journal Health Affairs that was recently highlighted in a Washington Post explainer about the policy cancellations. The study examined coverage patterns in the individual insurance marketplace from 1996-2000 -- quite some time ago. The key finding for our purposes is this: ""Roughly one-sixth (17 percent) of those with individual insurance coverage retained it for more than two years."" The reason? Not because of insurers canceling plans like Jones suggested. Though insurers do cancel coverage, the study determined that most of the volatility with enrollment and dropped policies had to do with policyholders moving between employer coverage, with a median enrollment length of eight months. The people who kept their insurance the longest were small business employees or self-employed, the study found. So Jones is close on the number. But Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee law professor, says the number does not exactly mean what Jones said it does. Jones is saying it’s the fault of insurance companies that most people could not hold onto their coverage, but the reality is less known. It’s probably not accurate to pin it all on insurers canceling the plans, Jost said, though no one knows for sure how much of the churning has to do with insurers and people canceling their plan or choosing a new one. ""He does have a point, but I wouldn’t have said it that way,"" Jost said. ""It’s a market that has just not functioned very well. ... It’s long been the case that people just come and go from the market all the time."" Other health policy experts found Jones’ remarks confusing. Yes, the market tends to be volatile due to high administrative costs and the inability to pool risk among healthy and sick patients like large employer plans, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""Does he think Republicans should have complained about the volatility in the individual market before this? That only makes sense if they have a solution to the problem,"" she said. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius referenced another 2004 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation in an online column meant to offer some calm around the cancellation notices for individual plans. The study said about 45 percent of policies remained after two years, a much higher estimate though its sample did not include short-term health insurance policies that are often bought to cover gaps of three to six months. Our ruling Jones said, ""Only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years"" before Obamacare became law. He was trying to make the point that canceled policies have been the norm in the individual insurance market long before the Affordable Care Act. His figure is 3 percentage points off of a 2004 study that found only 17 percent of individual policyholders kept their plans for more than two years. More importantly, though, a health policy expert said Jones probably went too far in indicating that insurance companies were to blame for the high turnover. Many people enter that market for the purpose of buying short-term protection. That means people in the individual market might be dropping the health insurance plan they have as much as insurance companies might be canceling the plan altogether. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B4AAC0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/03/van-jones/amid-swarm-canceled-policies-van-jones-says-indivi/

Jonathan Karl looks back at the generic ballot in 1994 and 2010
","President Barack Obama and the Democrats got clobbered by health care in recent weeks, George Stephanopoulos said on ABC’s This Week. He asked his experts on the show: ""How do you see this playing out as we head toward the midterms next year?"" Democrats currently have about an 8-percentage point lead on what is called the ""generic ballot"" for the 2014 election, Stephanopoulos said. A generic ballot refers to a poll question that asks voters if the election were held today, would they vote for a Republican or a Democrat for Congress. Stephanopoulos and his other guests -- ABC’s Jonathan Karl and 538 blogger Nate Silver -- noted that the recent polls about Obama’s approval rating and the generic ballot don’t necessarily predict the outcome of the 2014 elections. ""And you (know) on that point, if you look at where those numbers were before the Republican wave in 2010, Democrats had an advantage on the generic ballot in Congress,"" Karl said. ""Even in 1994 with the Gingrich revolution. I mean you had, Democrats had that advantage. So it wasn't quite as big as it is now, but it wasn't much different."" We wondered about Karl’s history. Karl sent us an email stating that he was citing ABC’s polls and emailed us results for registered voters dating back to 1994. The question asked: ""If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were being held today, would you vote for (the Democratic candidate) or (the Republican candidate) in your congressional district? In October 2013, the poll showed that Democrats had the advantage 48-40. 2010 election The 2013 results in some way mirrored the results of the poll from October 2009, a little more than a year before Republicans picked up six seats in the Senate and 63 in the House. In October 2009, the ABC News poll showed Democrats leading 51-39. But by February 2010, Republicans were ahead in the same poll 48-45. Democrats pulled back ahead through June, then Republicans led in July and early September. In the final days of October, Republicans were ahead 49-45. Other polls asked the question as well, to slightly different results. In all three of the above polls, likely voters gave Republicans a significant edge in the homestretch. 1994 election It was more difficult to find polling prior to the 1994 election, which saw Republicans pick up 54 seats in the House and made the GOP the majority party for the first time since 1952. Karl sent us the results of three ABC polls in the final weeks of the 1994 election which showed the Democrats ahead by 4 or 5 percentage points: 11/6/94:  47-42                 10/31/94: 48-44                 10/23/94:  50-45                 Gallup found between March and October 1994 that the advantage went back and forth between the two parties, and was close near the end. Twice in the final weeks, it was dead even. Silver wrote in his fivethirtyeight blog that Gallup tends to show worse results for Democrats than other likely voter models. In 1994, Gallup gave the edge to Republicans while other polls gave the advantage to Democrats. Relevance of generic ballot We turned to political analyst Larry Sabato for an explanation of the relevance of generic ballots. ""The generic ballot is one important indicator of the likely outcome of U.S. House elections, though by itself it cannot predict which party will win control,"" Sabato said in an email. ""It is also true that Democrats tend to have an edge on this measure."" The problem, according to Sabato, is that Democratic voters are ""inefficiently distributed"" and concentrated in urban, minority districts. As evidence, Sabato said Democratic candidates for Congress in 2012 received more votes than their Republican counterparts, yet Republicans won a majority of seats. Our ruling Karl used polling from before the 1994 and 2010 elections to emphasize that people shouldn’t read too much into the fact that Democrats currently hold a 48-40 lead among voters who are asked generically if they’d vote for a Democrat or Republican for Congress. Karl is accurately citing ABC polling leading up to the 1994 and 2010 elections. Other polling we found does not contradict Karl’s statement.

"['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Taxes', 'PunditFact', 'Scott Brown']","
The health care law raises taxes and cuts Medicare, says Scott Brown
","Republicans have had plenty of ammo to criticize President Barack Obama’s health care reform law in recent days. From the sputtering online insurance marketplaces to the millions of Americans who will lose insurance plans that don’t meet the new law’s standards, it has been a feeding frenzy for conservatives. But speaking Nov. 3, 2013, on Fox News Sunday, senator-turned-commentator Scott Brown dredged up some old claims about the Affordable Care Act to add to the ongoing criticism. Brown was a Massachusetts state senator when then-Gov. Mitt Romney passed what would become the blueprint for Obamacare, and he compared his own state’s effort to the federal law. ""When the president was in Boston, it made my blood boil,"" Brown said. ""I worked on the Massachusetts plan. It didn’t raise taxes or cut Medicare, and this one does."" We’ll put aside for now Brown’s claims about what the Massachusetts law did and didn’t do. (For starters, it couldn’t cut Medicare because that’s a federal program). Instead, we’ll focus on Brown’s statement that Obamacare raises taxes and cuts Medicare. Raising taxes? We’ll start with Brown’s claim on taxes. The health care law requires most uninsured Americans to purchase health insurance. Individuals who don’t comply with the law face a tax penalty when they file their taxes next year. In its decision to uphold the individual mandate, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the penalty was basically a tax that Congress was imposing on people who failed to buy insurance. The contentious decision allowed Obama’s signature legislative achievement to survive a constitutional battle. There’s still plenty of debate on whether that penalty is a tax or just analogous to one. But there are other tax hikes in the law we’ve reviewed before that give Brown clearance to make his claim. A good part of the law’s new taxes are on the wealthy. High earners -- defined as households making make more than $250,000 or single people making more than $200,000 -- will see their Medicare payroll taxes go up by 0.9 percentage points, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Also, they will pay an additional tax on investment income of 3.8 percent. Other taxes in the law hit the insurance companies, the health care industry and even indoor tanning salons, including: A 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided ""Cadillac"" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2018. A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. So regardless of whether the penalty imposed on people who don’t buy insurance is a tax, there are other taxes that raise revenue to offset the costs of the new law. Cuts Medicare? This is one of the claims we’ve checked the most since the start of the 2010 midterm campaigns, and we typically rate it Mostly False or Half True, depending on the specific claim. It became a big issue in the 2012 election as well, when Romney, the Republican nominee, hoped to win over support from older voters in swing states like Florida by accusing Obama of slashing the popular entitlement program for seniors. Written into the health care law is a reduction in future Medicare spending. It is not a cut in current services. The reductions take place over the next decade (the last estimate pegged it at $716 billion over 10 years) and are achieved by offering incentives and penalties to health care providers to promote more efficient care. In an email to PolitiFact, Brown specifically pointed to stories written about cuts to Medicare Advantage, which make up about a third of the projected savings. Medicare Advantage is a program started under President George W. Bush that provides some seniors with private insurance plans. In recent years it has proven to be more costly than traditional Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act seeks to rein in the program by decreasing reimbursements and pressuring the plans to be more efficient. The Republican budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., takes advantage of Medicare savings as well. Romney continued to criticize Obama and refer to them as ""cuts"" to Medicare even as he tapped Ryan to be his 2012 running mate. It should be noted that while representing Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate, Brown voted against the Ryan plan. So we can’t call him a hypocrite. But it’s an exaggeration to say Obama is cutting Medicare. Our ruling Brown said Obamacare raises taxes and cuts Medicare, a two-pronged attack. The law definitely raises taxes. As to whether it cuts Medicare, that's a more complicated picture. The standard benefits for people on Medicare were largely left intact. The law does try to prod the health care industry and insurers who are part of Medicare to operate with more efficiency. Considering both points, we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B92240>],/factchecks/2013/nov/03/scott-brown/health-care-law-raises-taxes-and-cuts-medicare-say/
"['Corrections and Updates', 'Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Ezekiel Emanuel']","
Ezekiel Emanuel says insurance companies canceling policies, not Obama
","""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,"" is an oft-repeated claim from Affordable Care Act proponents. Most recently, the point sparked a lively debate on Fox News Sunday between Ezekiel Emanuel, a former health care adviser to President Barack Obama, and James Capretta, a conservative health policy expert. ""The president said you could keep your plan,"" Capretta said, arguing that Obama hasn’t been upfront about cancellation notices. Pressed by Capretta and host Chris Wallace, Emanuel offered a counterpoint designed to shift blame from the law to insurance companies themselves. ""No, the insurance companies are making that choice, not the president,"" he said. ""The law does not require that."" Capretta and Emanuel reiterated different versions of their opposing points for the entire 15-minute segment. The debate got so heated that Wallace quipped, ""Maybe I’ll stop calling you gentlemen."" At PunditFact, we wanted to spell out how the law affects existing plans. As we’ve noted before, the Affordable Care Act has certain standards for what qualifies as comprehensive health care coverage. Outlined in section 1302(a) of the document on page 163, these 10 ""essential health benefits"" include emergency services, maternity care and mental health care. If policyholders bought plans before Obama signed his reform into law on March 23, 2010, they’re considered ""grandfathered in."" They can keep their plans, so long as those plans don’t change much. However, insurance companies that don’t provide people with all of the benefits listed cannot market those plans to new consumers. That’s leading to insurance companies ending a lot of their grandfathered plans, which won’t be as profitable long-term without the potential attraction of new buyers. Many of the roughly 14 million people who buy their insurance individually (which means not through an employer) are receiving cancellation notices as insurers end those grandfathered plans. Emanuel’s claim indicates that blame for these plan cancellations technically falls on insurance companies, not Obama and legislators. In an email we received from him after we initially published our report, he emphasized that it's the insurers who are taking action to end the policies. How often do these types of cancellations happen? The fact is, there’s not good data available on the number of individual, non-employer cancellations, so it’s impossible to say how many health policies are canceled in a normal year versus in 2013, said Alan Sager, a Boston University public health professor who favors Obamacare. ""Some of them may be doing that because they know it’s good business to get into compliance with the law’s requirements earlier,"" Sager said. ""They may believe that offering better benefits gives them a competitive advantage."" That said, it’s hard to argue that a sweeping health care reform law has no impact on changing behaviors of insurance companies in the absence of data. One of the law’s intentions is to raise the bar for basic health benefits offered to consumers, so it’s no surprise that individual policyholders with less comprehensive plans are finding themselves with cancellation notices. Our ruling Ezekiel’s assertion that the law doesn’t require insurance companies to cancel plans hinges on a technicality. It is up to insurers how they comply with the law, which mandates that policyholders be covered for 10 ""essential health benefits,"" except for plans that are grandfathered in. But there’s little doubt the new law is influencing their changes in coverage. The law was designed to eventually do away with insurance that doesn't meet minimum coverage standards. We rate Ezekiel’s claim Mostly False. Editor's note: This report has been updated to include a response we got from Emanuel after our initial publication.

CBS' Jan Crawford says 6 people signed up on Obamacare's first day
","The failed launch of the Obamacare website healthcare.gov continued to draw plenty of attention Nov. 3, 2013, on the Sunday morning talk shows. Jan Crawford, CBS legal correspondent, said the website’s collapse stood out even more in light of the hype that led up to the opening day. ""With great fanfare they pointed to that date,"" Crawford said on Face the Nation. ""They had health care clinics across the country signing people up for appointments that day to get people in for this promise of affordable health care. On day one, six people were able to sign up."" We wondered, was it true that just six people were able to successfully enroll in plans offered through the federal insurance marketplace created as part of the new health care law? That’s what we’ll look into. For the most part, Crawford got it right. The figure of six people comes from documents released by the House committee investigating the failed rollout of Obamacare. The documents are copies of notes taken by staff at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency in charge of the website project. At the top of the notes are the words ""War room."" They were written two and three days after the site opened for business on Tuesday, Oct. 1. An entry from a meeting on Wednesday morning said ""six enrollments have occurred so far."" By the end of the second day, the notes reported 248 people had signed up and about 40,000 applications were pending. A spokesperson for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department told reporters that these were not official numbers and that people could also enroll through other means, including filling out paper applications. Some states are also operating their own insurance marketplaces. Joanne Peters, Health and Human Services spokeswoman, told Bloomberg that by the last week of October, about 700,000 people had submitted applications, with about half coming through the federal marketplace and half coming through the states. There were ongoing issues with sending enrollment information to insurance companies, Peters said. Official numbers might be released by mid November. Our ruling Crawford said that only six people had been able to sign up on the first day of open enrollment for the federal health insurance marketplace. That fits with the internal notes released by the House committee. But those were initial numbers and there is some possibility that other people could have enrolled without using the website. Official numbers are not available. With that caveat, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097176AC0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/03/jan-crawford/cbss-crawford-says-6-people-signed-obamacares-firs/

Ivanka Trump's Chinese proverb ahead of Singapore summit doesn't check out
","Ivanka Trump tweeted a subtle dig at critics of her father before he became the first sitting president to meet with a North Korean leader. ""Those who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it,"" she wrote, referencing a ""Chinese proverb"" as the source of the quote. “Those who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it.” -Chinese Proverb We noticed a lot of confusion on American and Chinese social media platforms about whether there really is a Chinese proverb that says this. One user on Weibo, China’s most popular social media website, proposed genuine Chinese proverbs resembling Ivanka Trump’s tweet, such as ""Those who can’t eat the grapes will call them sour,"" and the Confucian saying, ""That which you would not do yourself, do not force upon others."" The official account of Sina, the tech company responsible for the making of Weibo, posted a translation of Ivanka Trump’s tweet on the platform, followed by a call for assistance: ""We really can’t think of what proverb this is. Please help!"" After seeing all the disbelief from netizens around the world, we were curious whether there was any truth to Trump’s attribution of the quote. After some digging, we found no evidence that the saying is of Chinese origin. The White House did not return a request for clarification. We started by searching the quote on Google, and found a website that tracks the origin of memorable quotations named Quote Investigator. (We came across the website in our last report on a misattributed quote by Ivanka Trump.) Garson O’Toole, the founder of Quote Investigator (and whose real name is Gregory F. Sullivan) is a former teacher and research scientist in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. (He told us prefers to use the ""distinctive pseudonym"" Garson O’Toole in all matters pertaining to quotation tracing.) O’Toole told us that he works to find ""early instances of variations of a quotation which are syntactically distinct but semantically similar"" from databases of books, magazines and newspapers. O’Toole traced the first appearance of one iteration of Ivanka Trump’s tweet back to 1902, when the quotation, ""Things move along so rapidly nowadays that people saying ‘It can’t be done’ are always being interrupted by somebody doing it"" appeared in the New York-based humor magazine Puck. According to Quote Investigator, it was reprinted by newspapers for the next few decades. Then, a 1962 periodical about adult education included the expression, ""Confucius say: Man who say it cannot be done, should not interrupt man doing it."" That’s pretty similar to Ivanka Trump’s tweet, but one expert noted that the template ""Confucius say"" is a format that is frequently used for jokes and witticisms. ""Calling it a Chinese proverb is like a century ago when the fashion was to say ‘Confucius said…’ in front of a stupid remark or a weak joke,"" said Willard J. Peterson, professor of East Asian studies and history at Princeton University. The quote showed up again in 1974, when advocates for solar energy sent a letter that was eventually published in a record of a U.S. Senate hearing. The letter also credited Confucius for the saying. The quote was again ascribed to Confucius in different outlets in 1977 and 1996, suggesting that the belief that the saying is Chinese in origin may have stemmed from a misunderstood joke. That’s where our trail ran cold. So we turned to experts. No expert we spoke to could confirm that it was a Chinese proverb. ""As far as I know, there is no way for this quote to be reasonably attributed to anyone in the Chinese intellectual tradition,"" said Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at the Asia Society’s Center on U.S.-China Relations. Stone Fish said the quote sounded like an American’s take on Chinese wisdom. O’Toole wrote to us that ""the precise phrasing of statements often evolves over time."" In this case, he believes that the modern iteration of the statement that Ivanka Trump quoted ""evolved from the 1902 statement"" that was included in Puck. As for why the misattribution of quotes to Chinese origin is commonplace, Paul R. Goldin, professor of East Asian languages and civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania, told us that his guess is that ""people tend to say such-and-such is a Chinese proverb because (at least until recently) few Westerners were in any position to challenge such claims."" Goldin also said that ""China isn't the only false source that is invoked for phony quotations and proverbs,"" noting that there’s also a tendency for speakers to misattribute ""nonsense"" to sources like Oscar Wilde and Mark Twain. Meanwhile, Peterson told us that he thinks using the established words of others can be ""a way of not taking responsibility for what you are saying,"" especially if those words are likely to offend the listener.   This wasn’t the first time Trump has confused her Chinese proverbs. Quote Investigator considers the linkage of the saying ""Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life"" to Confucius to be ""spurious."" But she previously attributed the saying to the Chinese philosopher twice, once in 2013 and once in 2014. Ivanka Trump tweeted, ""Those who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it"" and attributed the quote to a ""Chinese proverb."" We found no evidence that links her quote to a Chinese proverb. Similar versions of the quote have been circulating for over 100 years and have been attributed to Confucius, possibly as a joke. Experts also could not speak to the quote’s origins, but said it was unlikely of Chinese origin.

No, Bill Clinton did not pass a law separating families
","A popular pro-Donald Trump Twitter account cast blame for family separations at the border on former Democratic presidents of decades past. ""Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America. And liberals cheered,"" Education for Liberals tweeted. ""(Barack) Obama enforced this same law throughout his entire presidency. And liberals cheered. President Trump is now left to ‘deal with it.’ And liberals are angry."" Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America.And liberals cheered.Obama enforced this same law throughout his entire presidency.And liberals cheered.President Trump is now left to “deal with it.”And liberals are angry. We’ve previously compared the practices of Trump and Obama when it came to separating families. Did Clinton pass a law that separated children from their parents? The Twitter user did not respond to multiple requests for comment. We found two major policies relating to immigration that went into effect during the Clinton administration, but neither did what the tweets said. Clinton signed an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration in 1996. But it had no provisions mandating the separation of families, experts told us. The biggest change the legislation brought about for families was deporting immigrants who were once legally in the United States but now subject to deportation because of a criminal conviction. ""The 1996 reforms made it easier to remove previously legal immigrants (many of whom had married, settled down, and had kids in the United States) for criminal conviction that had previously not made them eligible for removal,"" said Rick Su, an immigration law professor at University of Buffalo. ""Adult noncitizens who were removed sometimes chose to have U.S. citizen kids remain in the United States,"" said Peter Marguiles, law professor at Roger Williams University. ""But that was a choice made by parents, not a decision by the government."" The Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy that has resulted in family separations doesn’t stem from the enforcement of this law, however, but entry without inspection, which had been on the books for decades prior to 1996, Adam Cox, immigration law professor at NYU, told us. Despite the law on the books, immigrants entering the country illegally as families were rarely criminally prosecuted before the Trump administration. Immigrants with criminal records or illegally re-entering the country were prioritized for prosecution during more recent administrations. Of late, however, the government has cracked down on parents and children attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission, prosecuting all illegal border crossings. Children can’t go to detention centers, so they are being handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services. (More on this later.) To sum it up: The 1996 law didn’t require, nor did the Clinton administration adopt, a zero tolerance policy requiring that all noncitizens crossing the border in violation of immigration law be prosecuted for federal crimes. That’s a new policy under Trump. The tweet may also have been referring to a 1997 agreement conservatives have used to justify family separations. The Flores settlement was a January 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department. The agreement determined immigrant children must be held in the ""least restrictive setting."" The Flores agreement can be read as barring children from jail, but it doesn’t condone or require the separation of children from parents. In fact, it stresses keeping children close to parents and extended family. The Obama administration had been placing children with their parents in family detention centers, but the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 held that the Flores agreement applies to all minors, not just those traveling unaccompanied. Because the detention centers were considered restrictive, the children had to be released. The Obama administration chose to release parents alongside their children. The result of these actions left the Trump administration with three options when apprehending a family trying to cross the border illegally: release parents and their children; send parents to prison and release their children; or send parents to prison and their children to child detention facilities overseen by the government. The Trump administration chose the last option, a decision he reversed on June 20, 2018. A tweet by Education4Liberals tried to point out liberal hypocrisy toward immigrant family separations, saying ""Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America."" There is no law separating children from their parents when they enter the country illegally. The Trump administration chose to pursue that outcome as a result of its zero-tolerance policy. Clinton signed a significant immigration crackdown into law, but it mostly related to immigrants who were already living in the United States with criminal convictions, indirectly impacting some immigrant children. The Flores agreement of 1997 mandated that unaccompanied children be placed in the least restrictive setting while awaiting an immigration hearing, but that allows for a few options so that children are not required to be separated from their parents.

The story said Obama was eager to play a role in advising leading Democrats and shaping the party’s future.

Redstate Watcher responded to a Facebook message by noting that the story featured ""a clickbait title"" and criticizing readers and fact-checkers who ""pick and choose which words you feel like taking literally and which words you take figuratively.""

Has there been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years?
","President Donald Trump argued that immigrants entering illegally are gaming the American immigration system, citing a remarkable rise in asylum applications. He said some asylum seekers are actually abusing the process with criminal intentions. ""There's been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years,"" Trump said in a June 19 speech. ""Think of that. Think of that. We're a great country but you can't do that. Smugglers know how the system works. They game the system; they game it."" Has there been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims? The numbers stack up. But the claims of gaming the system are less supported. Trump is talking about ""credible fear"" cases, which is spelled out in the Refugee Act of 1980. It's available for people unable or unwilling to return to their home country ""because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.""   Migrants who are apprehended or unable to enter the country legally can claim ""credible fear"" in order to get a hearing before an immigration court. The Homeland Security Department tracks cases in which a decision to grant a hearing has been made, which differs only slightly from the number of all claims made. In 2007, 5,171 people claimed credible fear and had their cases reviewed. In 2016, it was 91,786. That represents a 1,675 percent hike, basically as Trump claimed. Between 60 and 80 percent of those cases were approved for further court review. Overall, 20 percent of applicants were ultimately granted asylum in fiscal year 2017, the Homeland Security Department told us. But that doesn’t mean asylum seekers are gaming the system. The majority have valid claims of fear in their home countries, experts told us. Louis Desipio, a University of California Irvine political science professor who specializes in immigration, told us that while more people are affirmatively expressing their right to apply for asylum, their claims are not necessarily without merit. ""Initially, a lot of migration was single males from Mexico coming for work, and now you’re seeing a shift to Central American families fleeing record levels of violence in the northern triangle"" of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, said Joshua Breisblatt, a senior policy analyst at the American Immigration Council. ""There is no indication that that’s an increase in fraud, that’s just something that is happening in the United States’ backyard."" Asylum requests by citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras made up 72.9 percent of total claims in fiscal year 2016. ""Our laws are clear,"" said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ""If you express a fear of returning to your home country, you have a right to a credible fear screening. If the asylum officer finds you have a credible fear of persecution in your home country, then you have a right to have an immigration judge hear your case."" Under the last several administrations, Customs and Border Protection increased its use of expedited removal, according to Lenni B. Benson, a law professor at New York Law School. Given the only way to stop an expedited removal order is to seek a credible fear review, Benson said this might explain the hike in numbers. As we noted, the overall grant rate for all asylum applications nationwide was 20 percent in fiscal year 2017, a percentage hasn’t changed much since 2012. But Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government who has interviewed hundreds of migrants for immigration research, said the variation in numbers between case approvals and asylum application approvals does not prove fraud, either. In order to get their cases of asylum initially approved, immigrants arriving illegally must fill out a survey to show whether their conditions qualify under the definition of persecution. In order to prove they merit asylum, they must show evidence they often lack before a court. The United States has also narrowed its standards for asylum under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Desipio said, precluding victims of domestic abuse and gang violence from qualifying for asylum. ""It’s very complicated for these people,"" Correa said. ""How, if they are in the United States after that very difficult journey, are they going to prove they have been extorted, show that their kids have been recruited by gangs?"" Correa said there are definitely cases of fraud by smugglers who attempt to reunite children with their parents. But there are also families fleeing situations of extreme insecurity. Trump said, ""There's been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years."" There was a 1,675 percent increase in asylum claims reviewed by the Homeland Security Department from 2008 to 2017. But that does not evidence fraud, as Trump suggested. Record levels of violence and persecution abroad largely explain the rise in asylum claims, experts told us. While the percentage of individuals whose asylum claims are approved by the Justice Department is relatively low, it might be explained by the much higher bar set by a court appearance than the completion of a survey. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096769F80>],/factchecks/2018/jun/21/donald-trump/1700-percent-increase-asylum-claims/

Trump changes course, stops family separation at the border
","Since early June, President Donald Trump has insisted that his hands were tied and families who wanted to enter America without permission had to be separated. The adults went to one place to await criminal charges, while their children were sent to another facility. As the number of children being held rose above 2,000, Trump continued to blame the Democrats for blocking a solution. ""I hate the children being taken away,"" Trump told reporters June 15. ""The Democrats have to change their law. That’s their law."" Pressed on the option to use executive action, Trump said ""you can’t do it through an executive order."" Flash forward. Sitting in the Oval Office June 20, Trump signed an executive order that directed the Homeland Security Department to ""maintain custody of alien families"" while their cases move through the immigration system, ""to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations."" ""It's about keeping families together, while at the same time being sure we have a very powerful very strong border and border security will be equal, if not greater than previously,"" Trump said. Trump’s order sounds at odds with his previous statements, so we wanted to examine Trump’s shift on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures an official’s consistency on an issue. While families attempting to enter the country had been separated in the past, immigration officials did so as an exception and not a rule. It was only in April when Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings that the numbers of separated families ballooned. Previously, first-time offenders, who often sought asylum, were put on a legal path that left them free to come back for a hearing. Under the new policy, government agents charged undocumented people with a crime and sent them directly to detention centers. Any children were sent to be cared for in separate facilities. According to the latest reports, the government was holding over 2,300 minors  under the age of 12. The outcry against the practice grew steadily louder. Democrats railed against the zero-tolerance policy and visited the centers where the children were kept. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told Trump he could change the situation with the stroke of a pen.  A dozen Republican senators called on Sessions to change policies to end the separations. Through it all, Trump and his allies were adamant: As much as they didn’t like taking children from their parents, they insisted it was inevitable. ""It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation,"" Trump tweeted June 20. ""If the Democrats would sit down instead of obstructing, we could have something done very quickly,"" he said at a June 18 White House event. ""Good for the children, good for the country, good for the world. It could take place quickly."" Attorney General Sessions cited the Bible as the foundation for enforcing a zero-tolerance policy. ""I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes,"" Sessions said June 14 in Fort Wayne, Ind. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said, ""It is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally in the United States. Congress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix it."" But with two-thirds of the public saying they opposed breaking up families, and religious leaders including Pope Francis calling it morally unacceptable, Trump changed his mind. Trump’s executive order reversing the practice continued to argue that Congress’ inaction allowed the situation to happen. ""It is unfortunate that Congress’s failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law,"" it says. Nonetheless, it goes on to announce a ""temporary detention policy"" for keeping apprehended families together through court proceedings — breaking from his administration’s prior choice of enforcement. The order calls on all government agencies, especially the Defense Department, to provide any facilities that might be suitable to house families. For the Pentagon, that could include building new housing. Trump also told the attorney general to ask for a federal district court to allow the detention of families under a 1997 agreement known as the Flores settlement. The Obama administration had tried something similar. ""The Flores settlement will need to be revised to allow indefinite detention of children,"" said immigration law professor and dean of the UC Davis School of Law Kevin Johnson. ""That seems unlikely. The court refused to allow the Obama administration to detain children for long periods in response to the influx of Central Americans in 2014."" Trump’s order also directs the attorney general to ""prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained families."" It was not clear how or if the policy would affect children already separated from their families. Trump promised ""you will have lots of happy people,"" but the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the children’s care, said in a statement ""it is still very early, and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter."" The statement said it aims to reunify the children with their parents. Trump said the zero-tolerance policy remains in effect. Trump said he couldn’t change the policy of separating children from their parents at the border. It was up to Democrats to change it. Then he signed an executive order to end the policy. The order is clearly at odds with Trump’s previous statements.

Is CPS the most understaffed district in Illinois?
","Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s oversight of the Chicago Public Schools is shaping up to be a flashpoint in his 2019 reelection bid, especially after a recent Chicago Tribune investigation highlighted the district’s failure to protect students from sexual abuse by school workers. One challenger to Emanuel is Troy LaRaviere, the head of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association and a onetime CPS elementary school principal himself who has long been a vocal critic of the mayor. LaRaviere, in a recent blog post, sought to connect the dots between the Tribune’s findings and staffing shortages at CPS. ""Under Emanuel, CPS has become the most understaffed school district in Illinois,"" LaRaviere wrote, going on to suggest that key elements of a quality education, including student safety, are more likely to slip through the cracks with less staff around. LaRaviere’s claim about safety is speculation. But his assertion about staffing levels is something concrete and led us to wonder: Is CPS really dead last in the state when it comes to staffing? If so, that would seem to contradict a common narrative about an unwieldy bureaucratic bloat at CPS. So we decided to take a look. To support his claim, LaRaviere pointed us to data from the Illinois State Board of Education listing the pupil-to-staff ratio for each district in the state. That figure includes teachers, administrators and professional staff like counselors, librarians and nurses certified by the state to work with students. The state dataset shows CPS has fewer staff members per student than all but two of the more than 850 school districts in Illinois. It was tied for second-to-last with Lincoln Way Community High School District in suburban New Lenox. In last place was a tiny elementary district in downstate Breese, 40 miles east of St. Louis. In 2016, the average student-to-staff ratio for all Illinois school districts was 11-to-one. At CPS it was more than 16-to-one. The state data also show that CPS’ ranking has worsened under Emanuel. In the 2010-11 school year, the last under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, CPS staffing levels were low but still better than 79 other districts in the state. In other words, LaRaviere’s claim checks out. Still, that raises a question: How did CPS staffing slip so far even as its spending per pupil outpaces the state average by $2,000? LaRaviere sees that conundrum as evidence CPS is wasting money because of unsound financial policies that drain resources to pay for adequate staffing. But experts also point to other, less politically fraught, explanations. Andy Crosby, a professor of public administration at Pace University in New York said urban districts are more likely to serve students from low-income backgrounds who may require additional resources to educate. Districts in large urban areas, he said, typically pay teachers higher salaries to compensate for increased cost of living as well. But he also pointed to U.S. Census data showing Chicago was far from the biggest spender among large urban school districts. In 2015, the data show, New York City spent roughly $22,000 per student while Chicago spent less than $14,000. Illinois data, meanwhile, show that Chicago’s per-student spending may be above average, yet there are many districts in the state that spend far more. Another factor to consider when weighing spending at CPS is the looming shadow of high pension costs. Prior to changes made by state lawmakers last year, CPS bore the entire expense of funding the employer share of pensions for its teachers and staff. All other districts in Illinois relied on state taxpayers to pick up their pension tab. Rebecca Hendrick, a professor of public administration at the University of Illinois-Chicago, suggested the pension overhang could be putting pressure on the district to lower operating costs to free up funds for pension payments. Those payments ramped up significantly during Emanuel’s second term as a consequence of years of contribution deferrals that began under Daley. A recent Tribune investigation revealed CPS’ failure to protect students from sexual abuse by district employees. LaRaviere suggested staffing levels could have played a role in that scandal, saying that, ""under Emanuel, CPS has become the most understaffed school district in Illinois."" The correlation LaRaviere sought to make is impossible to prove. However, his claim about low staff-to-student ratios lies on firmer ground. Data from the Illinois State Board of Education show that last year CPS employed just one staffer—teachers, administrators and other trained professionals—for every 16 students. The statewide average was one per every 11. By that measure, CPS tied for second to worst in the state. Technically speaking then, CPS is not the most understaffed in the state as LaRaviere says. It is almost the most understaffed, a quibbling distinction that might bear relevance in math class or on the debate club but is besides the point for purposes of evaluating the credibility of his claim. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096953100>],/factchecks/2018/jun/21/troy-laraviere/cps-most-understaffed-district-illinois/

Jim Spencer: May 2018 marked 401st month of global temperature exceeding 20th-century average
","A reader inquired about an Austin weathercaster saying the planet has sweltered through hundreds of months of consecutive record temperatures. ""Last week, Jim Spencer said during his weather forecast that record-breaking heat has been going on for over 400 months,"" the reader said by email. KXAN-TV’s Spencer, the reader said, had called April 2018 the 400th straight month with global temperatures above the 20th century average and that when May data was official, that would mark month 401, the reader said. We didn’t track down such a broadcast. But when we asked Spencer about making the statement, he pointed by email to his June 18, 2018, blog post stating that May 2018 ""marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with"" global land and ocean ""temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average."" All those months? We launched this fact-check. NOAA conclusion Spencer told us he relied on information posted online the day of his post by the National Centers for Environmental Information, which is in the authoritative National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. According to the centers, the report, ""Assessing the Global Climate in May 2018,"" was developed by its scientists as ""part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making."" In May 2018, the assessment states, Earth’s temperature across global land and ocean surfaces ran 1.44 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average of 58.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The report also says: ""The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.58°F above average. May 2018 also marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average,"" the report states. That 20th century average, USA Today said in a May 2018 news story, serves climate scientists as a benchmark for global temperature measurements. That's because it's fixed in time, the story said, ""allowing for consistent ‘goal posts’ when reviewing climate data. It's also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability."" Land temperatures alone, the centers’ assessment says, ran 2.05 degrees Fahrenheit above the comparable 20th century average of 52 degrees Fahrenheit. In May 2018, the report says, record ""warmth was observed across parts of North America, Europe and Asia as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Record cold May temperatures were limited to northeastern Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean, off the southern coast of Greenland."" An accompanying text box says: ""As a whole, North America had its highest May temperature since 1998 and the second highest since continental records began in 1910. The contiguous U.S. had its warmest May since records began in 1895."" State climatologist For another perspective, we asked John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist based at Texas A&M University, about Spencer’s citation of the global temperature analysis. By email, Nielsen-Gammon credited Spencer with accurately rendering NOAA’s 401-month finding though he also noted that other researchers analyze changes in temperature over time, reaching varied consecutive-month conclusions. Nielsen-Gammon said that in response to our inquiry he checked several other analyses. ""NOAA happens to have the longest streak of temperatures above the 20th century average, which may be why that particular statistic seems to be quoted most often with the NOAA data,"" Nielsen-Gammon wrote. The climatologist said other analysts reported ongoing streaks ranging from 399 months per figures compiled by British researchers to as few as 291 months, according to figures analyzed by Berkeley Earth, a California-based nonprofit. ""So speaking scientifically, it has almost certainly been at least 291 consecutive months of global temperatures above the 20th century mean, and probably much longer, with 399 or 401 months being the best estimates,"" Nielsen-Gammon said. ""If you believe the NOAA estimate, it's 401 months."" Nielsen-Gammon elaborated: ""What this means is that average global temperatures have increased so much that not even natural variability can produce a month colder than the 20th century average, and hasn't been able to do so for some time. The global warming signal is well above the noise level. At this rate, about the only thing strong enough to cancel out global warming for a month would be a volcanic eruption much stronger than Krakatau."" Federal official reaffirms 401-month mark We also heard back by email from Derek ""Deke"" Arndt of the NCEI, who reaffirmed its 401-month finding which, he said, traces to the NOAA Merged Land Ocean Global Surface Temperature Analysis Dataset containing monthly readings all the way back to January 1880. Asked why other researchers have indicated fewer months of global temperatures exceeding the 20th-century average, Arndt said he believes those others draw on different datasets. We also alerted Spencer to the alternate findings of fewer months in a row when the planet’s temperature outpaced the 20th-century average. By email, Spencer noted that Nielsen-Gammon described 399 or 401 months as the best estimates. Our ruling Spencer wrote that May 2018 marked the 401st straight month of global temperatures exceeding the 20th century average. This claim accurately echoes the findings of respected NOAA researchers. Missing: Clarification that other entities have reported fewer consecutive months that this pattern has held, possibly as few as 291 months. We rate Spencer's claim Mostly True.

States with voter ID laws have seen 'zero decrease' in turnout, NC Republican says
","Should North Carolina residents have to show photo identification to vote? Republicans who control North Carolina’s state legislature are considering the requirement, and have proposed putting a referendum on the November ballot. Those who support the idea say it’s needed to prevent people from impersonating one another. Critics, meanwhile, say photo ID requirements discriminate against poor people and minorities who may not have driver’s licenses or other forms of photo ID. They also say photo ID is unnecessary, since reports of voter fraud in North Carolina are rare and tend to occur not at polling sites but with mail-in ballots. State Rep. Tim Moore, the Republican House speaker, recently defended the idea in an interview with Spectrum News. Reporter Loretta Boniti asked Moore whether an ID requirement might suppress votes. ""Not at all,"" Moore said in the June 7 interview. ""States that have adopted voter identification laws have seen zero decrease in voter participation. In fact, most have seen an increase in voter participation."" He went on to say that, ""When it comes to voter participation, it's generally dependent on what kind of cycle it is."" We decided to look at what has happened in states that did what Republicans would like to do in North Carolina. Was there no decline in voter participation, as Moore said? Thirty-four states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls. Seven states — Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin — have what the National Conference of State Legislatures refers to as ""strict photo ID"" requirements. By ""strict,"" the NCSL means that voters in those states who don’t present acceptable photo ID must vote on a provisional ballot and then come back with an acceptable ID after Election Day for it to be counted. Voting laws in NC In North Carolina, voters don't have to show photo ID when they vote or register to vote. The proposed ballot question is vague, leaving it up to the legislature to fill in the details on what kinds of IDs would be needed. The North Carolina legislature, which has been controlled by Republicans since 2011, adopted a voter ID law in 2013 that limited voting options and required voters to show photo ID at the polls. Federal appellate judges struck that law down in 2016, saying the restrictions ""target African Americans with almost surgical precision."" In his interview, Moore didn’t specify what he meant by ""voter ID"" or ""participation."" Joseph Kyzer, Moore’s communications director, clarified in an email to PolitiFact that Moore was referring to total turnout. ""While fluctuations in voter participation between election cycles are common, none of the extensive studies on this issue have demonstrated that voter ID decreased total turnout in the thirty-two states that have some form of voter ID,"" Kyzer said. But total turnout — the percentage of eligible voters that make it to the polls — is not the contentious point with voter ID. Turnout is higher in presidential years, an exciting governor’s race increases interest, and other factors drive turnout. The voter ID debate hinges on whether these laws systematically put certain types of voters at a disadvantage compared to others. That was at the heart of the federal appeals court ruling. Effects of voter ID ""Turnout alone doesn’t tell the whole story,"" said Myrna Perez, deputy director of the Democracy Program of the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. ""The portion of the population without the ID can be suppressed, and at the same time, people who do have the ID can turn out in larger numbers."" Among the most cited and respected studies on the impact of voter ID laws was one conducted in 2014 by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. The GAO did its own study while examining 10 others. When comparing the 2008 and 2012 elections, the GAO analysis found that turnout decreases in Kansas and Tennessee ""were attributable to changes in those two states’ voter ID requirements."" And of the 10 studies the GAO reviewed, five found that ID requirements had no statistically significant effect on turnout; four found decreases in turnout and one found an increase in turnout. ""Although not the final word on this question, the GAO study provides credible evidence that strict ID requirements may depress turnout,"" said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. ""It remains clear that the best research on this topic does not support the idea that voter participation increases as a result of a voter ID law, with about half of studies unable to detect a statistically significant effect on turnout and the other half of studies finding a small negative effect on turnout,"" he added. On the other hand, Adam Berinsky, director of the political experiments research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said ""the research findings are mixed. So ‘zero decrease’ may be going too far, but there is no clear evidence of decrease."" As for Moore’s claim of an increase in participation, ""That seems clearly beyond the scope of findings from credible research,"" Berinsky said. Votes blocked Several experts pointed to a paper by Benjamin Highton, a professor at UC-Davis, as a good summary of the situation. Highton acknowledges a lack of conclusive studies, but notes ""even if we posit that voter identification laws have no influence on turnout because all those without valid identification who would otherwise vote take the necessary steps to obtain proper identification in advance of Election Day, these people do face a higher barrier to voting."" Photo ID laws are a ""barrier,"" Highton said, and the barrier is ""real, nontrivial, and unequal in impact."" Moore’s office pointed to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article showing that turnout rose among black and Hispanic voters from 2006 to 2010 — despite adoption of a new voter ID law in 2007. But the same article noted that the ID requirements blocked some votes from being counted. Under Georgia’s law, an in-person voter who arrives without a photo ID may cast a provisional ballot. The provisional ballot is counted only if the person returns with proper identification by the Friday following the election. ""Records show that since 2008, 2,244 provisional ballots were cast by voters lacking photo ID. Of those, 658 returned with an ID and 1,586 did not — meaning their votes did not count,"" the AJC reported. North Carolina’s short-lived voter ID law yielded similar results. In the state’s 2016 presidential primary, 1,276 ballots weren’t counted because the voter didn’t bring ID to the polls, according to Josh Lawson, general counsel for the N.C. Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement. Of those who did not bring photo ID with them to the polls, nearly 1,100 who possessed valid IDs failed to return to their county board of elections to show their IDs before results were certified, so their votes did not count. An algorithm developed by professors at Tufts and Harvard universities recently found that, in Texas, voters who were black and Hispanic were less likely to have IDs than whites. Their research methods are considered among the most precise for tracking voters, as explained by Wired Magazine. Both sides point to studies Moore’s office pointed to a mixture of academic studies, news articles and opinion columns to support his claim. They look at individual results from specific states, as well as the broad effects of voter ID on turnout. Indiana adopted a voter ID law in 2005. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a liberal Washington think tank that focuses on issues of race, found that black turnout in the 2008 election was at a historic high after rising substantially from 2004. Hans von Spakovsky, a proponent for voter ID and senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, noted the rise in black turnout in both Indiana and Georgia in a 2009 column. A 2017 study by a trio of professors from UC-San Diego and Bucknell University, ""Voter Identification Laws and the Suppression of Minority Votes,"" found ""a significant drop in minority participation"" in states that implemented strict voter ID laws between 2006 and 2014. But that finding was disputed in another study by five professors who argued the trio used unreliable data to reach their conclusions. (Moore’s office cited that subsequent study to support his claim that there’s no evidence photo ID laws affect voter turnout.) Still, contrary to Moore’s ""zero decrease"" statement, available data suggest that voter ID can decrease voter participation. Eitan Hersh, who is one of those five professors and also was among the developers of the algorithm used to track Texas voters, said that Moore’s statement is ""misleading"" since some voters struggle to obtain ID. ""At the same time, measuring an aggregate effect of ID laws is hard and there hasn’t been decisive evidence about how many people are actually deterred from these laws,"" Hersh said in an email. ""There has also been no good evidence to suggest the laws increase turnout."" Justin Grimmer, another of the five professors, said Moore is exaggerating the research conclusions. ""The best I could say is (it’s) lacking a lot of context,"" Grimmer said. ""Acceptable IDs are not held by everyone and disproportionately minorities and low income people don't have IDs. Therefore, if there is a mechanical deterrence effect of ID laws, then it will harm minorities. This was the line of argument used in the Texas ID law case and I find it convincing."" PolitiFact ruling Moore said ""states that have adopted voter identification laws have seen zero decrease in voter participation. In fact, most have seen an increase in voter participation."" There’s a kernel of truth in Moore’s statement, as studies haven't consistently shown a direct relationship between voter ID laws and voter participation. However, a report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found some evidence that participation declines. And experts said studies don't show an increase in participation as a result of voter ID. Moore’s claim that there has been ""zero decrease"" in voter participation is a misleading exaggeration. We rate his claim Mostly False. '",[<zip object at 0x00000280971C4A80>],/factchecks/2018/jun/20/tim-moore/states-voter-id-laws-have-seen-zero-decrease-turno/

Has Trump backer and Senate candidate Leah Vukmir changed position on separating families at border?
","Amid a growing uproar, has Republican U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir -- a consistently hardline supporter of President Donald Trump -- changed her position on separating children from their parents at the border? Read our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race We turn to the Flip-O-Meter, which examines an official's consistency on an issue. It does not pass a judgment on a politician who changes positions, or determine if any shift is good policy or good politics. Vukmir is running against Kevin Nicholson in the August 2018 GOP primary. The winner takes on first-term Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the November 2018 general election. News reports indicated a change on Vukmir’s part. So, let’s take a closer look. What’s been happening As PolitiFact National has reported: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April 2018 announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution.

A good number of these people are adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. Instead, kids are placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter until they can be released to a legal guardian.

Some 2,000 children have been separated from the adults they were traveling with across the U.S. border, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The children were separated from 1,940 adults from April 19 through May 31, 2018, as a result of border-crossing prosecutions. Now to what Vukmir has said. ‘Process has to be upheld’ Vukmir had this exchange with Milwaukee-based TV show host Mike Gousha during a June 8, 2018 interview (broadcast June 10, 2018): Gousha: ""Do you have any concerns about some of the reports coming from along the border that say that people who are either seeking asylum or are trying to cross into the country illegally -- that parents and children are being separated? Do you have concerns about that?"" Vukmir: ""Obviously, and I am going to have to watch that very closely. But people are taking advantage of our generosity in this country and I believe we are a nation of laws, and we have to stand up and uphold those laws ….There is a process that has to be upheld."" Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc So, Vukmir states concern about separating children from their parents at the border. But she does not express opposition to the practice and says laws must be upheld. Vukmir had a different take 11 days later. ‘Shouldn’t be separated’ Vukmir made this statement to the Associated Press on June 19, 2018: ""Of course families shouldn’t be separated. I was discussing this with"" U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., ""and he told me they’d be having a hearing as soon as next week to move on a fix to address this problem right away."" This is a shift. Vukmir is saying the practice of separating children from their parents should not happen. The next day, Trump himself changed positions. As USA Today reported: ""President Trump, facing a national outcry, said Wednesday he would sign an executive order to keep migrant families together at the border, abandoning his earlier claim that the crisis was caused by an iron-clad law and not a policy that he could reverse."" On that, Vukmir’s campaign told us Vukmir is ""glad"" about Trump’s decision and ""now we need to focus on fixing our broken immigration system, and that begins with securing our borders."" Our rating Our ratings on the Flip-O-Meter are: No Flip – No significant change in position.

Half Flip – A partial change in position.

Full Flop – A complete change in position. Vukmir never explicitly declared support for separating children from their parents at the border. But she went from stating no opposition to the practice, and saying laws must be upheld, to saying it shouldn’t happen. For a partial change in position, we give Vukmir a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3C9240>],/factchecks/2018/jun/20/leah-vukmir/has-trump-backer-and-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-/

Corey Stewart's misleading comments on Sen. Tim Kaine and Antifa
","Corey Stewart, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Virginia, promised a ruthless campaign against incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine. A day after securing his party’s nomination, he tweeted one of his first attacks. ""Virginia's sitting senator approves of and even applauds his son's participation in a known terrorist organization, #Antifa,"" Stewart wrote June 13, 2018.  Virginia's sitting senator approves of and even applauds his son's participation in a known terrorist organization, #Antifa. Let that sink in. https://t.co/7foEPLKYHT Kaine’s son, Linwood Michael ""Woody"" Kaine, has indeed attended protests affiliated with Antifa, a far-left collection of autonomous anti-fascist groups that are spread throughout the country and share several causes, including the resistance of white supremacist movements. Because Antifa is an umbrella term for many different groups, it does not have an official website or membership. When asked for evidence to support the tweet, Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch pointed to an article in The Federalist, a conservative website, about Woody Kaine’s arrest for counter-protesting at a pro-Donald Trump rally held in the state Capitol in Minnesota on March 4, 2017. According to local reports, Woody Kaine was one of six counter-protesters arrested by St. Paul Police. He was part of a group of approximately 100 counter-protestors, some of whom set off smoke bombs and fireworks inside the building. Witnesses reported seeing Antifa flags in the crowd of counter-protestors. Though peaceful during the rally, police said the younger Kaine tried to run when approached by an officer and that he had to be restrained. A judge sentenced him to a year of probation and ordered him to pay $236 in fines and fees for resisting arrest. Other counter-protestors were charged with felonies for using tear gas. ""While some were charged for disruptive activity at the rally, Woody behaved peacefully there and faced no such charges,"" said Kaine spokeswoman Miryam Lipper after the sentencing. ""He has pled guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with actions during an arrest after leaving the rally."" Fritsch said another statement issued jointly by the senator and his wife shortly after the arrest showed that Kaine approves of his son’s Antifa participation. ""We love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues,"" the couple said via a spokesperson. ""They fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully."" But elsewhere, Kaine has been more forceful in his condemnation of non-peaceful protests. In a Sept. 8, 2017, letter sent to constituents inquiring about Antifa, Kaine wrote, ""I condemn all violence at any political demonstration, including any violent activities by members of Antifa."" (We obtained a copy of the letter from Ian Sams, communications director for Kaine’s re-election campaign). ""I have spent my whole life fighting for people and causes I care about, but always peacefully,"" Kaine said. ""Whether in the form of civil discourse or peaceful protest, Americans should continue to have frank discussions with each other and with their leaders."" Sams noted that Kaine also expressed his preference for civil discourse in an op-ed published to CNN. ""We must always balance that popular activism with a requirement to be peaceful — violence has no place in civic discussion,"" he wrote. ""We cannot tolerate violence by anyone, of any political viewpoint, if we truly embrace the principles expressed in the Constitution."" ""Peacefully protesting at a rally does not equate to being a member of Antifa,"" Sams said. For the record, characterizations differ as to whether Antifa qualifies as ""a known terrorist organization."" According to a 2017 Politico report, the Department of Homeland Security formally classified Antifa activities as ""domestic terrorist violence"" in 2016. The Southern Poverty Law Center, by contrast, does not recognize Antifa as a hate group because ""antifa groups do not promote hatred based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity,"" even if it does display a ""propensity for violence."" It is also worth noting that the image Stewart quote-tweeted was doctored to show Kaine presenting before Congress with a poster board of his son’s face. (A hammer and sickle is plastered in the top corner.) In the real photo, Kaine was presenting beside a poster-sized image of a Trump tweet. Sams noted that this is not the first misleading image Stewart has shared in support of the same claim. In August 2017, Stewart tweeted a photo of Antifa — and said Kaine’s son was pictured — that had previously appeared in a Swedish blog more than a year before the Minnesota rally. This was also not Stewart's first misleading tweet related to Kaine's son. In May 2018, for example, he tweeted that Woody Kaine ""attacked elderly people entering a Trump rally."" Kaine has encouraged his son and others to peacefully express their political views. But Stewart’s statement that Kaine ""approves of and even applauds his son’s participation in a known terrorist organization"" implied that Kaine has indicated he would be okay with his son’s participation in the violence at Antifa protests, as well. Kaine’s statements tell a different story — namely, that he approves of his son’s Antifa-related protests only when they are peaceful. Kaine has more than once advocated for peaceful protest, and he has also condemned the violence that has driven some to label Antifa as a terrorist group. We rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False.

Corey Stewart's history with the far right, explained
","A history with the fringe right has cast an early shadow over Republican Corey Stewart in his bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, despite efforts to deny past associations. In a fiery interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo on June 13, 2018, Stewart repeatedly denied that he had previously supported or accepted support from white supremacists and anti-Semites, calling Cuomo’s assertion a lie and an example of playing ""the race card.""  Corey Stewart, the projected GOP nominee for US Senate in Virginia, repeatedly accused Democrats of using “the race card” to distract from President Trump’s success https://t.co/EP8a3kaRcN pic.twitter.com/TJqOSX87Tx Stewart also hurled insults at both Kaine and Cuomo, telling the CNN host he should be fired for dishonesty and that Cuomo’s own late father was anti-Semitic. The exchange turned contentious when Cuomo asked about Stewart’s history with Paul Nehlen, a far-right conservative now making his second run for Congress in Wisconsin. ""You have a well pronounced past of saying that you agree with and that you like people who push ugly, bigoted, intolerant and racist notions,"" Cuomo said, pointing to a fact sheet on Stewart’s relationship with Nehlen. ""Hey, that’s a level of lie that’s just not true, Chris,"" Stewart responded. ""Even for CNN, to go that far, that is not the case at all. I have always condemned … any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that. We want nothing to do with that."" Stewart said he distanced himself from Nehlen after the far-right commentator began tweeting expressions of hatred toward Jews and Muslims, adding that ""everybody supported Paul Nehlen"" and that ""back in the day he was not like that, at least as far as I knew."" Cuomo said Nehlen had already sent anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim tweets in 2016, before Stewart first praised him. He also asked about Richard Hines, a prominent member of the neo-Confederate movement who endorsed Stewart during his campaign for governor in 2017. We decided to take a look at Stewart’s history with white supremacy and anti-Semitism and see how the claim that he has ""always condemned"" both checks out. On Jan. 20, 2017, the night of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Stewart met with Nehlen at the Virginia Women for Trump ball. Stewart, who was running for governor at the time, called Nehlen ""one of my personal heroes"" and said he was ""inspired"" by him. Later that night, Stewart tweeted a photo with Nehlen, writing that he was ""so honored"" to receive his endorsement. Stewart has since deleted the post. Soon after, in February 2017, Nehlen wrote on Twitter that Islam was not a religion of peace and posted a photo of a plane striking the World Trade Center with the caption, ""9/11 would’ve been a Wonderful #DayWithoutImmigrants."" In the following months, Nehlen also tweeted that ""Islam is not your friend,"" implied that Muslim no-go zones in Western countries should be bombed and retweeted posts saying Bill and Hillary Clinton were murdering associates. At the same time, he was tweeting out support for Stewart’s gubernatorial bid against Ed Gillespie, who eventually won the party’s nomination. Nehlen’s tweets escalated the next year. In January, he wrote on Twitter that most of his critics were Jewish, and in February, his account was banned after he targeted Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, with a racist tweet. (We accessed Nehlen’s tweets using a CNN archive). After Nick Freitas, Stewart’s primary opponent, helped resurface the video of Stewart and Nehlen on social media in June, Stewart disavowed the self-proclaimed ""pro-white"" candidate, telling the Washington Post he had praised Nehlen ""before he went nuts and started spewing a bunch of stupid stuff"" and tweeting, ""Paul Nehlen has lost his marbles and needs serious help."" But the condemnation was a long time coming, and Stewart was wrong to tell Cuomo he had separated himself from Nehlen as soon as he started ""coming out with all those terrible things, those anti-Semitic things, those bigoted things."" According to a June 2017 campaign finance filing with the Virginia Department of Elections, Stewart paid ""Paul Nehlen Group"" $759 as a ""fundraising commission"" in May 2017 — months after Nehlen had started posting problematic content to Twitter. Stewart spokesman Noel Fritsch told CNN the campaign had used the money to borrow Nehlen’s email list. And as Cuomo pointed out, Nehlen had retweeted anti-Muslim posts and tweets demanding that Twitter lift its ban on anti-Semite Ricky Vaughn’s account in 2016, before Stewart praised him at the inauguration-day ball. That same year, Nehlen also said he would be open to deporting all Muslims and monitoring all mosques, per The New York Times. Stewart received an endorsement for governor from Jason Kessler, organizer of the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in June 2017 after joining him at a February 2017 event sponsored by Unity and Security for America, Kessler’s organization. Kessler did not rise to prominence until the events at Charlottesville, but Stewart did cozy up to him in the months leading up to the rally.  If you live in Virginia you have to Vote for Corey Stewart today. Then bring out all your friends to vote for him too. #VAPrimary pic.twitter.com/05RVDGKWhI As with Nehlen, Stewart has distanced himself from Kessler. ""Nobody knew who Kessler was back then,"" Stewart said, likely in reference to their February 2017 meeting, during a June 12, 2018, interview quoted in The New York Times. ""Certainly I didn’t. I didn’t know he stood for all those horrible things. I want nothing to do with those things."" Richard Hines, a prominent member of the neo-Confederate movement who once called Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, South Carolina’s ""Sikh-Hindu governor"" and said a Richmond statue to black tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. was offensive to his heritage, also endorsed Stewart’s gubernatorial campaign in a video posted to his Facebook page. In the video, Stewart addressed the crowd from in front of a wall-sized Confederate flag. We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any mention of Stewart disavowing Hines. Stewart told Cuomo that he has ""always condemned … any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that."" Over the last several years, Stewart developed public relationships with Nehlen, Kessler and Hines. Although Stewart has distanced himself from Nehlen and Kessler during his campaign for the Senate, he has not always condemned their beliefs. It was only in the face of mounting public pressure that he spoke out against them, and even then it took him some time. We rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False. Clarification: This fact-check has been updated to more precisely refer to a previous Nehlen tweet. Our ruling remains the same. Correction: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly said Stewart's donation to the Paul Nehlen Group occurred after Nehlen had been removed from Twitter. The donation occurred in May 2017, and Nehlen was removed in February 2018. Our ruling remains the same.

Fake news says Pope called for world wide gun confiscation except for the UN
","The Common Sense Show, an online program with the tagline ""Freeing America one enslaved mind at a time,"" took Pope Francis to task for his stance on weapons. ""The Pope has said we need to take away all guns -- total gun confiscation across the planet "" show host Dave Hodges said May 3, 2018. ""But he does say the U.N. should be the only group that has guns."" Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. We reached out to Hodges through his website to learn the source behind his statement. We didn’t hear back. We searched the Nexis database of news reports and did not find anything that backed up this claim, but it’s possible that he’s conflated a couple of speeches from the pope. Pope Francis spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015. There, he called for a world free of nuclear weapons, and an end to ""violence against ethnic and religious minorities."" Speaking of the Middle East and Africa, he decried the situations where innocent people ""have been forced to witness the destruction of their places of worship, their cultural and religious heritage, their houses and property, and have faced the alternative either of fleeing or of paying for their adhesion to good and to peace by their own lives, or by enslavement."" In that speech, Francis spoke of ""the negative effects of military and political interventions which are not coordinated between members of the international community."" If that’s the source of Hodges’ statement, it doesn’t match what he described. There’s no call for universal collection of guns, nor did he specify that the United Nations would be the only group that can coordinate military interventions. In fact, when the pope visited Central African Republic, his call for peace between warring Christian and Muslim factions acknowledged there is an appropriate role for arms. ""To all those who unjustly use weapons in this world, I appeal: Put down your weapons of death; arm yourselves instead with justice, love, mercy and authentic guarantees of peace,"" he said August 2015. Pope Francis opposed the unjust use of weapons, meaning in his eyes, there can be a just use of weapons. In his 2015 speech to the U.S. Congress, Francis also called for an end to the international arms trade. Hodges might have also reworked fake news that twisted remarks the pope made three years ago in Turin, Italy, in 2015, when he was at a rally of thousands of young people. The pope was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry. ""People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn’t it?"" he said, as reported by Reuters. In the minds of some, that translated into the pope saying that gun owners can’t be Christians. We rated that interpretation Pants on Fire. An online program said Pope Francis had called for worldwide gun confiscation, except for the United Nations. The pope has not said those words or called for such a change. The most generous reading is that this is based on interpretations of remarks the Pope has made about regional and ethnic conflicts. In keeping with Christian doctrine, one would expect the pope to speak against violence. What is striking is even with that, the pope said that there can be just uses of weapons. We shoot down another bit of fake news and rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C23DE40>],/factchecks/2018/jun/20/common-sense-news/fake-news-says-pope-called-world-wide-gun-confisca/

Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mike McCabe says state's internet speed is almost dead last
","Is your internet really as slow as you think it is? Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike McCabe claims Wisconsin ranks 49th in the country for internet speed. ""How are we going to compete in a 21st century economy, and how are people gonna fully participate in modern American life if we’re 49th in the country for internet speed?"" McCabe said in an April 18, 2018, edition of the NewsTalk podcast. McCabe is one 10 Democrats seeking to take on Gov. Scott Walker in the 2018  election. McCabe, a political activist, is running on a platform of ""principle over party."" While we were waiting for the latest cat video to buffer, we decided to check out his claim. A look at the numbers When asked for backup, McCabe pointed to a 2016 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article which cited a study that ranked Wisconsin as 49th for fixed broadband internet speed. Fixed broadband  encompasses landlines, desktops and laptops -- basically everything except mobile connections. So, McCabe made a broad statement about internet speed, but cited data that looks at only part of the picture -- and ignores a major chunk of internet use. To be sure, the 2016 Speedtest ranking McCabe cited did rank Wisconsin 49th, with a speed of 28.59 megabits per second, when it comes to just broadband speed. But if you look just at mobile, Wisconsin ranked much higher, at 15th place. The study did not include an average of broadband and mobile, but more recent data from Akamai’s 2017 State of the Internet Report, issued in the first quarter of 2017, did combine data from both. That ranking placed Wisconsin 30th for average overall internet speed. We asked University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications professor emeritus Barry Orton about McCabe’s claim. He said all data on the subject is a bit fuzzy, but said Wisconsin traditionally does not do as well as other states in terms of average speed. ""Traditionally, WI has been ranked very low compared to other states, primarily because there are so many rural areas in Wisconsin with almost no internet service,"" Orton said. Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg said Walker has done extensive work to boost and strengthen Wisconsin’s broadband system, including creating a $7.68 million dollar grant, the largest in state history, to support broadband expansion.   According to Altenburg this grant will provide 1,600 business locations and 18,000 residential locations with high-speed internet. When we told McCabe what we found, he promised to adjust his claim in the future. He said his main point was that Wisconsin’s goal should be to have high-speed internet access everywhere. Our rating McCabe claimed that Wisconsin ranks 49th in internet speed. A 2016 ranking put Wisconsin at 49th-slowest for broadband internet speed -- that is, for land-based internet, but that only provides a partial picture. When mobile is factored in, the state ranks much higher, in the neighborhood of 30th place.

Fact-checking Democratic attack on Kevin Cramer's statements on Social Security and Medicare
","Kevin Cramer, a Republican congressman from North Dakota running for U.S. Senate, voted in favor of the Republican tax plan that President Donald Trump signed into law — and Democrats are using its cost as political ammunition. ""Kevin Cramer’s vote increases the deficit by $1.9 trillion,"" the voiceover on a Cramer attack ad running in North Dakota says. ""And now, Cramer says, they’ll have to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for it."" The CBO estimated the law increases the deficit by $1.3 trillion over 10 years. When the cost of paying interest on the debt is added, the increase comes to $1.9 trillion. Did Cramer claim he would cut Social Security and Medicare in order to fund the tax plan? His words were not so clear cut. The Senate Majority PAC pointed to two interviews with Cramer two days before Trump signed the tax cuts into law. A caller asked Cramer the following question on the Rob Report on Dec. 20, 2017: ""It looks like the tax bill could result in a debt increase that could lead to cuts in Medicare and Social Security. Congressman Cramer, can you commit today to not cutting Social Security or Medicare in the future? Yes or no?"" Cramer responded, ""Well, the two are not related at all. That’s been one of the scarier tactics of—"" ""Well,"" the caller pressed, ""if we have debt increase, they might rationalize that we have to cut Medicare and Social Security."" Cramer said the tax law would spur the economy and that the deficit was already an issue, but he added that reform to the social safety net was also necessary. ""We need to reform all of our programs, not just to make sure people keep them but to make sure they can be kept for the long haul because both Medicare and Social Security, as you talked about, are on a path to insolvency,"" Cramer said. ""So we need to shore up both of them, not to cut them, we need to shore them up for the long haul."" Steve Ellis, Taxpayers for Common Sense vice president, said Cramer has a point. ""With or without the revenue loss from the tax law, the major entitlement programs were on an unsustainable trajectory,"" Ellis said. ""Changes or ‘cuts’ to Medicare and Social Security are not simply because of a $1.9 trillion deficit increase, which would ‘only’ be roughly $200 billion a year, when we’re looking at a total deficit of $800 billion this year and $1 trillion annual deficits soon."" This is a point Cramer has been making for years, before the tax law. ""Social Security ought to be preserved and made available as promised to seniors and soon-to-be seniors who have paid in with an expectation of receiving benefits,"" Cramer told the political website On the Issues on Oct. 30, 2012. ""We should implement a program to reform and save it for future generations. Included in the reforms should be means testing, raising retirement age and allowing workers to invest more of their own money."" Cramer offered a slightly more clear plan for reform in order to make Medicare and Social Security more sustainable in another interview on Dec. 19, 2018, on Valley News Live’s ""Point of View."" ""Are you on board with this for entitlement reform in 2018? And if so, how specifically?"" host Chris Berg asked. ""Well, we have to get after entitlement reform, Chris, because that’s the only way to get to the debt and deficit,"" Cramer said. ""Over two-thirds of our budget is entitlements. If we don't deal with that, not only do we not deal with the debt if we don’t deal with it, but the entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are going to go broke. We can’t let them just go broke—"" ""For clarity, sir, and again just for time’s sake, you’re saying, ‘Hey, yes, Chris, we do need to start doing reform, Social Security and Medicare,"" Berg asked. ""The first thing is we can’t do any harm to anybody that’s currently on those programs or near getting on those programs,"" Cramer said. ""But for younger people I think we need to design programs, you know expand those programs, maybe do a little more means testing, maybe increase the age by a month or two for a while. The people at the 25-year-old generation might have a little different program than the people that are 75 today."" Cramer suggests vague changes to the way age and need for government assistance is determined, both of which Chris Hayden, spokesman for the Senate Majority PAC, told us qualify as ""cuts"" to Medicare and Social Security. Vanessa Williamson, a governance fellow at Brookings with a focus on taxation, agreed with Hayden’s characterization. ""It seems clear to me that from these remarks that Mr. Cramer is calling for benefit cuts, both by means testing the programs (i.e. reducing or eliminating benefits for non-poor people) and by increasing the age at which you qualify,"" Williamson said. Other experts said the phrasing gave Cramer more leeway. Ellis said the word ""cut"" could be interpreted as an elimination, which Cramer did not suggest. But anything that reduces the cost of a program could be considered a cut, too, including improvements that bring about efficiency. Annette Nellen, professor and director of the Master of Science in Taxation program at San Jose University, said retirees might interpret ""cut"" to be something that affects their monthly checks and non-retirees interpret it to mean less benefits when they retire, or doing so at a later age. Cramer’s comments would not affect current retirees or people nearing retirement. The Senate Majority PAC said, ""And now, Cramer says, they’ll have to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for (tax cuts)."" Cramer said reform was necessary in order to make Medicare and Social Security solvent. Recently, he broadly suggested raising the eligibility age by ""a month or two"" and increasing means testing. Experts said they could be interpreted as calls for cuts. But they don’t affect retirees or people nearing retirement, and were not accompanied by any concrete policy proposals. Also, the Democrats linked his position to the tax bill, but he has held that position for years.

"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Matt  Schlapp']","
No, Donald Trump’s separation of immigrant families was not Barack Obama’s policy
","Critics of the Trump administration’s separating of families illegally crossing the U.S. border with Mexico have characterized the practice as a distinctly cruel feature of Donald Trump’s presidency. But some Republican commentators argue the policy is essentially a continuation of previous administrations. ""You know what's ironic? It's the same way Barack Obama did it,"" conservative commentator Matt Schlapp said during the June 15 broadcast of Fox News' America's Newsroom. ""This is the problem with all of these things, the outrage you see coming from the left. There wasn't outrage over Barack Obama separating kids from adults."" While the Obama administration's immigration approach was not without controversy, it’s simply untrue to say he had a policy of separating families. Let’s recap what the Trump administration is doing, before turning to Obama’s handling of immigration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution. A good number of these people are adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. Instead, kids are placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter until they can be released to a legal guardian. Some 2,000 children have been separated from the adults they were traveling with across the U.S. border, according to the latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security. The children were separated from 1,940 adults from April 19 through May 31 as a result of border-crossing prosecutions. Immigration experts we spoke to said Obama-era policies did lead to some family separations, but only relatively rarely, and nowhere near the rate of the Trump administration. (A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said the Obama administration did not count the number of families separated at the border.) ""Obama generally refrained from prosecution in cases involving adults who crossed the border with their kids,"" said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. ""In contrast, the current administration has chosen to prosecute adult border-crossers, even when they have kids. That's a choice — one fundamentally different from the choice made by both Obama and previous presidents of both parties."" Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said immigration attorneys ""occasionally"" saw separated families under the Obama administration. ""However, these families were usually reunited quite quickly once identified,"" she said, ""even if that meant release of a parent from adult detention."" In Trump’s case, family separations are a feature, not a bug, of the administration’s border policies, said David Fitzgerald, who co-directs the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies. ""The family separations are not the small-scale collateral consequences of a border policy, but rather, a deliberate initiative,"" he added. Former Obama officials in recent interviews drew sharp distinctions between Trump’s policy and that of his predecessors. The Trump administration's current approach is modeled after Operation Streamline, a 2005 program under the administration of George W. Bush, according to Obama spokesman Eric Schultz. The key difference, he said, is that while the 2005 program referred all illegal immigrants for prosecution, it made exceptions for adults traveling with children. Jeh Johnson, Obama’s Homeland Security secretary from 2013 to the end of his presidency, said such separations occurred in rare cases, but never as a matter of policy. ""I can't say that it never happened. There may have been some exigent situation, some emergency,"" Johnson told NPR June 9. ""There may have been some doubt about whether the adult accompanying the child was in fact the parent of the child. I can't say it never happened — but not as a matter of policy or practice. It's not something that I could ask our Border Patrol or our immigration enforcement personnel to do."" Obama’s top domestic policy adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, said the Obama administration briefly weighed the separation of parents from children, before deciding against it. ""I do remember looking at each other like, ‘We’re not going to do this, are we?’ We spent five minutes thinking it through and concluded that it was a bad idea,"" she told the New York Times. ""The morality of it was clear — that’s not who we are."" Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said that, as a deterrent, the Obama administration began prosecuting border-crossers who had already been deported at least once. ""But very few of those people crossed with children, so it didn’t become as visible an issue,"" he said. ""There was some child separation and some pushback by immigrant advocacy groups around that, but the numbers were quite limited. ""The idea of prosecuting people who cross the border illegally the first time they are caught is entirely new,"" he added. ""So we haven’t seen children separated from their parents on anything near this scale before."" The Obama administration’s immigration policy was not without controversy, to be sure. In 2014, amid an influx of asylum seekers from Central America, the administration established large family detention centers to hold parents and children — potentially indefinitely — as a means of deterring other asylees. The practice eventually lost a legal challenge, resulting in a 2016 decision that stopped families from being detained together. Schlapp told us that his claim referred to the fact that both Obama and Trump are bound by the same procedures prohibiting family detention. However, Schlapp’s full comment gives the misleading impression that Trump is essentially continuing Obama’s policy, when in fact Trump’s zero tolerance policy is quite different.   Schlapp said the Trump administration’s policy of separating families is ""the same way Barack Obama did it."" Obama’s immigration policy specifically sought to avoid breaking up families. While some children were separated from their parents under Obama, this was relatively rare, and occurred at a far lower rate than under Trump, where the practice flows from a zero tolerance approach to illegal border-crossings. We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C23D140>],/factchecks/2018/jun/19/matt-schlapp/no-donald-trumps-separation-immigrant-families-was/

Ted Cruz says child-parent separations at border tied to a court order
","Ted Cruz said a court order prevents children from staying with immigrating parents who are jailed at the U.S.-Mexico border. A reader asked us if that’s so. Cruz, the Texas Republican seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2018, said in an interview aired June 11, 2018, that when Barack Obama was president, families entering the country were able to stay together because adults were released rather than detained. For longer than that, immigrants entering the country illegally as families were rarely criminally prosecuted, and many parents and children were placed in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported. Of late, though, the government has cracked down on parents and children attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission. In April 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Homeland Security would refer all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Parents faced with criminal charges would go to detention centers, leaving their newly unaccompanied children to be managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services. On ""Think,"" a public-affairs program produced at Dallas-based KERA radio, Cruz said: ""You know, you think about it, when someone gets arrested for a crime -- let’s say an American citizen gets arrested for a crime, for murder, for burglary, for whatever — if you’re arrested for a crime, you’re separated from your children, you’re put in prison. If you’re the only caregiver for that child, then you’ve got to find alternative care for those children. That is often another family member or, if need be, it’s a foster family or some other means to care for kids. That is the inevitable consequence of somebody being arrested for a crime. ""This is an issue that, I think, the media has largely constructed because what’s shifted is that the (President Donald) Trump administration is endeavoring if people cross illegally to arrest them, not to let them go--and so if they have kids, you know, there is actually a court order that prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail."" A 1997 agreement We sought detail about the described order; Maria Jeffrey in Cruz’s Senate office told us by email that Cruz was referring to a 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department. We didn’t spot language in the January 1997 agreement in Flores v. Reno that explicitly bars children from staying with parents who have been detained or jailed. (See our summary of the agreement here.) There’s no such provision in the agreement, immigration lawyers told us. ""Absolutely not,"" Denise Gilman, who heads an immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said by email, a conclusion also aired by Peter Schey of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights, which was involved in the litigation that led to the agreement. Muzaffar Chishti, a New York lawyer for the Migration Policy Institute, called Cruz’s claim an ""inverse interpretation"" of the Flores agreement. ""He’s basically saying a court order that mandates protecting children is the one that says you must separate families,"" Chishti said by phone. Put another way, Rick Su of the University of Buffalo School of Law said by email that the Flores agreement can be read as barring children from jail, but Su said it doesn’t condone or require the separation of children from parents. ‘Least restrictive setting’ We read the agreement, which says it sets out national policy for the detention, release and treatment of minors in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the government agency overseeing immigration matters before Congress after 9/11 reorganized and renamed departments under the new Department of Homeland Security. ""The INS,"" the agreement states, ""shall place each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special needs"" provided the minor is poised to make timely appearances before immigration authorities and her or his well-being is protected. We noticed, too, that the agreement stresses keeping children close to parents and extended family. For instance, it says INS facilities will provide ""contact with family members who were arrested with the minor"" and segregate unaccompanied minors from unrelated adults. Also, the agreement says, where the INS finds the detention of a minor isn’t required to secure his or her timely appearance, it shall release the minor ""without unnecessary delay."" The minor, the agreement says, should be released, in order of preference, to a parent, a legal guardian, an adult relative or an adult individual or entity designated by the parent or legal guardian or parent. Subsequent choices, the agreement says, extend to licensed programs or, ultimately, another adult or entity seeking custody as an alternative to long-term custody and when ""family reunification does not appear to be a reasonable possibility."" Instructions to INS ""service officers"" in the agreement include a section titled ""family reunification,"" which says: ""Upon taking a minor into custody, the INS, or the licensed program in which the minor is placed, will promptly attempt to reunite the minor with his or her family to permit the release of the minor"" in accord with the agreement’s order-of-preference list. ""Such efforts at family reunification,"" the instructions say, ""will continue so long as the minor is in INS or licensed program custody."" Additional interpretation We asked Cruz’s aide to point out the part of the agreement requiring the separation of children from parents. By email, Jeffrey noted the mandate that minors be placed in the ""least restrictive"" setting and the section about minors being released to family members if possible. Jeffrey further pointed out that the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 held that the Flores agreement applies to all minors, not just those traveling unaccompanied. In that dispute, over the Obama administration placing children with their parents in family detention centers, the appeals court upheld a lower court’s refusal to amend the Flores agreement to accommodate family detention--after which, Su told us, the Obama administration chose to simply release such parents and children. Jeffrey wrote that Cruz’s ""point is simple and 100% correct: When the parents are detained, the Flores agreement compels placing the child with another family member or in another less restrictive setting."" Su alerted us to another arguably influential factor; a 2008 law requires immigration officials holding a minor to transfer the minor to the care of HHS within 72 hours ""after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien child,"" the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 states. Government has options Gilman said Cruz’s claim misleads in part by suggesting parents are getting shuttled into criminal jails and then children, newly unaccompanied, quickly must be handed off to the refugee resettlement office. What actually happens, Gilman wrote, is that parents and children are detained in a border facility and children are taken from parents while the family is at the facility, before criminal charges are brought. Next, Gilman wrote, children are taken into custody and away from the facility by refugee resettlement staff. Only then, Gilman said, are the parents criminally prosecuted before being given a sentence of time served, ""which really is just the time spent at the border facility,"" Gilman said. Next, Gilman said, parents are returned to the border facility ""but the child is already gone."" At that point, the parents are typically sent to an adult immigration detention facility to spend several months--even if they’re successful in passing an asylum screening interview and getting released on bond, Gilman wrote. Su called Cruz’s claim technically correct but misleading in that it leaves the inaccurate impression that the government, by policy and law, has no choice but to separate children from parents. ""The Trump administration’s hands were not forced,"" Su wrote. ""There are multiple ways that separation could be avoided and the nation's interest in immigration adjudication and removal could still be maintained. But the ‘zero tolerance’ policy of detaining and criminally prosecuting all immigrants, even those who arrived with children, is what has led to this."" Summing up, Su said the 2008 law, Flores agreement and court rulings effectively bar the government from sending a detained parent and child to an adult prison together. By policy, Su said, the Trump administration made clear it wasn’t in favor of releasing parents and children--which left it with the options of sending parents to prison and releasing children or sending parents to prison and sending children to child detention facilities overseen by the government. Su said Cruz’s claim, intimating the government has had no choice but to separate children from parents, also overlooks the government’s power to release children to other family members or guardians or even to expand family detention centers so long as they fulfill the agreement’s ""least restrictive setting"" requirement.   ""So yes,"" Su said, ""Cruz is right that once you have make the decision to send the parents to jail, separation may be necessary because Flores generally forbids the government from detaining children in jail,"" Su wrote. ""Although given the horrors of separation, and the rumors of children not being reunited with their parents even after removal,"" Su said, ""it may be that keeping parents and children together in jail would be the ‘least restrictive setting’ if the other option is separation. It is important to note that, from my reading, neither the Flores settlement nor the litigants and judge involved foresaw that the settlement would lead to separation of parents of children,"" Su said.   Our ruling Cruz said a court order ""prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail."" There’s an element of truth to Cruz’s interpretation of the 1997 Flores agreement requiring children to be released or placed in least restrictive settings. As he said, children can’t be jailed with their parents. But that’s true in any situation in which a parent is sent to jail. However, the agreement doesn't mandate the separations occurring on the border, which have stepped up due to a Trump administration change in enforcement policy. If anything, the agreement focuses on ways to protect immigrant children and to reunite them with their families. We rate this claim Mostly False.
