Texas energy company accidentally billed customers more than $200K
","Amid freezing temperatures, households across Texas were urged to conserve energy as ice and snow storms debilitated the state’s power grid, leaving many without power or heat. Reports of high energy bills followed. A screenshot of a tweet spreading across social media shows one CenterPoint Energy customer in Texas was billed $202,102.16.  ""My friend just got this @CNPalerts bill,"" the tweet says. ""Texas deregulated energy is amazing."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ve seen similar posts on TikTok, too, so we looked into it. The image of the bill is authentic.

Facebook post misleads about tax bill breakdown
","A social media post that has been shared thousands of times claims to have a revealing handle on how the government spends American tax dollars. ""So, you say you hate socialism?"" the post begins. ""If you make $50,000/year, $36 of your taxes goes to food stamps. $4,000 goes to corporate subsidies. If the $36 upsets you more than the $4,000, then you just hate poor people — not socialism."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Is this breakdown of how taxpayer money is spent accurate? PolitiFact consulted experts, and it’s not that simple. The food stamp portion of the claim appears to date back to a July 2012 article that broke down how much a married person who made $50,000 a year and who had one child would pay in federal taxes.  After taking into account tax dollars allocated to Medicare and Social Security, the individual’s remaining tax dollars were split among ""programs administrated by the federal government,"" according to the article, which provided a White House website as its evidence.  The author of the article concluded that $36.82 of the hypothetical individual’s tax bill went toward funding ""food and nutrition assistance."" That category presumably refers to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan, which replaced the Food Stamp Act of 1997 back in 2008. The calculations were based on numbers from years ago. Since then, federal spending on programs has changed and so have federal income tax brackets, meaning these numbers are outdated. The article doesn’t touch on ""corporate subsidies"" at all, nor is there a line for them on the 2013 White House Federal Taxpayer Receipt, which sought to break down how individuals’ taxes are spent by the government. PolitiFact was unable to find a source for the claim that $4,000 worth of taxes paid by a person earning $50,000 would fund ""corporate subsidies."" Experts say analyzing this claim isn’t easy because the post lacks necessary details.  Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said the post is missing critical information needed to make an accurate comparison — including whether federal and state taxes are being considered.  Beyond that, he pointed out the post also doesn’t specify ""what kind of family you’re talking about, whether ‘food stamps’ includes both the direct cost and the administrative cost, and above all what ‘corporate subsidies’ means.""  For example, he said, a married couple with two children ""could very easily owe zero federal income taxes"" at a yearly income of $50,000. ""It’s virtually impossible to fact-check,"" Gardner said. ""It’s just too vague."" Richard Winchester, tax policy expert and law professor at Seton Hall Law School, said the claim made an ""unusual comparison"" and noted that the post ""oversimplifies and misleads."" First, Winchester said it was unclear what would be considered a ""corporate subsidy,"" per the post’s claim. He said it was possible the post was referring to tax expenditures — also known as revenue ""the government is passing up by not taxing"" certain things. But Winchester pointed out that it’s not as if a person’s tax money would ""go to"" corporate tax expenditures the way the post claims.  ""It’s one thing to say, ‘alright, the federal government actually writes a check [...] to fund SNAP,’"" Winchester said. ""But corporate tax expenditures — it’s not writing a check. It’s really forgoing revenue. Winchester said it was also possible that the ""corporate subsidies"" in the post referred to money the government gives directly to some businesses, but it’s simply not clear.  Neil Buchanan is a law professor at the University of Florida’s Levin College of Law and an expert on tax policy. He echoed the concern that there’s no single definition of corporate subsidy. ""Is the entire Pentagon budget a corporate subsidy?"" he said. ""Is the CDC's budget a corporate subsidy, because businesses benefit from the research that CDC produces? Again, that term means nothing.""  Further, Buchanan said ""there are so many moving parts to the budget picture that it's possible to cherry-pick numbers to present almost any picture you want,"" with these types of claims. Even taking into account the lack of information, Buchanan concluded there was no possible way that the post could be making an accurate claim: ""The highest amount in federal income taxes that a person with $50,000 in gross income in 2020 would pay is $4,314, and he would pay $3,825 in payroll taxes, for a total of $8,139. Social Security, Medicare, interest on the national debt, and military spending combine for 72% of spending, so if we (meaninglessly) multiply that by our $50,000 earner's federal tax total, that is $5,860, leaving only $2,279 for everything else. How would we get $4,000 for corporate subsidies out of $2,279?"" Gardner said there might be a ""kernel of truth"" to the post in that the U.S. spends more on corporate subsidies than on SNAP benefits.  But, he also used a hypothetical situation with the ""most aggressive scenario possible in terms of federal income tax — a single person, all wages, no itemized deductions, no kids"" and estimated the person’s total tax bill would be about $4,100.  This would mean that after SNAP benefits and ""corporate subsidies"" were taken out of that tax bill, there would be just $64 left for other federal programs. ""Since we obviously fund a lot of things other than food stamps and corporate subsidies, the dollar value of those numbers seems clearly wrong,"" Gardner concluded. A post claims, ""If you make $50,000/year, $36 of your taxes goes to food stamps. $4,000 goes to corporate subsidies."" Experts say the post does not provide enough information to break down if a person’s tax dollars are being spent in this way. However, even when experts considered the most extreme hypothetical tax situations, they concluded these numbers were not possible.

Beto O’Rourke said Texas was warned for years about power grid
","The massive power outage in Texas that left millions with no heat amid frigid temperatures should have come as no surprise, according to former El Paso Congressman Beto O’Rourke. ""Texans are suffering without power because those in power have failed us,"" said O’Rourke in a Twitter thread, calling out Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. ""State leaders don’t get to say that they didn’t see this coming. Energy experts and State House Dems, among others, were warning of this for years. Abbott chose to ignore the facts, the science and the tough decisions and now Texans will once again pay the price,"" tweeted O’Rourke, a 2019 Democratic presidential candidate. We found that O’Rourke spoke accurately — there had been years of warnings by energy experts about the state’s power system following cold weather in February 2011, when around 200 generating units faltered, causing power outages for 3.2 million customers, according to a post-mortem of that crisis.  In August 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corp., wrote a 357-page report about the February 2011 outage.  The report stated that in 1989, after cold weather caused many generators to fail, the Public Utility Commission of Texas issued a number of recommendations aimed at improving winterization of the generators. However, ""these recommendations were not mandatory, and over the course of time implementation lapsed. Many of the generators that experienced outages in 1989 failed again in 2011,"" the report stated. The report found that in 2011 ""the generators did not adequately anticipate the full impact of the extended cold weather and high winds."" More thorough preparation for cold weather could have prevented many of the weather-related outages, the report found. There are a lot of similarities between the deficiencies in the grid cited in the 2011 report and those now, said Dave Tuttle, an Energy Institute research associate at the University of Texas at Austin, in an interview with the Austin American-Statesman. Following the 2011 blackout, state legislators held a hearing where senators expressed surprise that Texas had outages when other areas of the country are able to keep power on during cold weather.  O’Rourke told us in a text message that one of the people who warned about the problems was Sylvester Turner, who was a state representative in 2011 and is now Houston’s mayor. Turner, a Democrat, authored HB 1986, which called for the Public Utility Commission to ensure the Electric Reliability Council of Texas had adequate reserve power to prevent blackout conditions. ERCOT manages about 90% of the state’s electric load. ""Ironically that bill that I filed was not heard in committee,"" Turner said this week on CNN. In 2011, the Legislature did pass a bill to require power companies to submit reports to the Public Utility Commission about weatherization efforts. The author of that bill, Republican Glenn Hegar, who is now the state comptroller, questions whether the bill went far enough, according to a recent report in the Houston Chronicle.  ""I am extremely frustrated that 10 years later our electric grid remains so ill-equipped for these weather events,"" Hegar said. The Texas House Democratic caucus cited some other bills that were intended at least in part to improve the state’s energy infrastructure that failed to pass or remain pending. Some bills pertain directly to the Public Utility Commission, which has oversight of ERCOT. One bill included a proposal to elect a member of the commission while another would have required state agencies to create strategic plans to account for expected changes in weather. A separate bill called for creating an agreement between ERCOT and an adjacent Mexican power grid for cross-border dispatch. This session, a legislator filed a bill to study the impacts of climate change. One of the key experts who has raised concerns for years about ERCOT is Ed Hirs, a lecturer of energy economics at the University of Houston. Following the 2011 mass outage, ""there were lots of reports and recommendations and lots of people waving their hands,"" but no substantial changes, Hirs told us.  Hirs sent us articles in which he raised alarms about Texas’ power setup dating back to 2013,   when he wrote that the state had a Soviet-style model that allowed ERCOT to essentially set prices across the state.  ""ERCOT's problem with the model has been made evident in the rolling blackouts across Texas over the past several years,"" Hirs wrote in a 2013 Houston Chronicle op-ed with co-author Paul MacAvoy, an energy expert and Yale University professor emeritus. ""A recent letter from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation to ERCOT warns that projected near-future generating capacity is insufficient to meet growth in demand and points to the likelihood of significant shortfalls in electricity generation and delivery,"" they wrote. (Here is the letter.) Hirs raised similar alarms about ERCOT and blackouts in 2014 in a Texas Monthly article and in a 2019 op-ed in the Houston Chronicle. ""The Texas electricity market is rife with market manipulation and major disincentives for generators to maintain a reliable supply of power,"" he wrote in 2019. ""The latest examples of this have become public in recent days, a state of affairs that costs Texas consumers real money each year."" We asked spokespersons for Abbott if they had any evidence to refute O’Rourke’s statement about the warnings about the power problems for years. Renae Eze replied that O’Rourke was ""choosing to play politics"" but did not respond directly to our question. Abbott has declared reforming ERCOT a priority for the current legislative session. O’Rourke said regarding the Texas power blackout ""energy experts and State House Dems, among others, were warning of this for years."" Experts have been warning about the failures of the state’s power grid for years, particularly after a 2011 cold spell. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. wrote an extensive report showing that recommendations following a 1989 outage weren’t implemented. Other experts have also warned for years about ERCOT and power blackouts, and state legislators tried to propose bills to improve the state’s energy infrastructure. We rate this claim True.

Trump’s second impeachment did not cost $33 million
","Throughout former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial, some Facebook users speculated that it was a waste of taxpayer money. ""Boy, that 33 Million that was spent on the impeachment sure would help a bunch of small businesses right now…"" said a Feb. 11 text post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Democratic-controlled House introduced the article of impeachment on Jan. 11 and passed it two days later, charging Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol while Congress counted electoral votes. On Feb. 13, after a five-day trial, the Senate acquitted Trump.  Trump was the only president to be impeached twice, and claims about the costs also arose during his previous impeachment in late 2019. At the time, we rated False a claim that the monthslong process — which culminated in an acquittal in January 2020 — cost taxpayers $40 million. So we wanted to look into these posts, too. (Screenshot from Facebook) The Facebook post is wrong — there is no evidence that Trump’s second impeachment trial cost $33 million.  ""It’s hard to pinpoint exactly how much the impeachment cost,"" said Steve Ellis, president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""But I sincerely doubt it was anywhere close to $33 million."" The $33 million figure appears to stem from a report about former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Expenditure filings from May 2017 to 2019 put the cost of Muller’s investigation at around $32 million. However, that number didn’t account for forfeitures made by people ensnared in the probe or the fact that indirect expenses like pay for FBI personnel didn’t cost additional tax dollars. Mueller’s findings were not part of either impeachment. An accurate estimate for Trump’s first impeachment could inform the cost of his second, but concrete numbers are hard to come by. The Congressional Budget Office did not receive a cost estimate for the first impeachment against Trump. A February 2020 bill that called for the Government Accountability Office to conduct an audit of costs associated with the inquiry did not pass the House. A December 2019 report from the House Judiciary Committee that accompanied the articles of impeachment said the resolution ""does not provide new budgetary authority or increased tax expenditures."" ""Additionally, the committee believes that the resolution will have no budget effect,"" the report said. One way that some media outlets and think tanks have tried to estimate the cost of the first impeachment inquiry is to add up the salaries of staffers on the relevant committees. But those aren’t official estimates — and the salaries of congressional staffers aren’t impacted by impeachment. ""The lawmakers and their staff are sunk costs. Taxpayers are paying their salary regardless,"" Ellis said. ""You could argue opportunity cost — what’s not getting done because of impeachment. But there’s no dollar figure on that."" Tax policy experts told PolitiFact there isn’t a concrete estimate for how much Trump’s second impeachment cost taxpayers. But given the fact that it lasted only a few weeks, it probably wasn’t much. ""I’m not aware of any reputable cost estimates on the impeachment trial, and I’m skeptical that an accurate estimate could be made,"" said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. As with Trump’s first impeachment, the CBO does not have a cost estimate associated with the House’s impeachment proceedings. We could not find any other official estimate of the trial’s cost to taxpayers. Putting aside lawmaker salaries, let’s take a look at some of the potential costs of the second impeachment. First up: legal bills. During the first impeachment trial, Trump’s defense team included former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and several personal attorneys, but taxpayers didn’t cover his legal fees. During the second impeachment, Trump did not have White House counsel on his defense team. The House Judiciary Committee announced Jan. 15 that it hired two lawyers ""on a consulting basis"" for the trial. ""That would come out of already appropriated funds to congressional operations,"" Ellis said. Another potential cost is travel expenses for witnesses. During the first impeachment, ambassadors flew to Washington from overseas to testify before Congress. But during Trump’s second impeachment, no witnesses were called. Facebook post says Trump's second impeachment ""cost $33 million."" That’s wrong. There is no concrete estimate for Trump’s second impeachment, which lasted just a few weeks. The $33 million figure appears to be based on an incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the cost of the Mueller investigation, which was not related to either of Trump’s impeachments. The CBO does not have cost estimates for the impeachment resolutions, and the House Judiciary Committee said the first inquiry had no effect on taxpayers. Experts say congressional salaries and other institutional costs are built into the budget. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.

No, the snow isn’t government-generated. This is what a snowball does when you take a lighter to it.
","As strange winter weather brought frigid temperatures and snowfall as far south as Houston, some social media users were claiming that there’s something strange about the snow itself.  A series of videos posted to Facebook show social media users holding snowballs over lighters. To their surprise, the snowballs don’t melt away, but begin to develop black scorch marks.  ""It’s not even melting!"" one user exclaims. ""It’s just turning black!""  The users posit various explanations for this phenomenon: ""fake snow,"" alien technology, a simulated reality, and a massive government conspiracy.  ""Anyone playing with the government-generated snow yet?"" reads a caption on one of the videos.  We took a cold, hard look at these theories, and found that science has a better explanation.  Astronomer and science blogger Phil Plait described it in a Slate article and accompanying video.  Many of the users seem to expect the snowball to melt away from the lighter flame as an ice cube would. However, ice and snow have distinct physical properties, which leads them to react to heat differently.  Snow consists of frozen water droplets that have fallen to Earth. When snow is compressed into snowballs, there’s a lot of space between the crystals, making them soft and porous.  Ice is denser and more rigid, with less space between the frozen water molecules. When an ice cube melts, there’s no space for the water droplets to go, so they end up dripping away.  ""Think of ice like a glass window, where water bounces off, and a snowball like a window screen, where water can get through,"" Plait told PolitiFact.  Here’s what’s happening in the videos: As the lighters heat up the snowballs, some of the snow begins to turn to water. However, that water gets absorbed into the remaining snow, making it seem like the snowball is shrinking in size rather than melting away.  Given enough time, a snowball exposed to heat will melt into a puddle. However, the social media users hold lighters to the snowballs only long enough for black scorch marks to appear.  As for the scorch marks? Those come from the lighters themselves.  Lighters are typically fueled by butane, which is composed of carbon and hydrogen. When a lighter is flicked on, the butane molecules react with the oxygen in the air, releasing energy as heat.  However, Plait explained, the reaction isn’t perfect, and some of the carbon molecules from the butane bond with one another to form soot.  ""When (soot) is made in the videos it plates itself onto the snowball making it turn black,"" he said.  There’s nothing strange or artificial about the snow in the videos. It’s probably best to let these claims melt away.  Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2021/feb/19/facebook-posts/no-snow-isnt-government-generated-what-snowball-do/

No, renewable energy didn't 'thrust' Texas into statewide blackouts
","Wind energy is big business in Texas. Over the past five years, wind has grown from supplying 11% of Texas energy demand to 23% and is now the state’s second-largest resource after natural gas.   But that growth has come despite attempts from some conservative groups to slow its progress, and many of those groups seized the opportunity to criticize the renewable resource after initial reports surfaced that turbines were freezing up due to this week’s historic single-digit temperatures across much of Texas.   Gov. Greg Abbott became one such critic on Tuesday night as millions of Texans were without power and facing another freezing night. The governor appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News show and tied the crisis to the state’s renewable energy resources.   ""Our wind and our solar got shut down and ... that thrust Texas into this situation where it was lacking power at a statewide basis,"" Abbott said during an interview on Hannity. ""As a result, it just shows that fossil fuels are necessary for the state of Texas as well as other states to make sure that we're able to heat our homes in the wintertime and cool our homes in the summertime.""  Similar claims placing blame squarely on wind energy were repeated throughout the day Tuesday by several politicians, a conservative think tank and Fox News’ Tucker Carlson.  But how accurate is it to say that renewable energy’s increasing market share is to blame for thrusting ""Texas into this situation where it was lacking power""?      Abbott’s comments and those of his Republican colleagues directly contradict information reported by the state’s grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.   Throughout the week, operators have stressed that record-low temperatures across the state have impacted all energy sources, from renewables to fossil fuels.  According to ERCOT's Fuel Mix Report, the state’s largest energy source last year was natural gas, which provided 46% of the state’s energy needs. Wind followed as the second-largest with 23%. Coal supplied 18%, nuclear 11% and solar 2%.  Over Valentine’s Day weekend, before grid operators mandated statewide blackouts,  several wind turbines froze due to unusual levels of cold moisture in West Texas’ typically dry air. But as electricity demand spiked to record levels early Monday morning, grid operators said that electric plants of all energy sources ""began tripping offline in rapid succession.""   On Tuesday, as the number of homes without power peaked around 4 million, grid operators said that thermal energy plants were mostly to blame for the ongoing shortfall.  ""There is significantly more megawatts in that thermal unit category than in the renewable category as far as what's out during this particular event at the current time,"" said Dan Woodfin, head of system operations at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.  Around 29,000 megawatts of thermal energy — which is sourced from coal, gas and nuclear plants — were missing from the grid Tuesday.   Texas has 24,000 megawatts of total installed wind capacity spread mostly across West Texas and the Gulf Coast, and over half of that was frozen up this past week.   The Electric Reliability Council of Texas forecasts the state’s full inventory of turbines to generate around 6,200 megawatts of electricity during the month of February due to the season’s typically low winds. However, even though more than half of Texas’ wind resources were frozen up, the storm’s bluster caused the turbines that remained operational — mostly located in the Gulf Coast — to outperform seasonal forecasts. On Tuesday, for instance, the unfrozen turbines collectively produced up to 1,000 megawatts more energy than grid operators expected.   Nonetheless, the grid was in need of any juice the frozen turbines could have otherwise added.  ""If you’re pointing to a few thousand megawatts of wind being short and ignoring the fact that tens of thousands of thermals are short — I don’t see how you can paint that kind of picture,"" said Josh Rhodes, a University of Texas research associate at the Energy Institute.  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas hasn’t yet released information showing how the 29,000 megawatts of missing thermal energy breaks down between the three resources — coal, gas and nuclear.   But grid officials said during news conferences that most of this deficit was due to gas plants.   ""It appears that a lot of the generation that has gone offline today has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system at large,"" Bill Magness, ERCOT CEO, said on Tuesday. ""From getting the gas from the wellheads, through the pipes to generators and to consumers for heating natural gas. That really seems to be a lot of the issues from the plant that we're seeing become unavailable during the day today.""  While freezing temperatures can hamper wind energy by freezing up turbine blades, natural gas plants can be affected in a multitude of ways. Gas wells can freeze up. Uninsulated pipelines can cause gasses with heavy carbon chains to liquify. A plant’s water intake or outtake pipes can freeze.   ""All of those things can impact operations of any type of plant,"" said Bernadette Johnson, an energy economist at Enverus.  ""We're seeing issues with resources across the board. We're seeing outages with gas plants, we're seeing outages with coal plants,"" Johnson said.  On Wednesday, the day after Abbott’s Fox News interview, the governor held a press conference in which he appeared to alter his messaging by saying ""every source of power the state of Texas has access to has been compromised.""  When asked to explain this shift, Abbott said that in over two dozen interviews he has ""repeatedly talked about how every source of power that the state of Texas has, has been compromised.""  Not once during his interview with Hannity did Abbott mention coal, gas or nuclear as reasons behind the outages and blackouts.   One reporter highlighted the disparity in his messaging and pushed the governor to explain the shift.  Reporter: So you’re now saying something totally different than what you said on Hannity? Abbott: Not at all, not at all. Reporter: That’s what you said. Abbott: That’s not what I said. Abbott said that the failure of the state’s renewable energy sources ""thrust Texas into this situation where it was lacking power at a statewide basis.""   Texas is a state with diverse energy sources. Grid officials have said multiple times that, on top of grid infrastructure being poorly designed to handle the week's freezing conditions, the drop in power supply is attributable to all energy sources. Although many wind turbines faltered under the conditions, wind energy as a whole outperformed normal expectations thanks to blustery weather.  Abbott walked back the comments he made on Hannity during a press conference the next day, denying that he singled out wind power as the culprit.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/feb/19/greg-abbott/fact-checking-texas-republicans-blackout-blame/

No, bottled water doesn’t solve all problems for residents with PFAS-contaminated water
","For years, Wisconsin has been grappling with ""forever chemical"" contaminations in some of its towns and cities, making it so residents can’t drink the water from their own wells.  Those chemicals, known as PFAS -- per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances -- have been linked to all kinds of health risks, including types of kidney and testicular cancers, lower birth weights and harm to immune and reproductive systems. PFAS, a large family of man-made chemicals, were once prized for their non-stick characteristics and were used to make non-stick pans, waterproof clothing and other items. They’re also commonly used in fast food wrappers, to keep the grease from leaking out.   The chemicals accumulate in the body over time, meaning the more consumed via food or water, the more is stored in the body.  In Wisconsin, the chemicals have ended up in the soil in many places -- including Marinettte, Peshtigo, Milwaukee and Madison -- due to the use and testing of fire fighting foam used to put out blazes involving gas. In the communities dealing with those contaminations, many residents can no longer drink or cook with the water from their kitchen sink, forcing them to rely on weekly shipments of bottled water, paid for by the polluting party or, in some cases, the state Department of Natural Resources.  Scott Manley, executive vice president for government relations for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobbying group, during a Jan. 31, 2020, interview about the chemicals on WKOW’s ""Capital City Sunday"" said that residents aren’t put at risk by the contamination if they’re getting the bottled water.  ""People who have wells that test for elevated levels of PFAS are currently being provided clean drinking water at the expense of the responsible party, so nobody’s health is at risk right now,"" he said.  That stopped us. Is it true that there is no risk to people within polluted areas if they’re receiving bottled water shipments for drinking and cooking?  Let’s start with some background. One of the most well-known areas where bottled water has to be provided to residents is in Marinette and Peshtigo in northeastern Wisconsin.  The PFAS in that area originated at the Tyco Fire Products firefighting foam testing facility, which saw outdoor testing of foam up until 2017.  The foam was washed into sanitary sewers after testing, allowing PFAS to leach into the ground. The PFAS in the soil at the testing plant later leached out of the boundaries of the testing facility, carried by groundwater, and have been found in private wells across the area.  Tyco, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, is paying to provide bottled water or water treatment systems to residents with PFAS in their wells above a certain level and has set aside money to work towards providing the residents with a water system for all affected in the future, in cooperation with the city of Marinette.  When asked for backup to support Manley’s claim, Nick Novak, vice president of communications and marketing for WMC, essentially repeated what Manley said:  ""Parties responsible for elevated levels of specific PFAS substances have supplied affected communities with bottled water or water filtration systems in the near term while working closely with regulators and community members on long-term potable water solutions to ensure no one’s health or safety is put at risk.""  But environmental groups disagree with the assertion that no one’s health is at risk. And various studies also cite known concerns. Carly Michiels, government relations director for Clean Wisconsin, noted that water is not the only thing affected by PFAS contamination. ""There are also considerations like the contaminated biosolids that have been spread on farm fields, or waterways that have contaminated the fish, which would all impact a person’s public health,"" she said. ""Drinking water out of a tap is only one source of exposure in a large PFAS hotspot.""  Biosolids, or the sludge taken out of waste water treatment systems, is typically spread on farm fields, and PFAS can be found in soil in contaminated areas.  Though not yet conclusive, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is studying how crops can absorb PFAS, which could then be consumed and added to the accumulation of the chemicals in a person’s body.  Studies in Wisconsin have shown that PFAS also accumulate in fish, which has resulted in the DNR issuing warnings about consuming fish from certain areas more than once or twice a month. Fish in ponds in Marinette have shown elevated levels of PFAS, according to an October 2020 report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, as well as fish in Madison lakes and even Lake Superior. Elevated levels of PFAS have also been found in the livers of deer in the Marinette area, prompting the DNR to issue consumption advisories for the organs, according to a September 2020 report in the Journal Sentinel.  So even though residents may have access to clean water via deliveries of bottled water, there is still a risk of consuming contaminated produce, fish or meat from the area, which could contribute to a buildup of PFAS in the body.  Manley claimed that no one’s health is at risk if they’re receiving bottled drinking water due to contamination in their home’s water supply.  While precautions put in place to provide safe drinking water have helped mitigate the problem in the short term, residents can still ingest PFAS through other means, such as meat or fish hunted from nearby land, or possibly even produce harvested from areas where PFAS are present in the soil.  We rate the claim False.  ",/factchecks/2021/feb/19/scott-manley/no-bottled-water-doesnt-solve-all-problems-residen/

Yes, aversion to federal regulation drove Texas to isolate its power grid
","The winter blackouts that have forced millions of Texans to bear freezing temperatures without heat or power have drawn attention to the fact that Texas is the only state in the continental U.S. with its own power grid. What could account for the Texas grid’s unorthodox layout? The answer, according to some social media users, is the state’s aversion to federal regulation.  ""The Texas power grid is not part of the U.S. power grid because they wanted to avoid federal regulation,"" reads a Facebook post.  The continental United States is divided into three grids: an eastern grid, a western grid, and the Texas grid. The Texas grid manages more than 90% of the state’s electric load.   Is it true that a fear of federal regulation drove Texas to isolate its grid from the rest of the country? Here’s a rundown of the evidence.  In 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Federal Power Act, which tasked a regulatory agency called the Federal Power Commission with overseeing electricity sales that crossed state lines. Congress enacted the law in response to market domination and shady business practices by huge utility holding companies during the 1920s and ‘30s.  Texas electric companies and energy authorities immediately sought ways to stave off federal interference under that law. To do so, they elected to keep the power grid entirely within Texas borders, creating an ""electric Alamo,"" in the words of U.S. Circuit Judge Richard D. Cudahy. Since federal regulators had jurisdiction only over interstate sales, the gambit prevented them from subjecting Texas electrical companies to any rules.   Source: ERCOT ""So eager were the Texas utilities to maintain traditional Texas independence that they memorialized the policy of isolation into a written agreement, binding themselves to intrastate operation,"" Cudahy wrote in a 1995 account of an energy-related court battle.  This agreement formed the foundation of the electrical grid that’s still in place today.  Five years after a 1965 blackout shut down much of the Northeast U.S., the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, called ERCOT, was formed to oversee the Texas grid. ERCOT still operates the grid, which is still out of the reach of federal regulators.  Several attempts have been made to integrate the Texas grid into the broader U.S. power system. In 1976, a Texas utility company, hoping to bring the state under federal jurisdiction, allowed power to flow to another one of its properties in Oklahoma for several hours in an event known as the ""Midnight Connection."" The incident set off a fierce legal battle to subject Texas to federal oversight. But the case was decided in ERCOT’s favor, and the grid remained independent from the rest of the system.  ERCOT has since championed its freedom from the rest of the United States in promotional videos. The state’s energy ""independence has been jealously guarded, I think both by policy makers and the industry,"" said Bill Magness, CEO of ERCOT, in one of the videos.  However, the freedom from regulation has also come with disadvantages.  By isolating its grid, Texas has hindered its ability to import power from either the Eastern or Western energy systems, said Carey King, assistant director of the Energy Institute at UT Austin.  ERCOT isn’t completely separate from other U.S. grids, said King. As a result of the Midnight Connection, it has two minor ties to the Eastern grid, which can be used to pipe power in during emergencies. However, this connection isn’t powerful enough to meet demand in the event of a blackout like the one that’s just occurred.  ""The Texas power grid is not part of the U.S. power grid because they wanted to avoid federal regulation,"" reads a Facebook post. The history of the Texas power grid backs this up. An aversion to federal regulation was one of the main reasons that Texas energy companies opted for a power grid that didn’t cross state lines. Texas has resisted regulation in major court cases.  This claim is True. ​",/factchecks/2021/feb/18/facebook-posts/yes-aversion-federal-regulation-drove-texas-isolat/

Joe Biden’s town hall mistake about an inflation-indexed minimum wage
","During a CNN town hall in Wisconsin, Joe Biden misstated an argument in favor of raising the minimum wage. Biden and many other Democrats support a phased-in minimum-wage hike to $15 an hour. That would be a significant increase from the current $7.25, a level that has been steady since 2009.  Biden’s American Rescue Plan includes the wage hike to $15, though it’s unclear whether that provision will be included in the relief legislation now working its way through Congress.  During the town hall, a member of the audience asked Biden about the wage hike proposal, ""Given the lower cost of living specifically in the Midwest, many business owners are concerned that this will put them out of business, forcing them to downsize or cut benefits,"" the audience member said. ""How can you instill confidence in small businesses that this will benefit the Midwest business growth?"" Biden said it was reasonable for small business owners to worry about the impact, but he sought to reassure the questioner that the positive impacts would outweigh the negative ones if the change was made gradually. ""Here’s the deal,"" Biden said. ""It’s about doing it gradually, where it’s (currently) $7.25 an hour. No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty. But it’s totally legitimate for small business owners to be concerned about how that changes.  ""If we kept (the minimum wage) indexed to inflation, people would be making $20 an hour right now,"" Biden said. ""That’s what it would be."" But Biden muffed his talking point.  Using the inflation calculator operated by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, $7.25 in 2009 would be worth about $8.98 in 2021, which is well short of $20.  Even if you indexed the minimum wage that had the most purchasing power in history — $1.60 in 1968 — the inflation-adjusted value today would be $12.27, and that’s still short of $20. The White House said Biden should have referenced a different method of equalizing the minimum wage across time — if the minimum wage had been indexed for worker productivity, rather than inflation. The White House cited a specific blog post from 2020 by Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. In the post, Baker wrote that until 1968, the minimum wage did roughly increase in tandem with worker productivity increases. This pattern, he said, broke down after 1968, with worker productivity consistently rising but the value of the minimum wage declining. ""The distinction between inflation and productivity is an important one,"" Baker wrote. ""If the minimum wage rises in step with inflation, we are effectively ensuring that it will allow minimum wage earners to buy the same amount of goods and services through time, protecting them against higher prices. However, if it rises with productivity, that means that, as workers are able to produce more goods and services per hour on average, minimum wage earners will be able to buy more goods and services through time."" In the post, Baker calculated that if the minimum wage had risen in step with productivity growth since 1968, ""it would be over $24 an hour today."" Baker told PolitiFact that ""the inflation adjustment can be calculated in different ways, but I can't see any way you get to $20 an hour in 2021."" Biden said that ""if we kept (the minimum wage) indexed to inflation, people would be making $20 an hour right now."" Indexing the minimum wage to inflation would have produced a wage today between $8.98 and $12.27, depending on which year you started the indexing. That’s well short of the $20 Biden said.  The White House said Biden should have said that if the minimum wage had been indexed to worker productivity, it would be at $20 an hour today. That’s close to the $24 estimated by a liberal economist, but that’s not what Biden said.  We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2021/feb/18/joe-biden/joe-bidens-town-hall-mistake-about-inflation-index/

Despite Collins’ claim, Loeffler has donated much more to Republicans than Dems
","In a special Senate election that features two prominent Georgia Republicans, Rep. Doug Collins claimed in a tweet that Sen. Kelly Loeffler has a ""long history of donating to abortion-on-demand Democrats."" Collins has a point. Over a period of years, Loeffler has made campaign contributions to Democrats who support abortion rights.  But the vast majority of her campaign cash has been given to Republicans, and she has been endorsed by major anti-abortion groups. Their race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.  The special election — open to candidates from all parties, including the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the leading Democratic candidate — is being held to fill the seat held by Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned in December with health problems. Loeffler was appointed to the seat on an interim basis.  Georgia is unique in this cycle in that both of its Senate seats are being contested on Nov. 3. If none of the 21 candidates in the special election gets at least 50% of the vote, a runoff election will be held Jan. 5.  Georgia’s other Senate contest pits Republican incumbent David Perdue against Democrat Jon Ossoff. To some, the term ""abortion on demand"" might suggest abortion at any time under any circumstances; but the common definition is much different.  Collins’ campaign cited three dictionary definitions of abortion on demand. Each says:  ""The right of a woman to have an abortion during the first six months of a pregnancy. ""An abortion performed on a woman solely at her own request."" To back Collins’ claim, his campaign cited campaign contributions Loeffler made herself as well as contributions from the political action committee of the company Intercontinental Exchange, where her husband, Jeff Sprecher, is CEO. ICE is the publicly traded parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. Collins’ campaign cited Federal Election Commission records showing a total of $13,100 in donations made by Loeffler nine or more years ago — from 2006 to 2011 — to congressional campaigns for six Democrats, all of whom support abortion rights.  We found that each of the Democrats had received high ratings from NARAL (formerly the National Abortion Rights Action League) Pro-Choice America. John Barrow, a former Georgia representative ($500) Chris Dodd, former Connecticut senator ($2,000) Bob Etheridge, a former North Carolina representative ($500, $2,300) Former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin ($2,000) Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan ($2,000 Rep. David Scott of Georgia ($2,300, $1,500) Collins also cited $69,000 in donations made from 2011 to 2019, but not by Loeffler herself. They were made by the political action committee for her husband’s company, Intercontinental Exchange, to five Democrats who support abortion rights.  Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York ($14,000) Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York ($10,000) Allyson Schwartz, a former Pennsylvania representative ($2,500) Stabenow ($22,500) Rep. Maxine Waters of California ($20,000) There is no indication, however, that these donations were made because of the individual lawmakers’ stances on abortion.  Loeffler’s campaign responded by claiming that nearly 99% of nearly $2 million in political contributions made by Loeffler have gone to anti-abortion candidates.  The data does indicate the vast majority of Loeffler’s contributions have been to Republicans: Since 2006, of the more than $2 million in political contributions made by Loeffler, $16,600 has gone to Democrats or liberal causes, according to data the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics provided PolitiFact. Of the $3.2 million Loeffler and her husband have given to political committees, less than 3% went to Democratic candidates and causes, the center reported in December. Moreover, Loeffler can point to anti-abortion credentials. Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in December chose Loeffler over Collins, who had been recommended by President Donald Trump, to replace Isakson. Kemp said Loeffler would ""defend life against the radical left's abortion-on-demand agenda."" Loeffler also has been endorsed in the special election by the National Right to Life Committee and other anti-abortion groups. Collins claimed his fellow Republican Loeffler has a ""long history of donating to abortion-on-demand Democrats."" From 2006 to 2011, Loeffler personally gave a total of $13,100 in campaign donations to six Democrats who support abortion rights. The political action committee of her husband’s company has also donated to a handful of Democrats more recently, but these contributions did not come from Loeffler. Overall, only a tiny fraction of the campaign contributions made by Loeffler have gone to Democrats, and she has won endorsements from major anti-abortion groups.

Donald Trump Jr. misrepresents Joe Biden’s tax plan
","Donald Trump Jr. claimed in a widespread tweet that former Vice President Joe Biden ""wants to raise taxes on 82% of all Americans."" The eldest son of President Donald Trump was repeating a refrain from the Republican National Convention, where Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and Eric Trump made similar claims. But the claim is misleading.  Joe Biden wants to raise taxes on 82% of all Americans. Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, has pledged not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 per year, as we’ve reported. Independent tax analysts have found that his plan does not call for direct tax increases on anyone below that threshold. Tax analysts say the indirect effects of Biden’s proposal to raise the corporate tax rate could mean slightly lower after-tax incomes for some lower earners. By one analysis, about 82% of Americans would feel these effects — though for many, the hit would be small.  But that doesn’t mean 82% of Americans will have higher tax rates or owe more to the Internal Revenue Service, as the phrase ""raise taxes"" suggests.  ""To the extent that the Trump campaign is using this figure to imply that individual income and payroll taxes will rise for 82% of Americans, the claim is misleading,"" said John Ricco, a senior analyst at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which is the basis for the 82% figure. Biden’s tax plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. It would do so in part by rolling back some of the tax cuts for corporations and people with taxable incomes over $400,000 that Trump signed into law in 2017. Among Biden’s proposed changes, he would: Increase the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Raise the top federal marginal income tax rate for individuals to 39.6%. Place a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on incomes above $400,000. Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. Other independent groups have also examined Biden’s tax plan, including the Tax Foundation, the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the American Enterprise Institute and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The groups have generally agreed that Biden’s plan largely targets corporations and the nation’s biggest earners. The Tax Policy Center, for example, estimated that more than 90% of the tax increases from Biden’s plan would be borne by the top 20% of earners. ""No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year,"" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis.  Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said there are some specific scenarios where Biden’s proposals related to itemized deductions, retirement benefits and payroll taxes could result in ""potential direct tax hikes"" for some households under $400,000. For example, in a scenario where one spouse makes more than $400,000 but the other incurs a loss that brings the adjusted gross income for their two-income household below $400,000, they could be hit by the Biden payroll tax, Watson said. In interviews, economic advisers to the Biden campaign said any final tax law would have mechanisms written in to prevent anybody making less than $400,000 from being inadvertently affected. ""It’s not hard to have a ‘hold harmless’ provision to deal with any oddball cases that seem unlikely to even ever arise,"" said Gene Sperling, a campaign adviser who was director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The groups that examined Biden’s tax plan also estimated that over time, some of the burden of Biden’s tax increases would fall to people making less than $400,000 in the form of lower wages or investment returns — indirect effects of the proposed corporate tax rate increase. These effects would be relatively small, and tax analysts say they make up the bulk of the hits dealt to lower earners under Biden’s tax plan. But they form the basis for Donald Trump Jr.’s claim that 82% of Americans would see their taxes raised. A Trump campaign spokesperson argued that the impact of the corporate tax rate increase is effectively a tax increase on individuals.  The Biden campaign, on the other hand, said the two are not equal. ""Nobody filling out their 1040 is going to see a tax increase, and nobody would consider that type of economic impact as a tax increase, even if it happened,"" said Sperling.  (AP Photo) According to the Tax Policy Center, the lowest 20% of earners would see their 2021 incomes drop by an average of $30 under Biden; the next would see an average loss of $110; the middle would see an average drop of $260; and the second-highest would see an average loss of $590.  The Penn Wharton Budget Model projects smaller average declines for 2021: $15 for the bottom 20%; $90 for the second quintile; $180 for the third quintile; and $360 for the fourth quintile. Trump Jr.’s 82% figure comes from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which estimated what share of each income group would experience a tax change as a result of Biden’s proposals. A little math gets to 82% of people affected. But the concept of indirect effects ""is distinct from how most normal people think about taxes,"" said Ricco, the Penn Wharton analyst. ""Only families with adjusted gross incomes of more than $400,000 would be sending a larger check to the IRS, or having more federal taxes withheld from their paychecks,"" Ricco said. Those taxpayers were between the top 1% and 2% of filers in 2017, said Watson, the Tax Foundation analyst, citing the IRS. The Penn Wharton Budget Model also shows how Biden’s tax plan would affect Americans if the indirect effects of the corporate tax are excluded. With the corporate tax plan removed from the analysis, the average tax change drops to zero for the bottom 90% of earners. ""We expect that between 1% and 2% of American families would see increases in individual income and payroll taxes,"" Ricco said.  There are other aspects of Biden’s plans that aren’t reflected in independent tax analyses.  The Trump campaign, for example, said Biden’s plan to reinstate the penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate should be thought of as a tax — which is in line with the Supreme Court’s reasoning when it upheld the mandate in 2012. The Biden campaign said it’s a fee, pointing to the Health and Human Services Department’s language. Economic advisers to the Biden campaign, meanwhile, said the tax analyses don’t account for Biden’s proposed tax credits and spending programs aimed at middle-class and lower earners. Those and other Biden proposals ""will substantially boost middle-class incomes for families across the country,"" said Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates.  Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, said Biden has proposed many tax credits, including recent proposals for a refundable child- and dependent-care tax credit, a refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers, and a low-income renters credit. If the Penn Wharton Budget Model factored in Biden’s tax credits — and it did not — then the 82% figure representing the percent of Americans who would experience changes to their after-tax incomes ""would be substantially lower,"" Mermin said.  Ricco said the Penn Wharton analysis focused only on ""revenue-raising provisions.""  Donald Trump Jr. said, ""Joe Biden wants to raise taxes on 82% of all Americans."" Trump inaccurately described an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The 82% is a calculation made using the model’s estimates that represents the percentage of people whose after-tax incomes would change under Biden’s plan. But there’s a difference between a tax increase and the share of corporate tax increases borne by individual taxpayers in the form or lower investment returns or incomes. Biden has pledged not to directly raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000 per year.  Some Biden tax credits not included in Penn Wharton analysis could potentially offset some of the indirect hits posed to lower earners as a result of Biden’s proposed corporate tax hike.

The tests are rigged. The death count is false. Masks are useless. Hand sanitizer is toxic. Vaccines are poison. The government and media are lying.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ve already looked into several claims in the post.  COVID-19 tests aren’t rigged. A common cold won’t cause a false positive, the tests are not scientifically meaningless (though there’s new thinking about the most effective testing methods), and we’ve found no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating test results.  The death count isn’t false. It’s at about 187,000 in the United States and rising. If anything, doctors say that there’s an undercount of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.  Masks aren’t useless. A growing body of evidence shows that wearing one can reduce transmission of COVID-19.  Health officials recommend using hand sanitizer to kill the coronavirus.  And we’ve debunked plenty of false claims about coronavirus vaccines in development, including that the vaccine has killed Ukranirans and kids.  So what about the allegation that the COVID-19 isn’t killing people — and that their weak immune systems are? Anyone — not just people who are immunocompromised — can catch COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Some people are more likely than others to become severely ill: older adults and people with underlying medical conditions. The CDC also urges people with weakened immune systems to protect themselves from the disease.  ""Many conditions and treatments can weaken a person’s immune system (making them ‘immunocompromised’),"" the CDC says, listing examples such as cancer, bone marrow transplant and HIV.  The CDC found that of the people who died from COVID-19, 6% had only the coronavirus, while the rest had other conditions as well. But that doesn’t mean that only 6% of people actually died from COVID-19, as the president recently claimed.  Comorbidities are conditions that patients experience in tandem with a primary condition. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a recent interview with ""Good Morning America"" that it ""does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn’t die of COVID-19 — they did."" Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the public health department in Chicago, explained during a news conference that coronavirus can exacerbate or cause health problems. ""If, unfortunately, this person dies while they’re in the hospital, the doctor has to fill out the death certificate and you list things that this person had as well as what is the ultimate cause of death,"" she said.  Like Fauci, she said that these people are dying from COVID-19 — not their other conditions.  And young, healthy people do die from COVID-19, even if they represent a minority of the disease’s victims, according to the Proto, a publication from Massachusetts General Hospital.  We rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2020/sep/04/viral-image/people-are-dying-covid-19/

Fact-checking Fla. Rep. Mucarsel-Powell’s attack on Gimenez over bridge collapse
","Claims of corruption in connection with a fatal bridge collapse are at the heart of an attack in a South Florida congressional race.  Democratic incumbent Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell makes the attack against her Republican challenger, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, during a one-minute ad that claims ""Corrupt Carlos"" and his sons were ""were connected to shady deal after shady deal, getting rich on our tax dollars."" The toss-up race pits Mucarsel-Powell, who immigrated from Ecuador as a child and is finishing her first term in Washington, against Cuban-born Gimenez, who has served as mayor of Florida’s most populous county since 2011. It’s one of 18 pivotal House and Senate races up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. The main theme of Mucarsel-Powell’s campaign ad concerns the 2018 collapse of a pedestrian bridge at Florida International University in Miami, where Mucarsel-Powell once worked in the College of Health. The accident killed a bridge worker and five others, including Alexa Duran, an 18-year-old FIU student. Ten more were injured. The ad claims that Gimenez’s son C.J. Gimenez ""lobbied for the company that built that failed FIU bridge"" and that C.J’s brother, Julio Gimenez, worked at the firm. ""And after the bridge collapsed and killed six people, Gimenez extended the company’s $130 million contract."" The Gimenez sons did do work for the construction company during a period leading up to when the university announced that the company would be involved in the bridge’s construction, but they each cut formal ties before the bridge collapse. And while Carlos Gimenez did initially approve a contract extension following the bridge collapse for the company to do airport work, not bridge work, that extension was also ratified unanimously by a county board. Florida International University announced in February 2016 that Tallahassee-based FIGG Bridge Engineers and Miami’s MCM — also formerly known as Munilla Construction Management — would design and build a $9.3 million pedestrian bridge. It was projected to be finished by summer 2018. During construction on March 15, 2018, a 174-foot-long span fell about 18 feet onto a highway, crushing eight vehicles. ""FIGG Bridge Engineers severely underestimated the demand on the bridge (and) significantly overestimated the bridge’s capacity,"" National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said when the federal agency released its report on the accident in October 2019.  ""Contributing to the severity of the collapse outcome was the failure"" of FIGG, MCM and others to cease work when cracking in the section that failed ""reached unacceptable levels,"" the report said. In May, Florida’s Department of Transportation announced it will launch a bid process for designing and building a new bridge. Carlos Gimenez’s wife, Lourdes Gimenez, is a cousin of the Munilla brothers, who run MCM, now known as Magnum Construction Management. Their son Julio Gimenez was a general superintendent at MCM from 2006 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile. He left shortly after his father’s election as mayor in June 2011, the Miami Herald reported. Another son, C.J. Gimenez, was a registered lobbyist for MCM as of January 2016, according to a Miami-Dade Expressway Authority web page posted by Mucarsel’s campaign. MCM has said he lobbied for the company in 2015. C.J. Gimenez offered the firm pro bono communications advice after the bridge collapse, according to someone who has spoken to him, the Miami Herald reported, without identifying that person. C.J. Gimenez and the firm both told the newspaper he had no official role with the firm. In February 2019, Carlos Gimenez administratively extended through August 2020 a contract the county had made with MCM in 2011 for work at Miami International Airport.  Five months later, he recommended that the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners ratify the extension. The board did so unanimously, although one commissioner later said he didn’t realize that that’s what he had voted for. Gimenez had said the extension with MCM, which filed for bankruptcy in March 2019 following the bridge collapse, would allow for continuity of work at the airport until a new contract could be approved.  The extension covered a $40 million piece of a $130 million contract. In response to the extension, the state Legislature passed a bill to require local airport authorities to abide by new ethics rules or lose state transportation money. It has not yet been presented to Gov. Ron DeSantis. Once it has, he has 15 days to take action.  ""Once we receive the bill, the Governor will review the legislation and make a decision based on the best interest of Florida,"" a DeSantis spokesman said. Mucarsel-Powell claimed that after a March 2018 bridge collapse that killed six people, Gimenez extended a $130 million contract to the construction company, where one of his sons worked and for which another lobbied. The two sons did work for the company in the period leading up to when Florida International University announced that the company would participate in the bridge construction, but cut formal ties before the bridge collapse. The Miami Herald reported that an unnamed source said C.J. Gimenez offered the firm pro bono communications advice after the bridge collapse.  Nearly a year after the accident, Gimenez extended part of a 2011 contract with the company for airport construction work. The county board approved the extension.

Joe Biden wrong about how early he called to invoke the Defense Production Act
","During an event to discuss school reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden repeated a talking point he’s used previously — that he was ahead of the curve in calling for the Defense Production Act to be used to boost manufacturing of high-demand health products, such as protective equipment. In a question-and-answer session with reporters following his Sept. 2 event in Wilmington, Del., Biden said, ""When it got up to March, I kept saying, look, you’ve got to invoke, and you remember, I think I was the first — I may be mistaken — person calling about the Defense Production Act. … Use that authority. Use it to go out there now and don’t wait to talk about the need for us to have masks."" Biden said he may be mistaken, and he is. But Biden made similar remarks in mid to late March, which our friends at FactCheck.org rated skeptically. Since he has continued to say it, we will put it on the Truth-O-Meter. Let’s take a fresh look. The Defense Production Act was signed by President Harry Truman in 1950 and amended periodically since then. Broadly, it allows the federal government to take a stronger role in directing domestic manufacturing capabilities during a national emergency, according to the Congressional Research Service.  These powers allow the government to tell private businesses when and how to fulfill orders for essential goods. Over the years, its scope has been expanded from military needs to natural hazards, terrorist attacks, and other national emergencies. ""The DPA is one of those seemingly obscure laws that is actually extraordinarily significant,"" Margaret O’Mara, a University of Washington historian who studies the connections between government and industry, told us in March. The earliest discussion of using the Defense Production Act to combat the coronavirus came on Feb. 26, just three weeks after the first coronavirus death in the United States. Here’s a rundown: Feb. 26: New York City emergency management commissioner Deanne Criswell, at a press conference with Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking about masks, said, ""There's just a long waiting list and the only way to fulfill that is by the federal government. They have means where they can enact the Defense Production Act and get people to produce these more quickly."" Feb. 28: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a White House roundtable for the media: ""We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary to enable that our contracts go to the front of the line on contracting. That is an authority that we have, and we intend to use it to acquire anything that we need to acquire. We won't use it unnecessarily, of course. We don't want to be disruptive if that's not needed. But if we need to, we will use it. We won't hesitate."" March 1: Azar said in an appearance on Fox News Sunday, ""Right now, we are initiating the procurement processes for personal protective equipment, so that would be masks, as well as gowns, gloves, etc. We've got that process initiated. We're gathering information from potential vendors."" Asked by host Chris Wallace whether that would be using authority under the act, Azar said, ""If we need to."" March 13: A letter from 57 House Democrats urged the president to ""use the powers afforded by"" the Defense Production Act ""to begin the mass production of supplies."" March 15: Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., released a statement about a letter he wrote to the White House urging use of the Defense Production Act.  March 15: During the evening Democratic debate, Biden did not mention the Defense Production Act (nor did any of the other candidates). Biden pointed to his coronavirus plan on his campaign website, but that version of the plan did not include the Defense Production Act. March 17: At a White White House coronavirus task force press briefing, Trump himself was asked, ""Do you need to invoke the Defense Production Act to get more of those medical supplies to different hospitals across the country?"" He answered, ""Well, we're able to do that if we have to. Right now we haven't had to, but it's certainly ready."" March 18: In the first statement we could locate by Biden on the issue, he released a statement urging the administration to ""prioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis — such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate — by invoking the Defense Production Act."" March 18: Trump signed an executive order citing the authority of the act to curb the spread of coronavirus. He specifically mentioned Title I, part of which involves prioritizing contracts that serve national emergency goals over any other contracts or orders. Trump’s executive order specifically named ""personal protective equipment and ventilators.""  Later that day, Trump indicated a certain reluctance in a tweet. ""I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!"" Biden’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry seeking earlier comments by the candidate about the Defense Production Act. It’s worth noting that while several contracts have been awarded under the act’s authority, critics have said that Trump hasn’t used the Defense Production Act to its fullest extent. Several experts made this case to the New York Times in late July. Trump has not used the act ""to create a permanent, sustainable, redundant, domestic supply chain for all things pandemic: testing, swabs, N95 masks, etc.,"" Jamie Baker, a former legal adviser to the National Security Council and a professor of national security law at Syracuse University, told the Times. Still, even if Biden agrees that Trump’s follow-through has been weak, it doesn’t mean that he was the first official to call for the Defense Production Act to be used. Biden has said several times he was the first person calling for use of the Defense Production Act.  But Biden was far from the first. A full 18 days before Biden made his first public comment on the act, Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary had publicly floated the idea, and Trump made it official the same day Biden made his remarks. In between, dozens of Democratic lawmakers publicly called for the act to be used, and Biden did not mention it in a Democratic primary debate.

Trump campaign is wrong — Biden has repeatedly condemned violence tied to protests
","As we inch toward a presidential election amid a reignited national conversation around race and police brutality, President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden continue to take aim at each other on the issue.  Trump spoke on Sept. 1, 2020 with law enforcement and business owners in Kenosha, a city reeling after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, which spawned nights of unrest that came to a head when, prosecutors say, a 17-year-old from Illinois shot and killed two protesters. The day the president visited, his Wisconsin campaign released a statement criticizing Biden for being weak on issues of ""law and order,"" a message Trump has championed as he seeks re-election.  The statement included this claim: ""Biden failed to condemn far-left violent groups like Antifa, instead faulting only the brave men and women of law enforcement.""  It’s a talking point Trump and his allies have begun to push, despite significant evidence to the contrary.  Let’s take a look.  Biden, who visited Kenosha Sept. 3, 2020, hasn’t minced words denouncing the unrest that followed Blake’s shooting and the death of George Floyd in May.  Days after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck and the city — and nation — erupted in protest, Biden said: ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary … But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not."" On June 2, 2020, he said: ""There is no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches, or destroying businesses.""  On Aug. 26, 2020, three days after Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey shot Jacob Blake, Biden said in a video: ""Burning down communities is not protest, it’s needless violence — violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses that serve the community. That’s wrong."" Last Sunday, Aug. 30, 2020, Biden tweeted, ""I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right,"" and encouraged Trump to pledge to do the same.   And, in Kenosha he said this: ""Protesting is protesting … but none of it justifies looting, burning or anything else."" To be sure, Biden has not blamed Antifa by name, but on July 28, 2020, he said: ""Arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted … local law enforcement can do that."" And in condemning ""violence of every kind by anyone,"" he certainly includes any Antifa supporters. Trump also claims that Biden has instead faulted ""only the brave men and women of law enforcement."" As noted, he has not solely faulted law enforcement. But what is Trump referring to? At one point, Biden did criticize the actions of federal officers sent to Portland, Ore., to help control protests, saying in a statement that the agents had been ""brutally attacking"" peaceful protesters and were ""stok(ing) the fires of division,"" as the Trump campaign notes in a separate release.  But that focused on a particular issue in a particular place. It was not a widespread condemnation of law enforcement officials who are facing protests and violence across the country. And it is not the only place he has laid blame, as the litany of other comments shows. Trump’s campaign claimed that ""Biden failed to condemn far-left violent groups like Antifa, instead faulting only the brave men and women of law enforcement."" Numerous statements from Biden decrying violence, arson and looting tied to protests against police brutality show that claim is demonstrably untrue.  We rate the claim False.   ",/factchecks/2020/sep/03/donald-trump/trump-campaign-wrong-biden-has-repeatedly-condemne/

Trump repeats false claim about COVID-19 deaths on Fox News
","In the past week, President Donald Trump has repeatedly spread a false claim that COVID-19 is not as deadly as his own public health agencies have reported. He retweeted a now-deleted post that alleged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""quietly updated"" the number of coronavirus deaths. He shared another tweet from a senior legal adviser for his reelection campaign that linked to an article whose headline said ""only 9,210 Americans died from COVID-19 alone."" And, in a Sept. 1 interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, Trump said it himself: ""I saw a statistic come out the other day, talking about only 6% of the people actually died from COVID, which is a very interesting — that they died from other reasons."" ""Well, they had comorbidities, which you’ve gotten criticized for,"" Ingraham responded. She’s right — the president misconstrued data on coronavirus deaths. As of Sept. 3, CDC data show 185,092 Americans had died due to COVID-19, and some estimates put the death toll higher. Trump’s claim traces back to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the CDC. Each Wednesday, the agency releases new provisional death counts for the coronavirus. The data is based on death certificates.  In that report, the NCHS notes in a section titled ""Comorbidities"" that, ""for 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned."" ""For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death,"" the report says. Those lines have inspired a rash of claims on social media, including those retweeted by the president, that say the CDC ""adjusted"" its coronavirus death counts and the disease is not as deadly as previously thought. Those assertions are false — we rated a related Facebook post Pants on Fire. Several other fact-checkers have also debunked them. Let’s recap why they’re wrong. Comorbidities are conditions that patients experience in tandem with a primary condition. Think of conditions like cancer or diabetes, which the CDC has said put people more at risk of death if they contract the coronavirus. The NCHS report shows that the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients with comorbidities. But that doesn’t mean COVID-19 was a non-factor. ""The point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of them had nothing else but just COVID-19,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a Sept. 1 interview with ""Good Morning America."" ""That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn’t die of COVID-19 — they did."" ""The numbers that you’ve been hearing, the 180,000-plus deaths, are real deaths from COVID-19. Let there not be any confusion about that."" So why do 94% of death certificates that mention COVID-19 also list other conditions?  When a coronavirus patient is admitted to the hospital, the virus is listed on their medical record. Since the coronavirus attacks the lungs, perhaps they develop respiratory failure, which would also be listed on their record. Unfortunately, they die after going into cardiac arrest, so doctors take note of that, too. RELATED: No, the CDC did not ‘quietly adjust’ US coronavirus deaths All three of those conditions would be listed on the patient’s death certificate, but COVID-19 started the process. ""The people dying were not going to die but for the acquisition of COVID,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the NCHS, told us in an email that 92% of the death certificates that mention the coronavirus state that COVID-19 was the ""underlying cause of death."" ""The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death,"" Lancashire said.  We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s comparison of violent crime, murders data
","Joe Biden told voters that President Donald Trump doesn’t have his facts straight when it comes to public safety, despite Trump’s attempts to cast himself as a law-and-order candidate and Biden as the symbol of chaos.  ""If Donald Trump wants to ask the question: Who will keep you safer as president? Let’s answer that question. First, some simple facts,"" Biden said in Pittsburgh on Aug. 31.  ""When I was vice president, violent crime fell 15% in this country. We did it without chaos and disorder. And yes, we did it with Democratic mayors in most of the major cities in this country. The murder rate now is up 26% across the nation this year under Donald Trump. Do you feel really safer under Donald Trump?"" PolitiFact decided to fact-check Biden’s ""simple facts."" We found that his claim is partly accurate and needs context.  Biden’s claim of a 15% decrease is supported by the change in the rate of violent crime; the decline in the total number of crimes was less than 15%. Biden’s campaign cited as evidence a 2017 story from FactCheck.org, which summarized key statistics related to President Barack Obama’s eight years in office. Based on data collected by the FBI, the fact-checking organization found that the number of violent crimes per 100,000 people in Obama’s last full year in office, 2016, was nearly 16% lower than the rate in 2008, the year before Obama took office. Likewise, the total number of violent crimes in 2016 was about 10% lower than the total number in 2008. In discussing what Biden says has happened to the murder rate under Trump, Biden’s campaign cited an analysis by crime analyst Jeff Asher that pointed out a 26% increase in the number of murders. The analysis was not adjusted for population and did not specify the rate change. (For instance, the FBI calculates the murder rate as being per 100,000 people.) But Asher and two other criminologists not involved in the analysis told PolitiFact that since the population changes very little from one year to the other, the murder rate increase would also be around 26%. Asher analyzed violent crime data in 25 U.S. cities. He looked at the number of murders in 2019 from January through at least July and compared it with the number of murders in 2020 from January through at least July. (He used comparable August data for some cities.)  While Asher’s analysis focused on select cities, not nationwide data, he said it can be useful for estimating the national trend. Usually, the FBI in late September releases a final report on nationwide crime statistics from the previous year. Biden touted a decrease in violent crime during his vice presidency and denounced a 2020 spike in murders under Trump. But he highlighted different metrics and different time sets for each administration. By doing so, Biden presented an incomplete and skewed picture of the crime data. A more accurate examination of crime would focus on the same set of data and comparable time periods, said Jay Corzine, a criminologist at the University of Central Florida. The FBI figures on violent crime include the offenses of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Biden focused on this broader number for the claim about his vice presidency, and flagged only murder data for the claim on Trump’s record. Biden focused on numbers before and at the end of his 8-year tenure, 2008 and 2016. For Trump, he focused on about seven months for 2019 and 2020. For the claim about his own record, Biden did not mention the murder rate. The murder rate in 2008 was the same as it was in 2016, 5.4 murders per 100,000 people.
Both the violent crime and murder rates went down in 2017 and in 2018, Trump’s first two years in office. (The FBI has not released final data for 2019.) Asher said that while murders so far were up in 2020 compared with 2019, ""violent crime is roughly even.""   Most of the influence any presidential administration has on crime statistics is indirect, based on their support for anti-crime measures and funding assistance, criminologists told PolitiFact. ""Most crime is local and what really impacts crime rates are local policing, state laws — what states and cities do,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. Homicide numbers are also volatile, there’s wide fluctuation from year to year that has nothing to do with laws or policies, Fox said. Built into the homicide figures are a lot of chance factors, such as where a bullet hits and whether the person is taken to a hospital on time, he said.  Murders in some cities have spiked this year amid the coronavirus pandemic, yet violent crime across the board (including property crime) hasn’t similarly increased, Corzine noted. It’s unclear exactly why murders are up in some places. However, ""bad things can happen in the course of idle time,"" Fox said, noting that the pandemic caused many people to be out of work and out of school with no summer activities. Biden said, ""When I was vice president, violent crime fell 15% in this country. ... The murder rate now is up 26% across the nation this year under Donald Trump."" The violent crime rate fell nearly 16% from 2008, before Biden’s vice presidency, to 2016, his last full year as vice president. A crime analyst found that in some cities, the total number of murders has gone up at least 26% in 2020 compared to the same timeframe in 2019 (experts said the crime rate likely would also be up about 26%). But Biden’s comparison is based on snapshots of different crime data and at different time intervals during each presidency.

What caught our attention was the second part of the sentence, that Freitas ""supports a plan letting insurance companies deny coverage for preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes."" We decided to fact check it.  The DCCC sources its ad claim with a May 2, 2018 newspaper article in The Virginian-Pilot. Freitas ran unsuccessfully that spring for the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate, and the article was about a debate he had with one of his opponents - E.W. Jackson. One of the topics was the Affordable Care Act, also called ""Obamacare,"" which mandates a number of health care reforms, including a requirement that insurers provide health coverage for preexisting conditions. The article quoted Freitas calling Obamacare a ""cancer"" that will lead to a government-run health care system.  The Democratic Party of Virginia sent us several writings by Freitas expressing scorn for Obamacare. ""As your next U.S. senator, I will lead the fight to repeal Obamacare full-stop,"" he wrote on Facebook on June 1, 2018. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have long called for abolishing Obamacare while promising to keep its popular guarantee of long-term coverage for  preexisting conditions. But they haven’t agreed on a plan. A major issue has been how can they create a free-market healthcare system and still mandate affordable coverage for preexisting conditions.  Obamacare forbids an insurer from charging anyone more than three times the premium charged to a healthy 21-year-old for the same policy. If Obamacare was repealed without a replacement plan, insurers could choose to curtail or end coverage for preexisting conditions, or steeply raise the price.   Republicans have floated several replacement plans but, as PolitiFact National has written, none protected affordable coverage for preexisting conditions as well as Obamacare.  Some Republicans have favored repealing Obamacare before a replacement is found. That includes Freitas. ""Obamacare is hurting people...and yet progressives demand that we find an alternative to Obamacare before we can repeal it,"" he wrote on Facebook on Dec. 13, 2014. ""This is a little like someone repeatedly punching you in the face and demanding that you find an alternative activity for their fist before they agree to stop."" Freitas doesn’t include health care among six issues he addresses on his campaign website. Joe Desilets, Freitas’ campaign manager, told us Freitas still wants to abolish Obamacare. But he said Freitas is dedicated to protecting coverage for preexisting conditions and, contrary to his 2014 statement, wants a replacement plan before the law is repealed.  Desilits said Freitas is not committed to any specific replacement plan to guarantee coverage of preexisting conditions. ""Tax credits, a more targeted health care system. There’s a number of ways you can do it,"" he said. In the Virginia General Assembly in 2018, Freitas supported the Trump-ordered expansion of short-term, inexpensive health policies that don’t comply with Obamacare and don't have to cover preexisting conditions.  Former President Barack Obama in 2016 issued a rule limiting short-term policies to 90 days to provide stop-gap policies to people who lost their health coverage and were waiting for enrollment periods to begin on the individual insurance market. In an effort to weaken Obamacare, Trump changed the rule, allowing short-term policies to last 364 days and be renewed twice. Supporters said the Trump rule would help people without employer-provided insurance who had seen steep premium increases in their ACA-compliant policies. Critics said it would lead to ""junk insurance"" with high deductibles. Our ruling In a TV ad, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says Freitas ""supports a plan letting insurance companies deny coverage for preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes."" Freitas has repeatedly called for the abolishing Obamacare, which mandates that long-term health insurance policies cover preexisting conditions. In 2014, he said Obamacare should be repealed even without a replacement plan. In 2018, he voted to significantly expand the duration of short-term insurance plans in which coverage of preexisting conditions can be legally denied.  These actions overshadow Freitas’ vague promise this year - made through his campaign manager - to protect preexisting condition coverage while working to end Obamacare. We rate the DCCC's claim True.  ",/factchecks/2020/sep/03/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/freitas-has-backed-plans-undercut-coverage-preexis/

Cooper overstates ventilator access problem
","North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper says one of his goals is to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.  While that may be a noble cause, Republicans are questioning a claim he made during a recent briefing. ""In some of these other states, some of their deaths can be attributable to the fact that they were having a hard time getting an ICU bed or a ventilator to a patient,"" Cooper said during a press conference on Aug. 13. Is it true that some people have died because they had trouble accessing a ventilator, or a bed in the intensive care unit? It’s true that more patients die at hospitals that are overwhelmed, as studies demonstrated even before the onset of the current pandemic. The Cooper administration also cited news articles where doctors said they worried about having enough resources to provide optimum levels of care. But there’s little documentation of COVID-19 patients dying specifically because they couldn’t access a ventilator or ICU bed. At the onset of the pandemic, medical experts worried that there wouldn’t be enough ventilators to save patients who had severe symptoms of COVID-19. The virus primarily affects the lungs and ventilators are designed to help patients breathe. The availability of ventilators became a political issue, with some governors saying the Trump administration didn’t provide their states with enough of the machines. PolitiFact investigated the issue of ventilator access, finding in late April that it hadn’t become the nationwide problem health experts and medical professionals feared. Officials from 30 states told PolitiFact that they weren’t aware of any cases where their hospitals couldn’t provide ventilators to COVID-19 patients. At the time, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association said the organization wasn’t aware of any patient dying because they couldn’t access a ventilator.  Presented with Cooper’s quote from August, the AHA spokesman said nothing has changed. ""To the best of our knowledge, a ventilator has been available for every patient that needed one. So nothing has changed since we said the same thing in April,"" AHA spokesman Colin Milligan said. PolitiFact North Carolina reached out to other experts quoted in the April fact check. Eric Toner is a senior scholar of internal and emergency medicine at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He previously said he ""would not be surprised if we find out later that some tragic triage choices had to be made."" We contacted Toner again and asked if he’s aware of anyone who died because they couldn’t access a ventilator. ""I do not,"" he said. ""There are hushed rumors but nothing that I can cite or that anyone will openly admit to."" Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado, was also quoted in PolitiFact’s April article. He told us that any evidence of such deaths are likely to be anecdotal, and not necessarily something that’s documented. ""If your ICU is full, you’re going to try to make the best of it. You’re likely going to try to treat them in a step-down unit,"" Wynia said. ""You’re not going to find anyone who says we openly discussed this with the family and says ‘I’m sorry, we’re out of beds and ventilators.’"" Low resources can affect a patient’s level of care, he added. ""It’s something that no one wants to say, and for good reason. The reality is when a healthcare system is completely overrun, it’s not able to deliver services at its normal quality."" When contacted by PolitiFact, the Cooper administration provided links to news stories where hospital officials worried about resources running out. They also provided links to studies that tied resource shortages to mortality rates. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that COVID-19 patients had higher survival rates at bigger hospitals, which tend to have more resources than small hospitals. Dr. David Leaf, who works in Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, explained the findings to WBUR in Boston: ""Patients who were admitted to hospitals with fewer than 50 ICU beds— so, smaller hospitals — had a more than threefold higher risk of death than patients admitted to larger hospitals."" A study of patient outcomes in Wuhan, China, found that the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) rooms had a significant impact on how long a patient lived, according to Contagion: Infectious Diseases Today. A July story in the Harvard Business Review used data from Germany and Italy to emphasize the need to relocate patients when ICU’s reach full capacity. Despite what the studies say, we struggled to find news stories about specific people who died waiting for an ICU bed or a ventilator. A March New York Times story reported that some have died inside the emergency room while waiting for a bed. Doctors told the Times that some patients were found dead in their rooms while doctors were busy helping others. A Buzzfeed article from April quoted several doctors who attributed deaths to a lack of resources. ""There’s a list about six [types of] patients that do not get put on a vent. ‘It makes no sense, they’re going to die soon anyway, so let them die’ — like that’s the crazy thought process,"" one doctor said. In July, Newsweek reported that a 70-year-old woman died less than a week after allegedly being turned away from two Florida hospitals. Also in July, CBS reported on a judge in Starr County, Texas, who said on Facebook that a lack of resources left a local hospital with the responsibility of choosing to help and ""who is sent home to die."" Cooper said ""in some of these other states, some of their deaths can be attributable to the fact that they were having a hard time getting an ICU bed or a ventilator to a patient."" Cooper was trying to make a point that it’s important to protect hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. That’s a valid concern, given studies show mortality rates can rise when hospitals are overwhelmed. Some news articles have also alluded to these problems. However, Cooper goes too far in saying some deaths have been attributed to a lack of ICU and ventilator access. The American Hospital Association, along with experts who have tracked resource availability during the pandemic, say they’re unaware of any specific cases where someone died specifically because they couldn’t access a ventilator or ICU bed. Cooper didn't cite, and PolitiFact couldn't find, enough evidence to support the claim. Cooper’s statement contains an element of truth, but doesn’t account for critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/sep/03/roy-cooper/cooper-overstates-ventilator-access-problem/

Georgia Sen. Perdue’s record on preexisting conditions doesn’t match his promises
","Health insurance has emerged as a defining issue in the Georgia Senate race, and Republican incumbent Sen. David Perdue declared that there is one angle where he can’t be attacked. ""I’ve always believed in protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. Period,"" Perdue tweeted Aug. 18. ""Anyone who says otherwise just isn’t telling the truth."" The campaign ad attached to the tweet adds, ""Health insurance should always cover preexisting conditions. For anyone. Period."" That is a sweeping policy — guaranteed coverage for anyone, with no penalty for a preexisting condition. If that’s Perdue’s position now, it doesn’t jibe with his record as a lawmaker. He’s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act — Obamacare — and a bill he cosponsored to guarantee coverage fails to match the ironclad protections under that law.  Perdue makes no bones about opposing the ACA, which contains several interlocking provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions. He voted to repeal it in 2015 and backed the Senate’s failed repeal-and-replace effort in 2017.  Perdue’s campaign said that it’s possible to be against Obamacare, and in favor of patient protections. It said, ""Perdue co-sponsored legislation to ensure preexisting conditions are covered at no additional cost to those patients."" That bill, called the Protect Act, never came to a vote in the Senate and doesn’t match the ACA’s guarantees.  The current law blocks insurers from using any eligibility rule, list of covered services or pricing to deny anyone coverage. The Protect Act does say that insurance companies can’t deny coverage based on ""any preexisting condition."" But it gives a carrier the option to deny certain coverage, if ""it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately."" Since the bill doesn’t define what that clause means, it leaves open the possibility that carriers could use it to drop coverage of certain expensive diseases from all of their policies. To Allison Hoffman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, that’s a big loophole. ""Insurers could exclude someone’s preexisting conditions from coverage, even if they offered her a policy,"" Hoffman told us in 2018 when the bill was first introduced. ""That fact alone sinks any claims that this law offers preexisting condition protection."" Rodney Whitlock, a health policy expert who worked for Republicans in Congress, told us concerns about loopholes are reasonable. ""Insurers will use the rules available to them to take in more in premiums than they pay out in claims,"" Whitlock said in 2018. ""If you see a loophole and think insurers will use it, that’s probably true."" Hoffman notes that the Protect Act’s language against insurers discriminating based on genetic information also concerns her. The bill says carriers ""shall not request, require, or purchase genetic information with respect to any individual prior to such individual's enrollment."" But the bill says information collected incidentally can be used by insurers. That could happen, for example, when an employee inadvertently reveals details on a questionnaire, despite being told not to include information that can be linked back to their DNA. Insurers can’t use that information for setting premiums, but Hoffman says it could shape the list of covered maladies. ""If an insurer comes across genetic information incidentally, it seems to me that they could exclude any related conditions,"" Hoffman warned. ""This loophole could be huge considering the amount of incidental collection and how broadly it is construed."" The bill has other holes: for instance, permitting insurers to charge women more than men. Perdue’s stance on short-term health insurance plans also raises issues.  These plans offer limited coverage that’s intended to tide people over when they’re between jobs. They don’t need to follow the strict rules of the ACA. They don’t have to cover the package of essential benefits under the law and they can exclude coverage for preexisting conditions. Under the ACA, they were limited to 90 days’ coverage. The Trump administration extended that to 364 days, with the option to renew them for up to three years. Perdue voted against a 2018 resolution to oppose Trump’s expansion of short-term plans. The measure failed by one vote. The Perdue campaign said that Obamacare isn’t the only way to take care of people. ""The best way to protect those with preexisting conditions, lower costs for all Georgians, and expand access to coverage is through free market solutions,"" the campaign said in a statement. The campaign noted that many counties have only one insurance company offering coverage. It argues that if more companies found it profitable to move into those areas, competition would improve the options for consumers. Perdue said that his policy is that ""health insurance should always cover preexisting conditions. For anyone. Period."" Perdue opposes the Affordable Care Act and weighed in on the side of short-term health plans that lack some of the ACA’s strong protections for people with preexisting conditions. Perdue’s bill to maintain those protections contains loopholes that insurance companies could use to avoid covering certain conditions. Perdue’s promise is sweeping and absolute. The policies he has backed offer some limited protections, but don’t match that promise.

Collage of gruesome attacks has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter

Claim Viewed By Millions On Social Media Says California Legalized Pedophilia. That Is False.
","Hours after the California Legislature passed Senate Bill 145 on Sunday, an onslaught of social media posts claimed the bill would ""legalize pedophilia"" in the state or allow adults to have sex with minors without being placed on the sex offender registry.  All of the posts are provocative and many are unsubstantiated.  Several were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) We focused on a Facebook post that was viewed 1.2 million times in less than 24 hours after it was published Tuesday afternoon. Similar posts were viewed and shared thousands of times. ""PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA. Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender. This is unbelievable California!""  Prominent public figures from state Senate Republican Leader Shannon Grove to former San Francisco Giants baseball player Aubrey Huff to some Democratic state lawmakers have spoken out against the bill, though their statements do not go so far as to describe the bill as legalizing sex with minors. With so many claims swirling, we decided to check the facts.  The Facts About SB 145 Current state allows a judge to decide whether to place a young man convicted of statutory rape, in which vaginal intercourse takes place with a minor, on the sex offender registry based on the facts of the case.  There is no such discretion when the offense includes anal or oral sex.  SB 145 would eliminate automatic sex-offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor. Instead, a judge would make the decision, as with cases involving vaginal intercourse. The law would not apply in cases where a one party does not believe the sexual contact was voluntary. LGBTQ advocates, including the bill’s author state Sen. Scott Wiener (D–San Francisco), say it would do away with a discriminatory law, one that’s a relic of a penal code that criminalized those acts until 1975, even between consenting adults.  ""This distinction in the law is irrational and discriminatory towards LGBTQ youth,"" Wiener said in a fact sheet on the law produced by his office, Equality California and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office, all of which support the bill. ""SB 145 ends this irrational distinction by treating all sex the same way that the law currently treats penile-vaginal intercourse."" Decades ago, police used the fact that certain sex acts were illegal to raid gay clubs and charge people with crimes, said Asm. Sydney Kamlager, D-Los Angeles, a supporter of the bill, during a press conference last month. Kamlager said the disparity in the law was ""put in place during a more conservative time in California and historically these [police raids] were done systematically to target folks to remove people who identified as being LGBT from our society."" Sex With A Minor Remains Illegal, In All Cases, Under SB 145 Some of the claims on social media say the bill protects rapists or lessens penalties for statutory rape. That’s not the case.  Nothing in the legislation would change penalties for statutory rape, which prosecutors in California can charge as either a misdemeanor or felony. It is illegal under current law for any adult to have any type of sex with a minor and that remains illegal under SB 145.  Also, the bill does not apply to any sex offenders convicted of forcible rape.  The legislation is supported by the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault and by law enforcement groups such as the California Police Chiefs Association and the California District Attorney’s Association. Claim About A 21-Year-Old Having Sex With An 11-Year-Old The second part of the Facebook post that we fact-checked claims, ""Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender."" That’s also wrong.  SB 145 only applies to young people ages 14, 15, 16 or 17 and any offender within a 10 year age range. ""The vast, vast majority of cases where a judge may decide NOT to put someone on the registry will be cases where the age range is close,"" the bill’s fact sheet estimates. ""At the end of the day, a judge will have full discretion to place someone on the registry, and a prosecutor can seek it."" Our Rating A widely-shared Facebook post claimed California had legalized ""pedophilia,"" and that ""Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender.""  That post and many like it are simply wrong.  They grossly distort the proposals in state SB 145, which aims to eliminate a disparity in how LGBTQ young people are treated on California’s sex offender registry.  The legislation would eliminate automatic sex offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. Instead, a judge would make that decision, just as existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders in cases involving vaginal intercourse on the registry. The bill would not, in any fashion, make it legal for any adult to have any type of sex with a minor. The only change involves giving a judge discretion over whether to list an offender on the sex registry for certain sex acts.  We rate the claims in the Facebook post Pants on Fire.  PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.",/factchecks/2020/sep/02/facebook-posts/claim-viewed-millions-social-media-says-california/
