Do CEOs make 300 times the average worker, as Joe Kennedy said?
","During the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III bemoaned the seismic income gap between top executives and the average employee, even as he celebrated the current bullish economy. Emphasizing the need for greater economic fairness, Kennedy said workers should take home a larger share of corporate profits, relative to that of their bosses. ""We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices,"" he said, ""and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right."" We wondered if the pay gap between top executives and the average employee was as wide as Kennedy claimed. As we’ve noted previously, the gap between CEOs and workers is vast, but there’s no standard formula for computing the figure, which means there’s room to quibble over the numbers. Results vary based on which corporations — and how many of them — are used in a study, and researchers use different definitions to define workers and stock options, and to compute salaries. At the high end is the AFL-CIO. The labor union’s analysis compared the 2016 compensation of CEOs of S&P 500 Index to those of production and nonsupervisory workers. It found top executives, on average, received $13.1 million in total compensation, while the average employee earned $37,632. That’s a ratio of 347 to 1. An analysis by the liberal Economic Policy Institute also produced a large disparity in pay, though relatively smaller than that of the AFL-CIO. The institute’s study of 2016 compensation used two different measurements, which varied in their treatment of executives’ stock options. The first measure assumed stock options were cashed in, and therefore were added to CEOs salary, bonuses and other payouts. Under that measure, CEO compensation was found to 271 times the average worker’s pay. Under the second measure, in which stock options were granted but not cashed in, the ratio was 224-to-1. Bloomberg analyzed 2017 income data and found CEOs made 265 times more than the income paid to average workers. Kennedy’s office did not reply to our request for comment. Kennedy said, ""Top CEOs (are) making 300 times the average worker."" His numbers describing today’s ratio, while credible, are on the high side of research. The AFL-CIO put the ratio at 347-to-1. The liberal Economic Policy Institute said CEOs make either 271 or 224 times that of average employees, depending on how you measure stock options. Bloomberg pegged the ratio at 265-to-1.

Fact-checking Donald Trump's misleading claim about the release of 'dangerous terrorists'
","President Donald Trump reaffirmed his commitment to crack down on terrorists and blamed those before him for not doing enough in his first State of the Union speech. ""In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released,"" Trump said Jan. 30. Those claims are misleading. Trump is referring to the number of prisoners released from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, who were confirmed of re-engaging in some type of terrorist activity. About every six months, the Director of National Intelligence releases figures about detainees transferred from Guantanamo and how many are known to have re-engaged in some sort of terrorist activity. The most recent report was published in October 2017 and includes data from 2002, when the prison opened, through July 2017. During that time, the U.S. government transferred more than 700 detainees from Guantanamo, and 122 of them were ""confirmed of re-engaging"" in some sort of terrorist activity. Eight of those transfers happened during the Obama administration. The remaining 114 — or over 92 percent — happened under George W. Bush. So Trump’s ""hundreds and hundreds"" is really 122 combatants spread out over 15 years. Trump claimed that the United States was responsible for releasing Baghdadi back into the battlefield, but that claim is also missing key context. From early February 2004 until early December 2004, Baghdadi was held at a U.S. detention system known as Camp Bucca, according to the Defense Department. However, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis in 2004, who released him some time later. In a previous fact-check, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro falsely tied President Barack Obama to Baghdadi’s release. Baghdadi was not in U.S. custody when Obama was in office. The framework for transfers was set up while Bush was president. The legal contract between the United States and Iraq guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi, and there is no evidence that he was on anyone’s radar. Trump said, ""We have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi."" Trump is overstating the number of prisoners released from Guantanamo, who were confirmed of re-engaging in some type of terrorist activity. That number is 122, not ""hundreds and hundreds."" He is also not entirely right that al-Baghdadi was ""released"" by the United States. The ISIS leader was was handed over to the Iraqi justice system, which released him some time later.

Donald Trump exaggerates energy exports
","President Donald Trump put himself on the side of average Americans in his effort to reduce government regulations, particularly on energy. ""We have ended the war on American Energy and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal,"" Trump said. ""We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world."" There are different ways to understand the claim that America is ""now ... an exporter of energy."" One way to read Trump’s statement is that the United States only recently began to export energy. This is flat wrong. ""We have been exporting coal, natural gas, electricity, refined products and energy technologies for a very long time,"" Paul Sullivan, a professor at National Defense University, told us in August. ""Liquefied natural gas exports from Alaska to Japan have been around for a long time."" Trump might have meant that the United States had only recently become a net exporter of energy — meaning the total of all U.S. energy exports recently overtook the total of all U.S. energy imports. That’s also inaccurate. ""This has been falling, but we are still a huge net energy importer,"" Jason Bordoff, who directs Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told us. In its most recent projections, the federal Energy Information Administration concluded that the United States would become a net energy exporter around 2026, depending on the course of future patterns of global supply, demand and pricing. The United States has been a net coal exporter for many years. It has been a net exporter of refined petroleum products since around 2011. So neither of those would make Trump correct. Natural gas has done better. In the Energy Information Administration's January 2018 shorter-term energy outlook, it reported that ""in 2017, the United States was a net exporter of natural gas for the first time on an annual basis since 1957."" We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said, ""We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world."" The United States has been exporting different forms of energy for many years. It has been a net exporter of coal and refined petroleum products, a fact that predates Trump. The one new development is natural gas. For the first time since 1957, the United States became a net exporter in 2017. Overall though, it is a net energy importer, a situation that’s not expected to change until midway through the next decade.

Donald Trump: ISIS territory losses near 100 percent
","President Donald Trump spoke proudly of gains made in the fight against the Islamic State. He looked back to his pledge in 2017 to ""extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth."" ""One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and Syria,"" Trump said. According to data from IHS Markit, a private defense and security research firm, the area controlled by the Islamic State went from 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015 to 6,759 square kilometers in January 2018. That’s a 93 percent reduction in territory, which is pretty close to 100 percent.  But Trump’s emphasis on the one-year time frame and territory ""just recently held"" by the Islamic State pushes his claim a bit. If that means since he took office, then the Islamic State’s losses are closer to 89 percent. The success Trump described built upon strategy and attacks launched under President Barack Obama. The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to U.S. Air Force Central Command data, coalition forces engaged the enemy over 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and November 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.) Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three fourths of the action took place during the Obama years. The Air Force reports over 104,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. About two-thirds of that came before Trump took office. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact in January that Trump devolved more authority to the tactical level on the battlefield, which sped up U.S. operations and produced ""a real shift … that contributed to ISIS's precipitous collapse in mid 2017."" Trump said that after one year, coalition forces had freed almost 100 percent of the territory just recently held by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. According to data from a private defense and security group, the Islamic State controls 93 percent less terrority today than it did at the start of 2015, and 89 percent less since Trump took office. The fight against the Islamic State began two years before Trump became commander in chief, and the radical militant group saw significant territorial losses by the end of 2016.

Does it take 10 years to get a permit to build a road, as Donald Trump said?
","President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address repeated a long-standing complaint about how excessive bureaucratic red tape holds up the construction of federal projects. In championing a regulatory rollback, Trump noted that the regulatory burden has grown heavier with time. ""America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year,"" he said. ""Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?"" We decided to look at how long it took to build the Empire State building, and the length of the current permitting process. How long did it take to build the Empire State Building? A historical timeline from the Empire State Realty Trust states that construction began on March 17, 1930. The building was finished one year and 45 days later. So Trump is close in terms of the year-long timeline of construction he gave. However, we were unable to find how long the permitting process took, and the Empire State Realty Trust doesn’t offer any clues. It notes only that several parties formed Empire State, Inc. in 1929, and name Alfred E. Smith, a former governor of New York, to head the corporation. It’s unclear whether or when they applied for a permit. According to the lead infrastructure aide on the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality, the permitting process for how the government builds roads, bridges, rails and pipelines is now an average of under five years. The Wall Street Journal quoted Alexander Herrgott telling a Washington conference in January that he hopes the administration will ""take permit delivery times from what is now an average of 4.7 years down to two years."" That 4.7 year figure also appeared in a 2015 study by the law firm Arnold & Porter into the government permitting process. The firm found that the average length of an infrastructure project — from the beginning with a governmental environmental study until its completion — spanned 4.7 years. A 2014 Government Accountability Office study, citing third-party estimates, put the average at 4.6 years. However, a study commissioned by the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama found the average time to complete an environmental review was longer than 4.7 years in 2015 — and that duration has grown through recent decades. It cited studies conducted for the Federal Highway Administration, which found the time increased from 2.2 years in the 1970s, to 4.4 years in the 1980s, to 5.1 years in the 1995 to 2001 period, to 6.6 years in 2011. Yet another study, by a pro-deregulation group called Common Good, says infrastructure often takes 10 years to be approved. But according to the Wall Street Journal, ""Outside experts say actual review times vary widely based on the scope of a project and other environmental factors."" Among the timeframes described in various studies, Trump is picking the high end. It bears repeating that his own White House aide to the Council on Environmental Quality said the average was 4.7 years. The White House also did not provide an example of a ""minor permit"" for a ""simple road"" taking 10 years. Trump said, ""America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for a simple road?"" The Empire State Building was constructed in one year and 45 days — which means that part of Trump’s claim was pretty close. Recent government studies say the permit approval time ranges from 4.6 to 6.6 years. The only study we found that claims a 10-year approval is common comes from a pro-deregulation group, which raises questions about its reliability.

Is U.S. 'finally seeing rising wages,' as Donald Trump said?
","President Donald Trump touted economic achievements on his watch during his State of the Union address. One of the statistics he cited was wage growth. ""After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages,"" Trump said. However, that’s problematic in two ways. We asked Jed Kolko, the chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com, for the best measure to use, and he said it was median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, 16 years and over. This is a measure that tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment and it is adjusted for inflation. This figure has been calculated quarterly since 1979. Here’s the full run of the data: This data shows that after Trump entered office, wages initially went up, then fell. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the figure was $345. That’s slightly below the $349 mark in the fourth quarter of 2016, before Trump entered office. Even if you allow for some quarterly blips, however, Trump’s statement is also misleading in another way. The ""years of wage stagnation"" he refers to didn’t end with Trump’s presidency -- wage growth began under President Barack Obama. Wages hit their post-Great Recession low in the second quarter of 2014, at $330. They climbed, with just a few blips, for the rest of his presidency. When we asked the White House for data, they said, incorrectly, that the most recent data was from the third quarter of 2017. The White House also offered another statistic: average real weekly earnings of all private-sector employees. For this statistic, wages have indeed risen since Trump has been in office — by less than 1 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. But here, too, wages rose over the equivalent periods of time in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, in one case by as much as 2 percent over the course of a year. So it’s incorrect to say the United States is ""finally"" seeing wage increases. Our ruling Trump said, ""After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages."" By the most common measure, wages did go up for the first three quarters of Trump’s presidency, but they fell in the fourth, wiping out all the gains on his watch and then some. And even if you ignore this fourth quarter figure as a blip, his assertion ignores that wages — by two different measurements — began their climb during the final years of Obama’s presidency.

Donald Trump leaves out the facts in claim about visa lottery

Trump said his administration presented a four-pillar proposal ""that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise."" ""The third pillar ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people,"" Trump said Jan. 30. Trump mischaracterized the program. He failed to note that individuals who come to the United States through the lottery program must be vetted by the United States and also must meet certain education and work criteria. The White House did not respond to our request for comment on the record. Here are the facts. The visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States’ immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at 50,000 per fiscal year. It’s worth noting that entries chosen in the lottery do not automatically get a visa, they only become eligible to apply for it. Applicants must meet education or work experience requirements, according to the U.S. State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: • At least a high school education or its equivalent, defined as successful completion of a 12-year course of formal elementary and secondary education; or • Two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform. Visa lottery applicants can include a spouse and children in their application. While only the applicant has to meet the education and work requirement, all potential travelers must be thoroughly vetted by the United States. Applicants who pass a vetting process are awarded the diversity visa. Information reviewed in the vetting process includes passport, police and medical records, photographs, English translations of documents, and education or work experience credentials. ""No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies,"" a State Department official previously told us. ""National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications,"" the agency added. Trump said the visa lottery program ""randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people.""

Donald Trump says tax bill led to bonuses for 3 million workers
","President Donald Trump said the tax bill passed in December has already led to millions of workers getting bonuses. ""Since we passed tax cuts, over 3 million workers have gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars,"" Trump said during the State of the Union Jan. 30. In December, Trump signed a bill into law that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. Trump’s numbers echo the finding of a conservative group that had compiled company announcements about bonuses, but the majority of companies’ bonuses appeared to be $1,000 or less, not the ""thousands and thousands"" Trump said. Trump’s numbers match a compilation by Americans for Tax Reform, a group started by anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist. Americans for Tax Reform advocates against tax increases and supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Trump signed into law in December. Americans for Tax Reform used company press releases and media reports to compile a list of announced bonuses or other financial benefits. The group found that as of the day of Trump’s State of the Union speech, at least 3 million Americans are receiving special tax reform bonuses. American Airlines, FedEx, Home Depot, Nationwide Insurance, Walmart and Walt Disney Company were among the companies that announced bonuses. In total, at least 286 companies have announced wage and salary increases, bonuses, or 401(k) match increases, or in the case of public utility companies, lower rates. Trump said that ""many"" of the bonuses are ""thousands of dollars per worker.""  But it appears that the majority of the company announcements were for bonuses of $1,000 or less. The list includes about nine companies that announced bonuses of $2,000, including Fiat Chrysler’s 60,000 employees. Some companies were very clear about who deserves credit for the bonus. The Hammock Source in North Carolina was one of many companies to announce employee bonuses following the passage of the tax bill. The company handed out the bonuses in envelopes that said, ""Trump Republican tax reform bonus."" ""We at The Hammock Source want to continue to invest in the people that have made our business successful,"" CEO Walter Perkins III said in a press release Jan. 25. ""President Trump’s tax cuts will provide the funds to make this desire a reality. We hope that other business will follow our lead and give back to their employees as well."" The Americans for Tax Reform analysis was only of recent bonus announcements and did not include a historical comparison to determine how many of these companies gave bonuses in recent years. It’s not unusual for many companies to give bonuses. Experts say that Trump’s claim is lacking important context. The bonuses only affect a small percentage of American workers. Willis Towers Watson, a global human resources consulting firm, surveyed 333 large and midsize employers in January to ask about their plans related to the tax bill. The survey showed that about 6 percent said they provided profit sharing or a bonus in 2017 and 5 percent planned to do so in 2018, while 10 percent were considering it. A slightly smaller number had given wage increases or planned to do so. A Reuters/Ipsos poll showed 2 percent of U.S. adults said they had gotten a raise, bonus or other additional benefits due to the tax law. The poll was conducted of 5,254 adults Jan. 12-23. Economists say it will take more time to fully assess the economic impact of the tax reform bill. Labor trend experts said that amid a tightening labor market and low unemployment, companies have been trying to use different compensation and rewards to attract and retain top talent. Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor, told PolitiFact that one-time bonuses are a low-risk way for companies to pass on some expected benefits of the tax bill to workers without being on the hook for sustained higher base wages. ""In this hiring environment, plans for pay increases are likely to have already been in the works, and the passage of the recent tax bill may simply have been the occasion for announcement rather than the cause,"" he said. The news coverage following the new tax policy may have led some employers to announce pay or benefit changes in an effort to stay ahead of competitors. ""This is not to say the tax bill hasn’t affected recent decisions to raise wages at all, but the full impact of tax reform on the job market is something that we’ll only know in time – years or even a decade from now,"" Chamberlain said. Brian Kropp, HR practice leader at Gartner, an information technology research and advisory company, told PolitiFact that companies have been trying to use different compensation and rewards to attract and retain top talent. ""While, it is true that some companies have used the tax cut to provide bonuses for employees, the majority of companies had already been increasing, or planning to increase rewards, well before the tax cut,"" he said. Companies announcing bonuses by the end of 2017 do get a tax advantage of claiming a deduction in that tax year, Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center co-director Eric Toder told PolitiFact. ""A payment in 2017 would be deductible at a 35 percent rate; the same payment in 2018 would be deductible only at the new 21 percent rate,"" Toder said. ""My understanding is companies would only have had to announce the bonus by the end of 2017 to claim the deduction in tax year 2017; they would not literally have had to send out the checks."" Any surge in bonus payments now probably says little or nothing about how the corporate tax cuts will affect wages in the long-run, Toder said.   Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute who favored the corporate tax changes in the bill, said that the response from corporations was a surprise. ""Taxes matter to businesses, and they respond,"" he said. However, bonuses are a short-term response to the tax bill, which is less important than potential long-term changes, such as whether corporations will build new factories or purchase more machinery. Trump said, ""Since we passed tax cuts, over 3 million workers have gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars."" Americans for Tax Reform, a group that supported the tax reform bill, found that at least 3 million Americans are receiving bonuses that the companies said were related to passage of the tax bill, based on company press releases and news reports. However, economists and labor experts say it will take years to fully assess the economic impact of the tax bill. In this tight labor market, it’s possible that some businesses were already planning to give out bonuses or other financial incentives to retain workers.

Donald Trump wrong again that recent tax bill is biggest ever

""We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history,"" Trump said in his address. Measuring the size of the tax cut is a straightforward task. And as we noted the last time we fact-checked a similar claim, the tax bill passed last December doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever. On the eve of its passage, the Joint Committee on Taxation — Congress’s nonpartisan arbiter of tax analysis — said the tax bill would cost about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or about $150 billion a year. How does that compare historically? The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy). Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut from 1921, not included in the Treasury Department analysis, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP. The group added in a blog post that ""if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years.""

However, as we also noted, the African-American unemployment rate didn’t exactly turn on a dime once Trump took office. Black unemployment peaked at 16.6 percent in April 2010, after a historic recession and when Barack Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 percent by the time Obama left office in January 2017. More to the point, as we’ve noted in regard to presidents of both parties, presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters. Broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's Analytics, said that while the jury remains out on his long-term record, Trump does deserve some credit for overall economic growth on his watch. In the tweet, Lafakis said, Trump ""is likely suggesting that his policies have boosted the overall economy, which has helped black people as well as whites. This is the only thing I can think of him referring to, since he hasn’t undertaken any initiatives solely designed to benefit blacks."" Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, agreed that he ""cannot think of any specific policy under President Trump that has especially aided African-American workers or job seekers."" Trump can ""legitimately argue that his stewardship has contributed to, or at least not detracted from, the good economic news of the past 12 months,"" Burtless said. But beyond that, any specific link to African-Americans’ economic fortunes is speculative, he said. ""Higher stock prices and improved investor confidence may fuel higher investment in the United States and better job growth in the future, helping African-Americans as well as all other workers, but that remains to be seen,"" he said. The White House told PolitiFact that even though the decline began on Obama’s watch, Trump has kept the momentum going. Our ruling Trump said that ""because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!"" While African-American unemployment rates are indeed at record lows, Trump’s ability to take credit is uncertain. The rate has fallen with ski-slope consistency since about 2010, six years before Trump took office. And economists have always been skeptical about the ability of presidents to take either credit or blame for conditions on their watch, since many other factors play into economic results. Trump has taken no specific actions aimed at lowering the unemployment rate for African-Americans.

"['Ohio', 'Wealth', 'Taxes', 'Richard Cordray']","
Richard Cordray mostly on point comparing taxes paid by corporations versus individuals
","Richard Cordray, a Democrat running for governor in Ohio who served under the Obama administration, described the tax bill as a ""terrible deal"" that helps the wealthy. Cordray is one of many competing in the Democratic primary with hopes to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. John Kasich. In a speech to the City Club of Cleveland Dec. 14, Cordray told the audience about his efforts to help consumers and fight big banks while serving as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. When an audience member asked Cordray to weigh in on the federal tax bill that was in the works at the time (it later became law), he said it wouldn’t do enough to help the middle class. ""If you go back and look 50 years ago, individuals paid about 7 percent of the total and corporations paid 5 percent. Fast forward 50 years: individuals still 7 percent, corporations (are) down to 2 percent. And yet we are making (it) a priority to give more tax cuts to corporations. There’s slabs for them, there’s crumbs for people like the middle-class people in our society. I think it is wrong."" Cordray spokesman Mike Gwin told PolitiFact that Cordray was referring to corporate and individual income tax revenue as a share of U.S. gross domestic product, which wasn’t fully clear from Corday’s comments. We fact-checked Cordray’s historical comparison and found that he was in the ballpark, but his comment required further explanation about how businesses actually end up filing their taxes. The tax bill signed by President Donald Trump in December will significantly reduce the on-the-books corporate tax rate. The top corporate rate will fall from 35 percent to 21 percent, and the business version of the alternative minimum tax will be repealed. Gwin cited a 2017 chart by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that shows tax receipts as a percentage of GDP dating back to 1934. The chart is based on historical tables from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Gwin said Cordray’s point wasn’t to make comparisons between individual years such as 1967 and 2017 since the numbers fluctuate from year to year, but to make a larger point that over the last 50 years individuals have contributed an increasing share of overall tax revenue, while corporations have paid a decreasing share. Since Cordray mentioned looking back 50 years, we will use 1967 and 2017 as our comparison years, though it wouldn’t change dramatically if we looked at different years in that general range. In 1967, individual income taxes accounted for 7.3 percent of gross domestic product while corporate income taxes accounted for 4.1 percent. The center’s estimate for 2017 shows that individual income taxes now represent a larger share -- 9.3 percent -- while the corporate share has fallen to 2.2 percent. Joel Slemrod, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, said the comparison is broadly accurate -- however, to get to the 5 percent for the corporate tax that Cordray cited would require going back a bit further than 50 years, to 1954. He also said that Cordray’s numbers only apply to federal taxes. Since the United States has had a high corporate tax rate, millions of mid-sized businesses that would have paid the corporate tax have instead used alternative structures to lower their taxes. That resulted in a huge amount of business income shifting from corporations to so-called pass-through entities, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""If you look at data the past couple of decades there has been a huge rise in LLCs"" and other such entities, Edwards said. ""About half of all business income in the U.S. is those pass-through entities that don’t pay the corporate income tax -- they pay through the individual income tax code."" The business-backed Tax Foundation compiled data showing the decrease in the number of corporations subject to the corporate income tax and the increase in S corporations paying the individual income tax. Between 1980 and 2012, the number of corporations subject to the corporate income tax fell from 2.2 million to 1.6 million. Meanwhile, the number of S corporations subject to the individual income tax increased from 0.5 million to 4.2 million, with the number of non-corporate businesses increasing dramatically as well, said Scott Greenberg, senior analyst at the Foundation. In 2012, pass-through businesses earned $1.63 trillion in net income, compared to $1.10 trillion of net income earned by C corporations -- the traditional kind of corporation that pays corporate taxes. ""As a result, focusing on the corporate income tax, as an indicator for how much American businesses (or even American corporations) are paying in taxes, can be quite misleading,"" Greenberg said. ""Because many businesses have switched away from the C corporate form, and are now taxed under the individual income tax, the comparison between corporate income tax revenue 50 years ago and today is not quite apples-to-apples."" Cordray said in a speech, ""If you go back and look 50 years ago, individuals paid about 7 percent of the total and corporations paid 5 percent. Fast forward 50 years: individuals still 7 percent, corporations (are) down to 2 percent."" He was referring to taxes paid as a percentage of GDP, which wasn’t clear from his remarks. And, a growing portion of the individual income tax figure he cites was effectively taxes paid by businesses as ""pass-throughs"" on individual tax filings. Overall, though, his numbers are in the ballpark.

"['Ethics', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
How hands off has Rauner been with his investments?
","Details contained in a lawsuit brought against Gov. Bruce Rauner by a former business associate have called into further question the governor’s insistence that he no longer plays a role in his business investments. Appearing before the Chicago Tribune’s editorial board Monday, Rauner was asked to address an account from former associate Harreld ""Kip"" Kirkpatrick III describing how the two discussed the business investment on which Kirkpatrick’s case centers. ""No private business was conducted on public property,"" Rauner told the Tribune during a mini-debate with his rival in the March Republican primary, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton. ""That issue is a contract dispute, contract dispute. It’s not an investment decision. A contract dispute that stemmed from before I was governor."" Pressed on whether he spoke with Kirkpatrick at all about that dispute, the governor doubled down: ""I was not doing private business on state property,"" he said. ""It’s not an investment decision, it’s not about making investments. Not about assets."" Kirkpatrick’s lawsuit was filed last October under court seal, an unusual move that kept its allegations hidden from public view. At the time, Rauner told reporters he had nothing to do with the lawsuit because he had signed ""blind trust commitments"" before taking office that ceded control of his investments to a New York investment house. We fact-checked that claim at the time, rating it Half True. Despite the name Rauner used, he hadn’t really set up a blind trust that would have prevented him from managing his money. Rauner instead signed a power of attorney in which the governor retained the authority to handle his investments along with the New York firm. But the issue flared again in recent days after a Cook County judge removed the lawsuit seal, revealing that Kirkpatrick claimed he and Rauner were fighting over how to divvy up a $67.5 million settlement pot involving a separate legal dispute tied to an investment both had stakes in. In the lawsuit, Kirkpatrick claimed he met twice with Rauner in 2015 to discuss their differences, including once on the back porch of the governor’s mansion in Springfield. So if Kirkpatrick’s version of events is correct, how then can Rauner claim he has been hands-off with his investments? We decided to take a closer look. The particulars of the investment spat between Rauner and Kirkpatrick are only peripheral to the credibility questions raised by Rauner’s actions. What is central is an action taken by Rauner just days before he assumed office in 2015 aimed at easing public concerns that his vast wealth might conflict with his actions as governor. Back then, Rauner, a multimillionaire private equity investor, announced that he had entered into ""blind trust commitments"" in which he authorized a New York investment house to handle his financial affairs. The move came against the backdrop of his refusal to release detailed tax records that could clearly show how his money was handled. The name Rauner gave that instrument was somewhat misleading. He did not enter into a blind trust, which would have required him to cede control over his investments to a third party. Instead, what Rauner did was sign a power of attorney in which Rauner retained the authority to manage his investments along with the New York firm. When Kirkpatrick filed his lawsuit in October, Rauner invoked his blind trust commitments to suggest the legal action, including the sealing of the court file, was not his doing and he knew little about it. We rated that Half True because the power of attorney he signed did not preclude him from involvement and, with the file sealed, there was no way to check his claim. But when the file was unsealed recently, pieces of Rauner’s story began to unravel. For instance, Rauner insisted in October that he was not behind the push to keep the case allegations sealed and out of view. But filings from Kirkpatrick’s lawyers contradict that claim. They contend that the governor invoked a confidentiality provision in a business agreement with Kirkpatrick to request that the complaint be filed under seal. What’s more, a report by The Associated Press confirmed one part of the allegations leveled by Kirkpatrick: Rauner’s state-paid scheduler had arranged a meeting between the governor and Kirkpatrick on May 11, 2015, at the executive mansion in Springfield. Rauner spokeswoman Rachel Bold did not respond directly when we reached out to the governor’s office last week to clarify whether he still denied speaking with Kirkpatrick or whether he simply disputed Kirkpatrick’s account of their meeting. ""This is a contract dispute that stems from before Governor Rauner took office,"" she wrote in an email. ""The governor is seeking to enforce the terms of that contract. Court filings dispute Mr. Kirkpatrick’s allegations, including his characterizations of any conversations."" Bold added that the governor ""is not involved in day-to-day investment decisions."" She responded almost word-for-word again Monday when we reached out for clarification following Rauner’s remarks at the Tribune. Rauner said, ""No private business was conducted on public property."" At its core, the question raised by the lawsuit against Rauner is simple to address. He has claimed from his first days as governor that he would have no involvement in managing an investment portfolio worth hundreds of millions of dollars to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Kirkpatrick’s lawsuit contends Rauner violated that pledge. In defending himself, Rauner has appeared evasive and is now attempting to parse the difference between personal involvement with an investment and personal involvement with a contract dispute stemming from an investment. It is a distinction without a difference. Rauner is being disingenuous and obtuse, and we rate his statement as False.",/factchecks/2018/jan/30/bruce-rauner/how-hands-has-rauner-been-his-investments/

Conservative group claims new law would require people to throw away existing light bulbs and replace with more efficient ones
","
A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs.

The letter, circulated by AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates, claims President Barack Obama is ""banning"" incandescent light bulbs in favor of compact fluorescent lighting. It includes a lengthy letter purported to be written by Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund.

""A silly little light bulb is merely a small piece of the larger puzzle of global socialism that he feels is his agenda to enslave the American people -- and to choke Americans from a free enterprise system!"" the letter states.

The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

We're writing about several claims in the letter, but here, we wanted to set the record straight on one of its worst inaccuracies.

""Next year your light bulbs will be obsolete,"" the letter reads. ""You will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs.""

A few paragraphs later, the letter hits on the same idea, stating, ""Next year you will be required to trade in -- whoops...throw away...your trusty incandescent light bulbs so you will supposedly be 'environmentally-safe' with much more expensive Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs).""

Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards for light bulbs, essentially requiring them to be 25 percent more efficient. The idea is that, over time, more efficient light bulbs will replace older, less efficient ones.

But there is nothing in the bill that requires you to get rid of the light bulbs you've got. Rather, the bill sets standards for new light bulbs ""manufactured or imported"" to the United States.

Just to be sure, we asked Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, who said, ""The standards apply to bulbs being imported or manufactured after the standards go into effect."" Not only can people keep using their existing bulbs, she said, stores can continue to sell the old ones -- even after the new standards are in place -- until they are sold out.

""There are no energy police coming to your home to make you remove your light bulbs,"" scoffed Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

We asked Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund, who is purported to have penned the letter, about the claim.

Initially, Arnold told us ""that's probably not a very good way to put that. I could have been more careful with that.""

Then he said he didn't recall including such a phrase in his letter at all.

When we sent him a copy of the letter we received, he said it was ""an earlier version that was sent out by AmeriPAC, which had no reason to believe it was wrong in any part.""

Arnold attached another version of the letter, the one he said CDFE sent out, and it words the claim a little more carefully: ""Democrats in Congress have mandated that you must give up using traditional light bulbs all because environmentalists believed that traditional light bulbs caused global warming.""

But we're fact-checking the earlier version from AmeriPAC because it was widely circulated and spread even further via chain e-mail. The claim that next year, ""you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs,"" has no basis in fact. It amounts to a manufactured, baseless charge, and we rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/may/20/chain-email/conservative-group-claims-new-law-would-require-pe/

Conservative PAC claims Democrats banned incandescent light bulbs in favor of fluorescent light bulbs
","
A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs.

""The Democrats have already voted to BAN our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of DANGEROUS fluorescent light bulbs,"" writes Alan Gottlieb, chairman of AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates.

The letter then invites people to read a letter from the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund.

""By outlawing incandescent lights in favor of compact fluorescent lighting, the environmentalists said the country would reduce energy consumption by $18 billion a year, or save consumers between $80 to $180 on their electric bills per year,"" the letter states. ""The plus for the globalists? They said it would reduce global warming because one of the causes of global warming is...you guessed it...the old fashioned Tom Edison light bulb.""

The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

""Help put an end to governmental interference in our lives! Help put an end to Mr. Obama interfering with free enterprise!"" the letter urges, referring to President Barack Obama.

We are checking several claims from these light bulb letters, and in this one, we will tackle the central claim that, ""Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs.""

First off, it's not accurate to pin the law entirely to Democrats. It's true that more Democrats than Republicans voted for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. But it got a measure of bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 264-163 vote (with 36 Republicans voting in favor). And in the Senate, the vote was 65-27 (with 20 votes in favor from Republicans). And it was signed by Republican President George W. Bush. We also explore the issue of whether fluorescent bulbs release ""dangerous"" amounts of mercury into the environment in a separate fact-check. 

But the bigger issue here is the claim that the bill bans incandescent light bulbs.

Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards, essentially requiring that light bulbs be 25 percent more efficient than they are now. Specifically, a 100 watt light bulb is to be replaced with a bulb using no more than 72 watts of electricity while still providing comparable light output. The 75-watt, 60-watt and 40-watt bulbs must be replaced by bulbs using no more than 53, 43 and 29 watts respectively. The law phased in the new requirements: first the replacements for the 100-watt bulbs by Jan. 1, 2012; followed by the lower watt bulbs in ensuing years.

The curlicue compact fluorescent bulbs and LED light bulbs easily meet the new efficiency standards. But we couldn't find any language in the law that specifically bans incandescent bulbs.

So we asked Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund to back up the claim that the law ""outlaws"" incandescent light bulbs.

Arnold said the bill is filled with vague and confusing language and that there is a de facto ban because the standards are so stringent that no manufacturers will be able to build incandescent bulbs that meet them.

""We believe 'ban' is an accurate term because there is no such thing as what they require,"" Arnold said.

""If it's available, where can I buy it?"" he asked.  ""Why doesn't Home Depot carry them?""

Actually, they do, said Randy Moorhead, VP of government affairs at Philips Electronics, one of the three major manufacturers of light bulbs in the U.S.

Philips' new EcoVantage bulb, a halogen incandescent light bulb that runs on 72 watts but throws off as much light as a standard 100 watt bulb (and lasts just as long), shipped out to Home Depot in April, he said. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs more, but lasts three times longer. Both bulbs are more expensive than the current 100 watt incandescent bulbs, but they more than pay for themselves in savings on electricity to power them (more on that in another fact-check).

The two other big players in the industry, Osram Sylvania and GE, have also developed new halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards. But for those, you'll have to head to Lowe's. 
Moorhead said industry representatives were closely involved in the legislative process to develop the new efficiency standards and would never have supported a ban of incandescent bulbs. The companies, as well as the legislators who drafted the bill, were keenly aware that the new standards could be met through the development of halogen incandescent light bulbs, he said.  
""You don't have to buy fluorescent bulbs,"" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said the claims about a ban on incandescent light bulbs are simply wrong. 
""It doesn't ban a specific type of light bulb,"" she said. 
This one is a clear call for us. It's true that the current versions of incandescent light bulbs will be phased out of existence. Compact fluorescent and LED bulbs offer more efficient alternatives, but if incandescent light is your thing, the major light bulb makers have you covered. They have developed and shipped halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards, so there is no basis in fact to claim they have been banned in favor of fluorescent bulbs.

Cuccinelli says DOE officials never visited Virginia Tech while investigating shootings
","
Announcing Virginia Tech’s appeal of a fine linked to the 2007 massacre there, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli took the U.S. Department of Education to task in late April, calling its investigation and decision ""appalling.""

After a four-year probe into the tragedy -- in which student Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and wounded 25 before taking his own life -- the DOE fined Tech $55,000 for failing to issue a timely warning during the shootings and not following school policies.  

The penalty is the stiffest allowable under the federal Clery Act, which requires rapid reporting of crimes on college campuses. But officials also sharply rebuked the school, writing ""Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute.""

Cuccinelli plans to appeal the fine. In a scathing written response, the Republican took exception to the department’s ruling and painted the investigation as shoddy.

""It is not just that federal bureaucrats are engaging in Monday-morning quarterbacking — it is that they have had four years’ worth of Monday mornings,"" Cuccinelli said in a news release. ""Yet, in all that time, they have not once gotten into the car and driven down to Blacksburg to talk to the police chief or the university president or to anyone else who had to deal with these events in real-time. Their investigation — if you can call it that — appears deeply flawed, and their indifference to the facts on the ground is shocking.""

Is it true that no department officials visited the scene of the massacre before reaching their decision? We decided to check.

Asked how the attorney general came to make such a claim, spokesman Brian Gottstein said that University Counsel Kay Heidbreder was the only member of the school’s policy group to speak who to anyone from DOE.  

""It was over the phone and DOE did not visit the campus or speak to anyone else,"" Gottstein said in an email. ""All Kay and the DOE representative discussed were procedural investigative issues.  He asked no questions about what happened [on April 16, 2007].""

The easiest way to get started was to ask the Department of Education if anyone had visited Blacksburg during the investigation. We did that on April 29. Two weeks later, after asking a second time, we got a response.

""We had several conversations, interviews and email exchanges with school officials in the process of conducting this review, and there were numerous opportunities throughout the process for Virginia Tech to provide input – most notably as the school did in its official 72-page response to our draft report,"" wrote Sara Gast, a spokeswoman with the DOE.  

""The lines of communication were certainly open, and they had multiple chances to respond and communicate with us throughout the entire process. However, because of the sensitive and legal nature of the proceedings, we did not meet with officials face-to-face,"" she added.

Called for comment, Virginia Tech spokesman Larry Hincker said that school officials did contribute to the report submitted to the DOE, but added that they were never asked to be interviewed or even submitted questions relating to the incident.   

We should note that a state commission investigating the shootings interviewed 34 Tech officials before releasing a 2007 report that also concluded the university failed to issue a timely campus alert about the violence, which occurred over 2-1/2 hours. Virginia reached an $11 million settlement with many of the victims’ families. Two families have filed a $10 million suit against Tech officials that is scheduled for trial this fall.

Let’s review.

Cuccinelli said DOE officials never visited Virginia Tech while probing the university’s response during the 2007 shootings that left 32 dead. He said the DOE investigators never conducted face-to-face interviews with the Tech officials making decisions that dreadful day.

A DOE spokeswoman acknowledged both points, although she said it did not taint the examination. She said there was plenty of communication via email and telephone.

We’ll let others debate Cuccinelli’s opinion on the integrity of DOE’s probe. But his claim that DOE investigators never visited Tech to conduct interviews is True.",/factchecks/2011/may/20/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-doe-officials-never-visited-virgin/

Deal uses wrong number to make case about childhood obesity
","
Georgia’s weight problem is making us lighter in the wallet.

And we’re not just talking about the adults.

Gov. Nathan Deal last week went to an intermediate school in White County to talk about his plans for a statewide initiative to battle childhood obesity. Not only did the governor speak to students about the health concerns that come with obesity, Deal also mentioned its financial impact.

""The health care price tag for childhood obesity in Georgia is $2.4 billion annually and rising,"" Deal said, according to the Gainesville Times.

Atlanta Braves president John Schuerholz, who is also involved in the effort, led by the SHAPE Partnership, used the same cost estimate for childhood obesity in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed. The SHAPE Partnership is a public-private partnership that includes several state agencies.

Considering these austere times for Georgia families and state government, we thought it worthwhile to dig deeper into the $2.4 billion estimate.

Deal’s office sent us a 2009 report on obesity in Georgia to back up the governor’s point. It mentioned that obesity costs the Peach State about $2.4 billion a year. However, that did not specify children. The report mentioned that the average cost in medical care for the obese is $250 a year.

We called the authors of that report. One of them, Justin Trogdon, said the average annual medical cost for children is $200. He did not have a specific total for how many obese children there are in Georgia. Trogdon said the $200 estimate comes from examining annual medical spending for obese people and comparing it with non-obese people. The estimate includes out-of-pocket costs and other expenses.

The annual cost for children is less than adults because they face fewer health problems, said Trogdon, a research economist at RTI International, an institute that does studies on topics that include health, education, the environment and technology for businesses and governments in more than 40 countries. Researchers are noticing more cases of high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes among children, Trogdon said.

""A lot of the expensive issues don’t manifest until later in life,"" Trogdon said.

Nearly 22 percent of Georgia’s children between the ages of 10 and 17 are obese, according to one study sent to us by Deal’s office. The U.S. Census Bureau does not keep specific data on how many children in Georgia are between 10 and 17, but it does mention that nearly 7.2 million of Georgia’s 9,687,653 residents are 18 or older. That leaves us with about 2.4 million Georgians younger than 18.

We did some more math using that census estimate to determine the percentage of children considered obese and the $200 annual medical cost estimate to see how close that came to what the governor told those students. The total was about $110 million. Not close to $2.4 billion.

Was our estimate wrong? We talked about it with Deal’s office. His communications director, Brian Robinson, said the governor misspoke.

""The figures he offered are for obesity overall,"" Robinson said, noting the $2.4 billion annual medical care estimate for all obese Georgians mentioned in the 2009 Georgia study.  

""His overall point is accurate,"" Robinson added. ""Obesity comes at a high cost to our state and Governor Deal wants to give children a chance to learn about healthy living and engage in healthy living practices.""

The $2.4 billion estimate was used by various Georgia news organizations and mentioned to students. We appreciate the efforts of the governor’s office to clarify the estimate. Still, it was the wrong estimate and rates the claim False.",/factchecks/2011/may/20/nathan-deal/deal-uses-wrong-number-make-case-about-childhood-o/

Rodney Ellis says lawmakers have voted to “spend virtually all of the Rainy Day Fund four times"" in history
","
Appealing unsuccessfully to spend more money from the state’s so-called Rainy Day Fund, state Sen. Rodney Ellis hearkened to legislative history, saying in floor debate May 16: ""Members, this legislature has voted to use virtually all of the Rainy Day Fund four times"" since its creation in the late 1980s. ""The sad truth is that Texans and the (fund) are being held hostage to politics.""

Back story: GOP Gov. Rick Perry has said he’s agreeable with taking about $3.1 billion from the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, to help cover the state budget that runs through August. But Perry and many Republicans oppose tapping the fund, which is fed by state oil and gas oil production taxes, for the 2012-13 budget. Perry contends it needs to be protected in case of natural disasters.

Democrats, noting the projected multi-billion-dollar shortfall in state revenue needed to maintain current programs, say the current dire circumstances justify taking more from the fund.

And is Ellis correct about past legislatures voting four times to virtually empty the fund?

Jeremy Warren, Ellis’s spokesman, said the senator relied on a report by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank that advocates for programs serving the poor. To help balance the 2012-13 budget, the center has urged lawmakers to use the fund, which is projected by State Comptroller Susan Combs to have a balance of $9.7 billion by the end of August 2013, or about $6.6 billion if lawmakers stick with applying $3.1 billion from the fund to this year’s deficit .

The center’s Feb. 21 report says: ""In 1991, the Legislature spent the fund’s entire balance ($28.8
million) on public schools, and in 1993, spent the entire balance ($197 million) for criminal justice.

""In 2003, to deal with the last economic downturn, the Legislature appropriated $1.3 billion from the Rainy Day Fund—almost every penny of the balance the (state) comptroller forecast through 2005,"" the report says.

Nancy Pelosi posts questionable chart on debt accumulation by Barack Obama, predecessors
","A reader recently pointed us to a post on the website of MoveOn.org, a liberal group. The post features a bar graph titled, ""Who Increased the Debt?"" that offers figures for the past five presidents:

Ronald Reagan: Up 189 percent
George H.W. Bush: Up 55 percent
Bill Clinton: Up 37 percent
George W. Bush: Up 115 percent
Barack Obama: Up 16 percent

We can see why a liberal group would tout such numbers, since -- if accurate -- they offer powerful counterevidence to the claims by conservatives that President Barack Obama has been a spendthrift who’s set the nation on an unsustainable fiscal path.

But the reader who sent it to us was surprised to see the debt increase under Obama was so small. So we decided to check the numbers.

The chart actually comes from a Flickr page belonging to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who posted it on May 5, 2011. Specifically, the chart tracks ""percent increase in public debt"" for the five presidents during the following time periods -- January 1981 to January 1989 (Reagan), January 1989 to January 1993 (George H.W. Bush), January 1993 to January 2001 (Clinton), January 2001 to January 2009 (George W. Bush), and January 2009 to April 2011 (Obama).

We checked with Pelosi’s office to see what data they used to assemble the chart. They referred us to the U.S. Treasury’s ""Debt to the Penny Calculator.""

First, we should note that we interpreted the caption in Pelosi’s chart that reads ""percent increase in public debt"" to mean public debt, not gross federal debt. Public debt is debt held by the public, whereas gross federal debt includes both publicly held debt and debt held by the government, such as money in the Social Security trust fund.

Despite what the chart’s label suggested, the data we received from Pelosi’s office made clear that they had been using the gross federal debt number. So we’ll start with that figure.

We can quickly dispense with the figures for Reagan and George H.W. Bush. The ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator doesn’t go back further than 1993, but we were able to estimate the figures for debt under Reagan and the elder Bush by using data from the Office of Management and Budget. OMB’s numbers are calculated somewhat differently than Treasury’s, but the percentage increases were close enough to what the chart said that we’re not going to quibble over them. OMB has debt under Reagan increasing by 186 percent (the chart had said 189 percent) and by 54 percent under George H.W. Bush (compared to the 55 percent in the chart).

Instead, we’ll focus on the numbers for Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama.

From the online calculator, we requested the daily debt totals since 1993 and picked out the ones closest to the inauguration dates of those three presidents, as well as the end of the month of April 2011. Here’s what we came with for gross federal debt:

January 20, 1993 (end of George H.W. Bush and beginning of Clinton): $4.188 trillion
January 19, 2001 (end of Clinton and beginning of George W. Bush): $5.728 trillion
January 20, 2009 (end of George W. Bush and beginning of Obama): $10.627 trillion
April 29, 2011 (closing date of the chart): $14.288 trillion

This allows us to determine how much the debt rose under each president:

Under Clinton: Increase of $1.54 trillion, or 37 percent
Under George W. Bush: Increase of $4.899 trillion, or 86 percent
Under Obama: Increase of $3.661 trillion, or 34 percent

So we can dispense with Clinton -- in the chart, his figure is correct. But the chart is significantly off for both Bush and Obama. We found Bush to have an 86 percent increase, not 115 percent as the chart said. And we found the debt under Obama to be up by 34 percent, more than double the 16 percent cited in the chart.

We quickly discovered the source of the discrepancy: Whoever put the chart together used the date for Jan. 20, 2010 -- which is exactly one year to the day after Obama was sworn in -- rather than his actual inauguration date. We know this because Treasury says the debt for Jan. 20, 2010, was $12.327 trillion, which is the exact number cited on the supporting document that Pelosi’s office gave us.

However this error happened, it effectively took one year of rapidly escalating debt out of Obama’s column and put it into Bush’s, significantly skewing the numbers.

Using the corrected figures does mean that, superficially at least, Democrats have a point. The debt did still increase more, on a percentage basis, under Bush than it did under Obama. But other problems with the chart and its methodology undercut even this conclusion.

• Time ranges: Bush served a full eight-year term, while Obama had served just 27 months by the time the chart was compiled. If the Obama figure were to be scaled out to a full eight-year period, he’d have a debt increase of 121 percent rather than 34 percent, making his increase greater than Bush’s. To be fair, that would be a simplistic exercise -- but no less misleading than the chart.

• Public debt vs. gross debt: Not only did the chart say it was using one statistic and then use another, it also cherry-picked the one that showed the comparison in a more favorable light. According to OMB statistics, public debt rose by 70 percent under Bush, 16 percentage points more slowly than gross federal debt did. And according to the Treasury, the public debt rose by 53 percent under Obama, compared with the 34 percent rise in gross federal debt.

Those numbers would have shown the two presidents much closer in their debt creation records -- and that’s without even adjusting for the vastly different lengths of time in office.

• Debt vs. debt as a percentage of GDP: Some economists will tell you that it’s not the size of the debt per se, but rather the size of the debt relative to the nation’s gross domestic product. This helps minimize the complicating effect of economic cycles and inflation. So how do those numbers stack up? Using OMB statistics, here’s what we came up with, using public debt figures not adjusted for the president’s time in office:

Reagan: Up 14.9 percentage points
George H.W. Bush: Up 7.1 percentage points
Clinton: Down 13.4 percentage points
George W. Bush: Up 5.6 percentage points
Obama: Up 21.9 percentage points (through December 2010 only)

So by this measurement -- potentially a more important one -- Obama is the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents, rather than the guy who added a piddling amount to the debt, as Pelosi’s chart suggested. Of course, all this goes to show that statistics can be used -- and misused -- to bolster almost any argument. After we presented our research to Pelosi's office, a spokesman acknowledged that the office had erred in assembling and posting the chart and that it was in the process of reposting it. The updated version – which corrects the mathematical error but not what we consider to be the three additional design flaws – can be found here. That's a step in the right direction, but it doesn't change our rating since it only occurred as a result of our fact-checking. We find so much wrong with this chart that we don’t think it contains any significant approximation of the truth. It made a major calculation error that dramatically skewed the debt increase away from Obama and toward George W. Bush. It glossed over significant variations in time served in office. It cherry-picked the measurement that was favorable to its cause. And it is contradicted by statistics for GDP-adjusted debt, which show Obama to be the most, rather than the least, debt-creating president of the last five. None of this suggests that Obama can’t turn things around as the economy improves (and Democrats can also take some solace in the fact that Bill Clinton did remarkably well in all of our measurements). But in communicating which administrations contributed the most to growth of the debt, this chart is a failure. We rate it Pants on Fire.  ",/factchecks/2011/may/19/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-posts-questionable-chart-debt-accumul/

I will defend and I will be glad to answer any Democrat who attempts to distort what I said. And I made a simple mistake.""

-- Interview on Fox News Channel’s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, May 17, 2011

***

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., made a splash when he officially entered the 2012 presidential race in mid May. But it wasn’t exactly the splash he was looking for.

In addition to a testy exchange with an Iowa voter that was caught on video, a glitter attack by a gay-rights protester, revelations that he had owed a six-figure amount to the luxury retailer Tiffany’s and a series of articles questioning the accuracy of his facts, Gingrich also took heat from conservatives for an alleged flip-flop on whether he supported the budget plan written by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and passed by the GOP-controlled House.

Ryan’s budget includes aggressive spending cuts that have energized conservatives, and changes to Medicare that have outraged liberals. Support for Ryan’s plan has become something of a litmus test for Republicans, especially those running for the GOP presidential nomination. So Gingrich’s stance on the plan was bound to become an issue.

Gingrich’s views on Ryan’s proposal have indeed varied over time -- and they’ve also been somewhat more nuanced than the popular reaction would indicate.

In a Facebook post on March 17, 2010, Gingrich wrote favorably of Ryan’s previous plan, known as the ""Roadmap."" The ""Roadmap"" is broadly similar to the budget resolution passed earlier this year by the House, including in its approach to Medicare.

Gingrich’s post called Ryan’s proposal ""a comprehensive, bold solution to America’s serious problem of rapidly rising debt. CBO scores the Roadmap reforms as achieving full solvency for Social Security and Medicare and eliminating all long term federal deficits, balancing the federal budget for the long haul. … I know Congressman Ryan remains committed to improving the quality of life for all Americans, both now and in the future, and this Roadmap represents a comprehensive way to achieve that.""

More than a year later, Gingrich told Time magazine reporter Jay Newton Small that he would have voted for Ryan’s latest plan if he’d been serving in the House.

Pressed on whether it would ""actually save the health care system,"" Gingrich responded, ""No, I think it’s the first step. You need an entirely new set of solutions.""

In other words, Gingrich indicated that the plan was worth voting for but added that it was not a silver bullet.

A few days after that, in comments at the Brookings Institution on April 23, 2011, Gingrich once again praised Ryan’s big-picture thinking but added that ""there are details (of the plan) I disagree with."" According to an account in the Daily Caller, one of his reservations involved ""cutting investment in science and research.""

Reductions in science funding envisioned under Ryan’s plan are ""essentially like saying I want to save money on your car, we’re not going to change the oil. And for about a year I can get away with it. And then the engine will freeze up, and we’ll have to replace your engine. But if I have a CBO that scores oil but doesn’t score engines, I can annually replace the engine for free, because it won’t count as a budget cost.""

This seems to reinforce a view that Gingrich supported the proposal, but not without qualifications.

Then came the Meet the Press interview on May 15, 2011.

Host David Gregory asked Gingrich, ""Do you think that Republicans ought to buck the public opposition and really move forward to completely change Medicare, turn it into a voucher program where you give seniors … some premium support and -- so that they can go out and buy private insurance?""

Gingrich responded, ""I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate.""

After explaining his desire to instead cut waste and abuse, Gingrich insisted that ""there are things you can do to improve Medicare.""

""But not what Paul Ryan is suggesting, which is completely changing Medicare?"" Gregory suggested.

Gingrich said, ""I, I think that, I think, I think that that is too big a jump. I think what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better outcomes, better solutions, better options, not one where you suddenly impose upon the -- I don't want to -- I'm against Obamacare, which is imposing radical change, and I would be against a conservative imposing radical change.""

While Gingrich didn’t explicitly tell Gregory, ""I wouldn’t have voted for the Ryan proposal,"" his stance seems pretty clear to us -- that he did not favor the Ryan Medicare overhaul. So we think it’s fair to say that, after the Meet the Press interview, Gingrich had at the very least done a half-flip on the question of whether to implement the Ryan proposal.

But that wasn’t the end of it.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page the day after the Meet the Press appearance, Gingrich backtracked somewhat. He said he had ""probably used too strong language"" on the show, though he added, ""I have thought about this for a long time and I am very, very worried. … I think it would be politically catastrophic to pass the bill in its current form,"" at a moment when conservatives have an opportunity ""to break the left for the first time since 1932.""

So Gingrich indicated to the Wall Street Journal that he’d overstated his view, but still thought that it would be ""politically catastrophic to pass the bill in its current form.""

Yet there was more to come.

As a wave of criticism built, mostly from conservatives outraged at his failure to fully back Ryan’s proposal, Gingrich went on Fox News Channel’s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren on May 17, 2011, to extend and clarify his remarks. 
""I made a mistake,"" Gingrich said. ""And I called Paul Ryan today, who's a very close personal friend and I said that. The fact is that I have supported what Ryan has tried to do on the budget. The fact is that my newsletter strongly praised the budget when he brought it out. And the budget vote is one that I'm happy to say I would have voted for. I will defend and I will be glad to answer any Democrat who attempts to distort what I said. And I made a simple mistake. ...

""So, let me say on the record: Any ad which quotes what I said Sunday is a falsehood and because I have said publicly, those words were inaccurate and unfortunate. And I'm prepared to stand up -- when I make a mistake, and I'm going to on occasion, I want to stand up and share with the American people, that was a mistake, because that way, we can have an honest conversation.""

In other words, Gingrich used the appearance with Van Susteren to back away from any suggestion that he would have voted against the Ryan plan.

As we indicated, a close reading of the Meet the Press transcript shows that Gingrich never precisely said that he would have voted against the Ryan plan. But he certainly made clear that he thought a key provision of the plan -- the changes to Medicare -- were ""too big a jump"" for him to support. And by saying on Van Susteren’s show that he ""made a mistake"" in his Meet the Press comments -- a big enough mistake that he felt a need to call Ryan and smooth things over -- it seems like a tacit admission of a flip-flop.

We do think that, taken as a whole, there has been more nuance to Gingrich’s stance than some of the coverage has indicated. But his philosophical travels -- from the full-throated Facebook endorsement in 2010, to qualified endorsements in the Time interview and at the Brookings conference, to the downbeat assessment on Meet the Press, to the hasty re-endorsement on Van Susteren’s show -- indicate that Gingrich’s support for the Ryan proposal has ebbed and flowed over time.

Gingrich seems to have gone full circle in his views on the proposal, and it qualifies in our book as a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2011/may/18/newt-gingrich/did-newt-gingrich-flip-flop-supporting-paul-ryans-/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says Barack Obama wants a top tax rate of 44.8 percent
","
Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- the author of a budget plan that won approval from the Republican-held House but which was assailed by Democrats because it proposes significant changes in how Medicare works -- gave a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago on May 16, 2011. In it, he criticized President Barack Obama on tax policy.

Ryan said that his own budget plan makes ""the tax code simpler, flatter, fairer, more globally competitive and less burdensome for working families and small businesses. By contrast, the president says he wants to eliminate deductions, but he also wants to raise rates. That includes raising the top rate to 44.8 percent. That would amount to a $1.5 trillion tax increase on families and job creators.""

A reader e-mailed us to ask whether the president really wants to raise rates to 44.8 percent, since the most widely discussed Obama tax proposal is to reinstate marginal income tax rates that were in effect for the wealthiest taxpayers before approval of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts proposed by President George W. Bush. As the reader pointed out, Obama’s proposal to let Bush’s tax cuts lapse would raise the top marginal income tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent -- not to the 44.8 percent that Ryan cited.

We began by asking Ryan’s staff what he had meant by using that figure. Spokesman Conor Sweeney forwarded us a document that provided the reasoning that Ryan used to get to the 44.8 percent.

Here’s the relevant portion of that document:

Top statutory rate, 2010: 35 percent
Expiration of 2001/2003 lower rates, 2011: 39.6 percent
PEP/Pease provisions reinstated, 2011: 41.6 percent
Net 2.3 percent Medicare tax on wages/salary: 43.9 percent
0.9 percent nondeductible Medicare tax, 2013: 44.8 percent

We’ve already discussed the references to the 35 percent and 39.6 percent figures. Here’s a rundown of the rest:

• PEP/Pease. These are two caps on how much income is subject to taxation for wealthy Americans. (Most Americans do not earn enough to trigger them.) The first, the ""personal exemption phase-out,"" limits the benefit of the personal exemption for taxpayers earning above a set amount of income. The second sets a similar cap for itemized deductions. The two taxes were steadily reduced under the Bush tax cuts, disappearing entirely for 2010. The two caps are set to be revived in 2012, like the rest of the Bush tax cuts, unless Congress and the president agree to  intervene.

Ryan’s staff and tax experts we consulted with disagreed somewhat over how big a hit the PEP and Pease revivals would be, but their estimates ranged from about 1 to 2 added percentage points. So on the low end of that scale, Ryan’s estimate is slightly high, but the difference is modest.

• Medicare taxes. Currently, the Medicare tax is 2.9 percent, split evenly between the employee and the employer. The new health care law would add a 0.9 percent, nondeductible tax to the employee’s side, so the new total is 3.8 percent, of which 2.35 percent is borne by the employee and 1.45 percent by the employer. To that employee share, Ryan added almost a percentage point to account for what he sees as lower employee salaries due to the employer’s share of the payroll tax. On balance, Ryan estimates the combined net increase from Medicare taxes to be 3.2 percent.

So for Medicare taxes as well, Ryan’s staff made some assumptions that would be open to critique. But once again, the range of possible rate increases is fairly small -- about one percentage point.

So even if you don’t buy Ryan’s assumptions, the most he’d be off in his final number is about 2 percentage points.

Now, how about the way Ryan described his number?

Usually, we’ve seen politicians use the term ""the top rate"" to refer to the marginal income tax rate for the highest tax bracket, not that tax rate plus several other taxes. So, one could say that using the 44.8 percent figure is a subtle way of adding an extra 5.2 percentage points to Obama’s tax proposal, making it look more draconian.

But when we asked both liberal and conservative economists what they thought about Ryan’s phrasing, most were largely untroubled.

""For non-tax people, I suppose he could have specified that 44.8 would be the combined marginal tax rate, though it's not clear that would have helped the average person understand,"" said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Short of engaging in lengthy digressions, I'm not sure what Ryan could have done differently.""

If Ryan had used a specific definition of the tax rates in his speech, such as ""the effective marginal income tax rate,"" then ""that would be misleading,"" added J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. But he didn’t, Foster said, and that gives him some space to define what he means.

Dean Baker, a liberal economist, said he’d ""give Ryan a pass on this."" Ryan left out that most of the rates listed in the document would be reverting to prior levels, rather than being imposed for the first time by Obama, Baker said. However, on balance, Baker said he feels that Ryan’s statement ""is largely true.""

So where does this leave us? On Ryan’s number, it’s possible to argue that the actual rate is as low as 42.8 percent rather than 44.8 percent, but that’s open to debate. On his description of what the number means, Ryan -- particularly given that he was working from a prepared speech -- could have been clearer by saying something like, ""The various parts of Obama’s tax agenda would together push the highest marginal tax rate up to 44.8 percent.""

Still, the figure Ryan used is close to what the tax rate would be if Obama’s agenda is followed, and a cross-section of economists we asked thought that Ryan’s presentation of that number was reasonable. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/may/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-barack-obama-wants-top-tax-rate-448/

State Sen. Terry Moulton says Wisconsin is one of the few states that does not require photo ID to vote
","
As the Wisconsin Legislature took up a strict photo ID requirement for voting, Republicans responded to concerns that the bill was one of the most restrictive in the United States. 
Most didn't dispute that fact, saying it was a necessary anti-fraud measure. We previously rated as True a claim from Milwaukee Ald. Milele Coggs that ""In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation."" 
Republicans did, however, make several changes that put in doubt whether it's still the most restrictive, or just one of the most restrictive. 
But in the weeks before the state Assembly approved the amended measure May 11, at least one photo ID backer in the state Senate put Wisconsin’s status in a totally different light. (The Senate was poised to give final approval to the bill on May 19, 2011.)

State Sen. Terry Moulton, R-Chippewa Falls, answered constituent concerns with a letter that made this claim:

""Wisconsin is one of the few states in the country that do not currently require a photographic identification.""

We heard from two Moulton constituents -- Gail Halmstad of Chippewa Falls and Jim Dunning of Eau Claire -- who said they received those Moulton letters between late March and mid-April. Both said they question the need for a photo ID mandate at the polls.

Others, including state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, have made similar statements.

""I think most people just want to get the issue off the table and say, yeah, we should have an ID in order to vote. Most states have an ID for voting,"" Darling told a WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) reporter for a May 11, 2011 story.

Darling didn’t say ""photo"" ID, so her statement can’t be equated with that of Moulton. But that’s what the bill requires and what she supports, so her comment may have left the impression with viewers that she meant most states have photo ID for voting.

Moulton’s statement was simple and straightforward.

So is our evaluation, since we have been down this road before.

The definitive source for up-to-date information on state-by-state requirements for voter identification is the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures’ online guide, ""Voter Identification Requirements.""

So is it true that Wisconsin is one of the few states that lacks a photo ID rule for voting?

Actually, it’s the opposite.

Only eight states currently request or require a photo ID to vote, according to the group.

A ninth state, Kansas, will require photo ID as of 2012, we found. (The Wisconsin law would take effect in 2012 as well, barring a court injunction.)

Another 18 states require some form of identification, but it does not have to include a picture.

That tally will move to 19 in July 2011 when Oklahoma election officials begin requesting photo ID, according to the group.

These numbers could change more in the months ahead. According to Brennan Center for Justice research, 37 states including Wisconsin are considering or have considered voter ID and/or proof of citizenship legislation in recent months.

But currently Wisconsin is in a very large group of states that do not require photo ID to vote -- not ""one of the few"" who do not. Most states do not ask or mandate photo ID.

Moulton’s office told us they inadvertently erred in the constituent letter and have omitted the claim in letters that have gone out recently. Elise Nelson, an aide to Moulton, gave us a copy of the revised letter she said went out on May 10, and it does not include the earlier claim.

But it does not correct it either, so recipients may still have the impression the earlier claim is fact.

Nelson said she did not know where Moulton’s office came up with the original claim.

The bottom line?

As Wisconsin was on the verge of enacting a photo ID requirement for voting, Moulton said the state was one of only a few without one. But as senators prepared to cast their final vote, most states still do not require photo ID to vote.

Moulton’s claim to constituents, as his office notes, was well off target.

We rate it False.",/factchecks/2011/may/18/terry-moulton/state-sen-terry-moulton-says-wisconsin-one-few-sta/
"['State Budget', 'Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
Terry McAuliffe says Virginia has no repayment plan for its new transportation debt
","
Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who is considering a bid for Virginia governor in 2013, says a road-building plan passed by the General Assembly this winter is paved with peril.

The former chairman of the Democratic National Committee helped launch the reelection campaign of Del. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, at a May 7 rally. During introductory remarks, McAuliffe criticized a plan to borrow $1.8 billion for transportation that Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell pushed through the legislature.

""The $1.8 billion in borrowing, we didn’t even have a repayment mechanism, folks,"" McAuliffe said.

A major borrowing plan with no way to repay the money? Is that really what the state did?

We decided to check.

A transportation plan to borrow up to $300 million a year for 10 years was approved in 2007. But the recession and legal challenges delayed issuance of the first bonds until May, 2010.

What McDonnell and the General Assembly did this winter was accelerate the sale of those previously authorized bonds so that $600 million annually could be sold during the next three years. John Lawson, chief financial officer for the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the state still plans to issue the full $3 billion in bonds, but in a shorter period of time.

Both McDonnell and Democrat Tim Kaine, who signed the 2007 plan, offered the same repayment plan.

The 2007 bill directed that one-third of the state’s revenue from insurance premium taxes be set aside to pay the debt. That portion roughly equals the fraction of annual receipts from insurance premium taxes that come from vehicle policies.

McAuliffe told us he knows the state has a repayment plan. He said he was ""rhetorically"" arguing  the state lacks a plan to pay back the debt because he does not think politicians set up ""a realistic repayment mechanism.""

He told us in an email that the state is ""doubling"" the amount of debt issued, but in reality, Virginia is issuing the same amount of debt in half the time.

McAuliffe also said he is concerned that one-third of the revenues from the tax on insurance premiums won’t cover the state’s new borrowing for roads. He said tax receipts from premiums fell below projections in 2009 and 2010.  

Ric Brown, the state’s secretary of finance under Kaine and McDonnell, told us that one-third of the insurance tax will net about $131 million for the 2011 budget year that ends June 30. That’s up from $128 million in 2010, Brown said.

Proceeds from the insurance tax proceeds make up about 85 percent of the Priority Transportation Fund, the state’s repository for revenues to pay off road bonds. The coffer also receives money from a state tax on the wholesale price of gas that is paid by service station owners, as well as interest on its cash balances.

All told, Virginia saw $152.2 million in revenues flow into the fund during the 2010 budget year and $154.5 million is expected this year, according a briefing by Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton to the House Appropriations Committee in January. Connaughton and Brown both say the fund will take in enough money each year to pay back the accelerated loan.

Between 2011 and 2017 the state expects to deposit annual revenues of about $224.8 million in the fund. The average debt payment during those years is expected to be about $175.7 million. Those forecasts give the state plenty of leeway, even if actual revenues fall short of the projections.  

Let’s review.

Terry McAuliffe said Virginia is taking on $1.8 billion in transportation debt without any plan for paying it back. He’s wrong. The General Assembly in 2007 set aside one-third of the proceeds from the tax on insurance premiums to pay off the debt. Taxes on wholesale gasoline also go towards the bond payments.
All told, the state has set aside yearly revenues to repay the loan that are 28 percent higher than projected borrowing costs.

McAuliffe is not the first Democrat to make this claim. State party chairman Brian Moran earned a Pants on Fire in January for saying the McDonnell had no plan for paying back the debt. Moran, while serving in the House of Delegates, had voted for the two bills that allocated automobile insurance taxes to transportation debt payments.

By saying the state ""didn’t have a repayment mechanism,"" McAuliffe misled voters. He admitted to us he knew all long that a repayment plan exists.

Wisconsin tea party leader says Democrat-hired telemarketer called recall petition signers
","
Kim Simac, a Wisconsin tea party leader, took aim at state Sen. Jim Holperin after the Conover Democrat fled to Illinois in February 2011.

Like 13 other Democratic senators, Holperin, who represents a North Woods district where Simac lives, spent three weeks in Illinois. The move delayed a vote on Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill, which curtails the collective bargaining power of most state and local government employees, although the bill eventually became law.

Court challenges have kept the collective bargaining changes from taking effect. But the law, and the Democrats’ reaction to it, spurred a recall movement of historic proportions. Campaigns were launched against all 16 state senators -- eight Democrats and eight Republicans  -- who were eligible to be recalled.

Simac, vice-chairwoman of the Vilas County Republican Party and founder of Christian values group called Northwoods Patriots, headed the signature-collecting campaign to recall Holperin, a first-term senator who previously served 10 years in the state Assembly.

On April 21, 2011, Simac submitted some 23,000 signatures to the Government Accountability Board, which has not completed its review. She has announced plans to run against Holperin if a recall election is set.

Eight days after the petitions were filed, Simac issued a news release that claimed petition signers, ""are being subjected to harassing phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers claiming to represent the Democratic Party and insinuating foul play by petition circulators.""

Let’s see if that’s what happened.

When we asked Simac for evidence to back her claim, she asked people who received the calls to contact PolitiFact Wisconsin directly.

We received calls from 17 people and e-mails from more than 30 others. We interviewed 10 of the people who called. Here’s what we found: 
Those statements back the claim made by Simac.

What did Holperin and the Democrats have to say about it?

Holperin said he authorized the Wisconsin Democratic Party to call about 5,000 of the people who signed recall petitions against him.

Graeme Zielinski, spokesman for the party, said the Minnesota telemarketing firm was hired to call people who signed petitions against Holperin and against two other Democrats who are facing possible recall elections.

Holperin said he authorized the calls because, although petition circulators who worked under Simac were ""earnest, honest and friendly,"" more than a third of the 23,000 signatures were collected by Kennedy Enterprises, a Colorado marketing and consulting firm hired by the Wisconsin Republican Party. Those petition circulators were often aggressive and misleading when they asked residents to sign petitions, Holperin said.

According to Holperin, 534 petition signers -- about 10 percent of those who were called by the Minnesota telemarketing firm -- said they were given misleading information and that they asked to have their names removed from the petitions. He said that was the basis for a complaint he filed with the Government Accountability Board challenging the petitions.

Holperin provided a script that he said the firm used in asking questions of people who signed recall petitions against him. The script shows that, among other things, callers were to: identify themselves as representing the Wisconsin Democratic Party; ask people whether they were aware their signatures appeared on a Holperin recall petition; and state that reports had been received that ""out-of-state paid circulators were misleading people about what they were being asked to sign.""

""So, did we ‘insinuate’ that foul play had occurred?,"" Holperin said. ""You bet we did, and we think we offered ample evidence that backs up our claim.""

Let’s wrap up.

Simac said people who signed Holperin recall petitions received ""harassing phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers claiming to represent the Democratic Party and insinuating foul play by petition circulators.""

Some people who received calls said they felt harassed even if they received just one call because they didn’t expect to be questioned about signing a petition. The callers were employed by an out-of-state firm, they did identify themselves as representing the Wisconsin Democratic Party and did claim that petition circulators misled signers of the petitions.

We rate Simac’s claim as True.

State Rep. Jay Goyal says new Kasich budget plan uses more federal dollars than last budget
","
A long-running debate at the Statehouse has focused on the role that federal stimulus money played in former Gov. Ted Strickland’s last state budget.

From the day it was first introduced in February 2009, Republicans ripped Strickland’s budget for relying on billions in federal stimulus dollars to help Ohio shore its state budget.

The now-absent federal stimulus dollars are the chief reason, Republicans have long argued, that they are now forced to make gouging cuts in education and local government funds to keep the next state budget in balance.

House Democrats tried to turn the tables on that GOP argument during the seven-hour-long floor debate May 5, 2011, over the next state budget. They did so by noting that the state budget proposed by Republican Gov. John Kasich actually had more federal dollars in it then the one crafted by Democrats in 2009.

""I think it’s important to note that even accounting for the federal stimulus dollars, there are more federal dollars in this biennial than there are federal dollars in the previous biennial budget,"" said Rep. Jay Goyal, a Mansfield lawmaker. ""I think that’s an important fact to note.""

House Republicans immediately jumped on Goyal’s statement with Rep. Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, even invoking PolitiFact Ohio saying that should be awarded a Pants on Fire rating.

Does it?

House Democratic Caucus spokeswoman Melissa Fazekas pulled some numbers from Strickland’s current state budget, which runs through June 30, as well as Kasich’s proposal for the next state budget.

The House Democratic numbers — taken from the state budget summary put together by the Office of Budget and Management under Kasich — show a total of $6.9 billion in federal dollars in 2010 and $8.2 billion in 2011 deposited into Ohio’s general revenue fund. That’s a total of $15.1 billion in federal dollars over both years of Strickland’s budget.

Meanwhile, Kasich’s proposed budget for 2012-13 relies on $7.55 billion in 2012 and $8.49 billion in 2013. That’s a total of $16.04 billion — or about $940 million more than what Strickland had to used in his budget, according to the chart Democrats relied upon.

So Goyal’s right? Not so fast.

The chart on which House Democrats relied only compares the federal dollars in the state’s general revenue fund in both budgets.

And while that’s the usual place where federal dollars end up in state budgets, Strickland’s budget director Pari Sabety moved portions of the state’s Medicaid program ""off-budget"" in 2009, so not all the federal money went into the state’s general revenue fund.

In fact, a state budget document titled ""estimated one-time revenue source"" prepared by the Strickland administration has a notation marked ""footnote D"" concerning a pot of federal money known as enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP. Basically, federal officials decided to reimburse states at a higher rate for Medicare and Medicaid costs than they normally do—picking up 73 cents of every dollar spent on medical care instead of the usual rate of 64 cents.

The footnote explains that only a small portion of that enhanced FMAP money was funneled into the state’s general revenue fund. ""Under budget framework, an additional $1.3 billion in FY 2010 and $590 million in FY 2011 is deposited into non-GRF funds,"" the footnote says.

Put simply, there was nearly $1.9 billion in federal dollars in the last budget beyond what was in Ohio’s general revenue fund.

And that’s not all. That’s because federal officials added even more money to the enhanced FMAP program in September 2010—about $293 million funneled ""off-budget"" which was ladled out to Ohio hospitals, mental health providers and drug assistance for HIV positive patients as well as the state departments of aging and mental health.

Add this to our previous pile of federal money and you have about $17.3 billion in federal dollars that flowed into Ohio in the last budget cycle -- roughly $1.26 billion more than the budget proposed by Kasich.

Goyal’s statement did contain some element of truth, but the phrase he used was ""more federal dollars"" which should include all of the money coming from the federal government, not just funds flowing into the GRF. Not including the Medicaid dollars ignores a critical fact that would give the listener a different impression.

On the Truth-O-Meter, that mean’s Goyal’s statement rates as Barely True.

Beverage association says R.I. tax would increase sugary drink prices up to 50 percent
","
Taxes are on everyone's mind, especially in the wake of Gov. Lincoln Chafee's widely criticized proposal to impose a sales tax on previously exempt items. Now, the folks who bring us a wide variety of beverages are protesting a proposed new tax on sugar-flavored drinks.

In full-page newspaper advertisements, pamphlets and placards on store shelves, the American Beverage Association, an advocacy group representing the nonalcoholic beverage industry, is warning consumers that they are going to see an increase of up to 50 percent in the price of their favorite beverage.

For example, the placard we saw at a local Stop & Shop had a big red stop sign and the words: ""The new beverage tax will increase the cost of sodas, juice drinks, sports drinks, iced teas, and flavored water up to 50%.""

The claim left us thirsting for the truth, so we started making inquiries.

At issue are two identical bills in the state legislature -- one in the House (H5432), the other in the Senate (S2952). Both call for a tax of 1 cent per ounce on drinks with added sugar or high-calorie sweetener. Thus, a 20-ounce bottle of Pepsi would cost you an extra 20 cents. A 2-liter bottle of Mountain Dew would cost an additional 68 cents.

The potential revenue, estimated at $28 million per year, would not be used to help the cash-strapped state, at least as the legislation is now written. It would instead be given to the Health Department for anti-obesity programs.

The goal is to move consumers away from ""sugar-added beverages, which have no nutritional value and which have a tendency to contribute to a lot of health problems,"" said Steven DeToy, director of public and government affairs for the Rhode Island Medical Society, one of the groups pushing the legislation.

Nationwide, non-diet sodas make up about 70 percent of the $75 billion carbonated soft drink market in the U.S., according to John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they now account for half the added sugar in the U.S. diet.

Opponents say the tax would be one more burden to consumers, driving shoppers across state lines to buy their soda while doing little to reduce obesity.

To find out how much the proposed tax would raise prices, we went shopping.

We discovered that when it comes to the purchase of individual bottles and cans, the claim wasn't close to true. A 20-ounce bottle of Coke selling for $1.49 would increase in price by 13 percent, to $1.69. An 8-ounce can of Red Bull selling for $2.29 would cost $2.37, 4 percent more.

A dozen 12-ounce cans of soda priced at $6.19 per case, which we found at a Providence Rite Aid, would cost $7.63, and additional 23 percent.

But if you buy soda on sale and in volume, the percentage increase is greater.

For example, at Stop & Shop, you could get three of those 12-packs for $10 (or $3.34 per pack); in that case the price would increase to $4.78 per pack, or 43 percent more. If you bought a 2-liter bottle of Pepsi (68 ounces) as part of a 2-for-$3 promotion ($1.50 each), it would make each bottle cost $2.18, or adding 45 percent to the cost of each bottle.

And with a 3-liter bottle of Stop & Shop-brand root beer, selling at 4 for $5 (or $1.25 each), the tax would increase the per-bottle price to $2.26, or 81 percent more, even more that the beverage association warns.

So the increases are all over the scanner.

There's another problem with the American Beverage Association claim.

The legislation would tax only drinks to which sugar, high-fructose corn syrup or another high-calorie sweetener has been added. Diet sodas would be exempt. So would drinks with more than 50 percent fruit or vegetable juice. So would beverages you get from a soda fountain. A Coke at McDonald’s, unless it was in a bottle, would not carry the tax.

In its claim, the beverage association is ignoring those distinctions.

One reason may be that the wholesalers might cover the cost of the tax by spreading it out among all beverages. (They made that argument during a March 9 hearing before the House Finance Committee.) That means consumers would pay more for all types of drinks, healthy or otherwise.

However, if they adopted that practice, the overall increase to consumers would fall even further. The ""up to 50%"" claim, as tenuous as it is, would be even less accurate.

In summary, it is correct that if you were to buy a sugary drink on sale and in bulk, the added price could approach -- and in some cases exceed -- 50 percent because the tax would be levied on a per-ounce basis.

But for individual bottles and cans, the tax would typically be far lower -- 20 percent or less for a 20-ounce drink bought for 98 cents or more.

In addition, opponents of the bill are inaccurately implying that the increase would apply to all sodas, juice drinks, soft drinks, iced teas and flavored waters. That's not true; that's not how the bill is written.

And if the companies decided to jack up the prices for the diet drinks and all-natural fruit drinks that would be exempted from the tax, the beverage association's estimate of the potential price increases would be even less true.

By trying to have it both ways, the American Beverage Association is making a claim that is accurate but leaves out important details. So we rate its statement as Half True.

Nancy Pelosi says more jobs created in Obama's first year than eight years of George W. Bush
","
During a May 16, 2011, interview with Bloomberg television, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., praised President Barack Obama’s record on jobs while taking a shot at former President George W. Bush.

""We got in this situation where we had tax cuts for the wealthiest people in our country, which did not create jobs,"" she said. ""In the first year of the Obama administration, more jobs were created in the private-sector than in the eight years of the Bush administration, with all of the tax cuts that President Bush had.""

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy shed almost 4.2 million private-sector jobs during the first year of the Obama administration -- January 2009 through January 2010.

Meanwhile, during eight years under Bush, the economy gained a net 188,000 private sector jobs.

So while job growth under Bush was anemic by historical standards, it was still better than the 4.2 million jobs lost under Obama. That means Pelosi was wrong.

A Pelosi spokesman, Nadeam Elshami, told PolitiFact that Pelosi simply misstated a talking point that she’d used many times before. In one variation provided by her office, Pelosi sent out a news release that said in part, ""America has had 12 consecutive months of private-sector job gains totaling 1.5 million. That is more private-sector jobs than were added in the eight years of the Bush Administration.""

But when we checked a similar incarnation of this talking point, we only gave it a Half True -- technically correct, but misleading due to cherry picking.

Pelosi was right that the economy created 847,000 jobs during the period she indicated. But she would have been incorrect if she’d cited total employment rather than private-sector employment. And she chose her starting and ending dates in a way that was highly favorable to Obama and unfavorable to Bush. Pelosi essentially started counting from the low point for jobs and only counted the upward part of the trendline, while denying Bush the same method.

This time, in talking to Bloomberg TV, Pelosi didn’t even get the statistic technically correct. So we rate it False.",/factchecks/2011/may/17/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-more-jobs-created-obamas-first-y/

State senator claims school nurses can't give aspirin without parent's permission
","
In a show of Republican muscle, Florida lawmakers passed several bills relating to abortion during this year’s legislative session. 
One proposal awaiting the signature of Gov. Rick Scott requires young women who want a judge to waive the parental-notification requirement to obtain the waiver in a circuit court closer to their home rather than a wider-reaching appeals court. 
Opponents insist HB 1247 violates the privacy of young women who live in small communities and know most people in their area, including people who work at the courthouse. But supporters say it prevents teens from crossing the state to find a sympathetic judge in order to get an abortion without their parents’ knowledge. 
Sen. Steve Oelrich, a Republican from Gainesville and cosponsor of the Senate version, had an interesting take during a May 5, 2011, debate on the Senate floor. 
""You can’t give a child an aspirin in school without permission,"" he said. ""You can’t do any kind of medication, but we can secretly take the child off and have an abortion. We should support it (HB 1247) with all our hearts and souls if parental responsibility means anything to us."" 
Oelrich’s claim left us wondering: Is it really that hard for students to get over-the-counter medication at school? 
We should explain that we're not ruling on Oelrich's statement that young women can ""secretly"" have abortions. We already know this is legal in certain cases under Florida law. Implementation of HB 1247 would limit which courts can make the decisions for women who seek waivers of the parental notification law, not strip their ability to have secret procedures. 
Florida law 
The Florida Statutes have straightforward directions for handling prescription medication at school. The law requires a student’s parent to submit a written statement with the medicine that permits a trained school official to administer a dose. The note must also explain why the medicine must be taken during the school day. 
The prescription medicine must be administered at school by a qualified official and then be counted, stored in the original container, and kept in a secured place. 
Beyond that, the law does not address the use of over-the-counter medication. The statutes leave that decision up to local school districts. We set out to check each one to learn if Oelrich's claim is true. 
We tracked down policies for 62 of 67 counties. Most were available online. 
It took time to be sure, but Oelrich is right. Every district requires parental consent for non-prescription medication, sometimes in writing and sometimes by phone. 
Notifying a parent is the minimum step for many other districts, including Charlotte, Baker and Miami-Dade. These districts require a physician's note, too. 
""We don’t administer anything in Charlotte County without doctors' orders,"" said Gail Buck, supervisor of the county’s school health services. ""No cough drops, no Tylenol."" 
Aspirin warnings 
There's another part to this claim: Oelrich specifically invoked aspirin on the Senate floor. 
Some of the school nurses we interviewed practically shuddered at the word. 
The reason? Aspirin use among children is linked to the development of Reye's Syndrome, a lethal disease that sets in after a viral infection and affects all organs of the body, according to the National Reye's Syndrome Foundation. 
The National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are among entities that recommend not using aspirin, or combination medicine containing aspirin, for children under 19 during fever-causing illnesses. 
""We stay away from all aspirin products and stuff,"" said Catherine Reckenwald, student health specialist for Citrus County Schools. ""You don’t know if a child has an allergy, so you need to have very specific instructions for each student."" 
Reckenwald said Tylenol is more appropriate for children, but she does not keep a supply in her clinic. This is standard practice at most of the school health centers we contacted. 
""We do not have what is called 'standing orders,' "" said Janice Karst, St. Lucie County School Board director of communications. 
In case you were wondering, students are allowed to self-administer epinephrine auto-injectors, metered dose inhalers, pancreatic enzyme supplements and diabetic supplies if they have a doctor's note and parental consent. 
Our ruling 
The thrust of Oelrich's point is correct: You can’t give a child an aspirin in school without permission. To administer any non-prescription medication, school officials must have approval from the parent. And in some cases, the schools also need a note from a doctor -- even for cough drops. While Oelrich is right about the permission part, he specifically mentioned aspirin so we should add that giving aspirin to children is considered risky because of the medicine's connection to a deadly disease. But that wasn't exactly Oelrich's point in a debate over abortion and a minor's right to privacy. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2011/may/17/steve-oelrich/state-senator-claims-school-nurses-cant-give-aspir/

Ohio Democratic Party Chair Chris Redfern says donations from labor a small percentage of party's fundraising
","
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern and his GOP counterpart Kevin DeWine sparred recently during WCPN’s Sound of Ideas radio program in Cleveland.

Both are former legislators, young, brash and well-oiled talking-point machines who frequently appear together to defend their respective politics and candidates.

Controversial Senate Bill 5, the new law that overhauls the state’s collective bargaining rules for some 360,000 public employees, drove the discussion at several points on the May 4 program hosted by The Plain Dealer’s Tipoff columnist, Mike McIntyre.

Democrats and labor groups fiercely oppose the law and want to put it before voters in November. But a caller to the show who identified himself as a Democrat complained that the party is influenced too much by labor groups.

Not so, Redfern said.

""Over the course of the last six months, for instance, the Ohio Democratic Party has raised $1.1 million since the November election. A very small percentage of that has come from organized labor.""

Given PolitiFact Ohio’s weakness for a political boast, especially one that includes a statistic – we decided to take a closer look.

Redfern’s reference to the last six months coincides with the current election cycle, which began when the books closed on fundraising for the Nov. 2, 2010, election.

PolitiFact Ohio asked for an accounting of the $1.1 million and the union contributions because political donations are not reported publicly in real time and parties typically have several accounts.

Party spokesman Seth Bringman said the money was raised this calendar year; that after the November election, fundraising didn’t get underway in earnest until after the December holidays.

The party raised $383,191 this year for its federal campaign account, which is used when the party promotes a candidate running for federal office, such as the U.S. Senate, Bringman said. The Federal Elections Commission requires the party to submit monthly reports on contributions to the federal account. PolitiFact checked the party’s claims against FEC records and found the figure accurate.

The party raised another $477,901 for its state account, as detailed in its ""pre-primary"" report filed in April with the Ohio Secretary of State, Bringman said. The report shows the party raised $455,281. The slight difference is a result of refund and other accounting issues required by the state. For the analysis, PolitiFact Ohio is using the figure reported to the state.

PolitiFact Ohio verified $858,472 through records. Bringman said the remaining money – about $242,000 --will be detailed in forthcoming reports. We’re taking him at his word, since the figure will be easily verifiable once reports are filed.

Next we looked to see what percentage of the money raised came from labor groups.

Bringman provided a list of contributions from labor organizations received this year. The contributions, which include $25,000 from the Ohio Education Association, total $66,645.

That translates to about 6 percent of the total raised this year.

PolitiFact Ohio matched these labor donations to the state report. Bringman insisted that the forthcoming reports detailing the remaining $140,000 will not show any additional labor-group money.

We also evaluated whether the money raised from labor over the last six-month reflects what the Democratic Party typically draws from labor. Is the figure an anomaly that works to Redfern’s advantage in responding to the caller?

On the radio program, Redfern went on to say that ""our support, financially speaking, has been and will always be"" from individual donors, many of them who make small donations.

That comment drew a rebuke from DeWine, who said the amount of money labor groups contributed to Democrats in 2010 is ""staggering.""

The GOP chairman produced a spread sheet for us that showed $8.2 million in contributions from labor groups to 2010 Democratic candidates – including those running for the Ohio General Assembly and statewide offices — and to state and county Democratic parties. Bringman estimated that together the state party, statewide candidates, General Assembly candidates and county parties raised about $50 million in the 2010. The would mean union donations accounted for about 16 percent. 

So where does this leave Redfern’s statements on the Truth-o-Meter?

Campaign figures support his claim that that his party has raised $1.1 million since November. Unions contributed a bit under 7 percent of the total, which allows Redfern -- generously speaking -- to claim the it’s a ""very small percentage"" of what it raised so far.

One important caveat: The figures presented by both Democrats and the GOP only take into account money given to the Democratic Party and its candidates. But that doesn’t include any money spent directly by labor organizations on behalf of a candidate.

That’s a piece of additional information that provides clarification.

"['Georgia', 'Homeland Security', 'Janet Napolitano']","
Homeland security chief stresses that ""very, very, very few people"" get hands-on treatment at U.S. airports
","
As luck would have it, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had heaps of ornery subjects to tackle during a recent talk before the Atlanta Press Club.  

Attendees at the May 7 luncheon peppered her with questions about Osama bin Laden’s death, which took place just five days earlier. They asked about Georgia’s new immigration legislation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to recent, historic tornadoes that devastated towns across the Southeast.

One raised the touchiest -- literally -- of all of topics: getting patted down at the airport.

""Will we go past the grope-and-grab phase?"" a luncheon attendee asked Napolitano. ""The machines that scan the bodies and so forth? Are there better ways of doing it?""

""Well, actually, very, very, very few people get a pat-down,"" Napolitano replied. ""It’s only under very limited circumstances. They do, however, get -- those who are patted down -- tend to get on YouTube."" she quipped.

""And look, look, no one wants to see a 6-year-old patted down. Even if it’s done according to procedural protocol,"" she said. In April, a video was posted on YouTube.com of a 6-year-old girl being patted down at the New Orleans airport.

Just this week, images of a baby getting frisked at Kansas City International Airport made headlines as well.

""Very, very, very"" few people? we wondered. That’s a lot of ""very""s.

Given the public outcry, Napolitano’s estimate sent PolitiFact Georgia scribes scrambling.

We asked the Transportation Security Administration for more details. The TSA is part of the Department of Homeland Security and protects the nation’s transportation systems.

Last fall, the TSA began to use special scanners that showed images of passengers including what was underneath their clothing. Critics called it a ""virtual strip search"" and said it was too invasive.

The TSA offered pat-downs as an alternative, but these also frustrated critics. In October, the agency announced that officers would implement ""enhanced"" pat-down procedures. Previously, screeners used the backs of their hands to inspect sensitive areas. Now they use the front of their hands and conduct a more thorough search.

Adults can also receive pat-downs on a random basis. Children receive ""modified"" pat-downs if they require extra screening.

As the busy Thanksgiving travel week approached, passengers complained about having their genitals and breasts touched. A video appeared on YouTube.com of a toddler crying during the pat-down and shouting for a screener to stop. Parents were outraged. Travelers threatened they would stop flying, and some predicted long airport security lines.

The expected chaos never materialized. For the most part, passengers went through the screening process without a fuss.

""All in all, people wanted to get to their destinations,"" said Christopher Bidwell, a security expert with the industry group Airports Council International.

We asked the TSA how many pat-downs it conducts at the nation’s airports.

Atlanta TSA spokesman Jon Allen told us that during March, 3 percent of air passengers were subject to a pat-down. The TSA collects this data by monitoring ""data from select airports throughout the year,"" he wrote in an email. That number is ""consistent with that of previous time periods.""

PolitiFact Georgia looked for other pat-down data to see whether other groups have verified TSA numbers. Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union and passenger rights groups did not. Neither did industry groups we contacted.  

We did find a Gallup poll conducted Nov. 19-21 that said 15 percent of adults who have flown two or more times in the past year received a full-body pat-down. The survey’s margin of error was 4 percentage points. 

The 15 percent figure does not contradict the TSA figures. The more often you pass through a security checkpoint, the more chance you’ll receive a pat-down.

PolitiFact Georgia therefore took the TSA figures and did some math. The TSA’s Allen told us that ""on an average day, about 2 million people are screened at TSA checkpoints."" Three percent of 2 million is 60,000 people.

That means that over the course of a month, roughly 1.8 million people receive a pat-down. That’s more than four times the population of Atlanta.

That doesn’t sound like ""very, very, very"" few people to us.

If Napolitano said that ""a small percentage of passengers"" get patted down each month, she would have been correct. But she talked about ""people."" In addition, she used the superlative ""very"" three times, even though the TSA’s own figures show that the numbers of passengers who receive a pat-down can top 1 million in a single month.
