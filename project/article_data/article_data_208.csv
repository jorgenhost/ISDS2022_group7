Gillibrand's opponent claims she hasn't passed any bills while in office
","A New York Republican running for U.S. Senate says Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has served 11 years in Congress without passing a single bill into law. Chele Farley, a partner at a private equity firm in New York City, said Gillibrand’s political career has borne no legislative fruit. ""Kirsten Gillibrand has put forward 331 bills since she's been in Congress. Do you know how many of them have been passed into law? Zero!"" Farley said in an interview. Farley is staging a long shot bid to unseat Gillibrand in a state that hasn’t been represented by a Republican in the Senate for two decades. She believes Gillibrand hasn’t delivered on promises she made to improve the lives of New York state residents. Is it true that none of her bills has become law? Gillibrand’s bills Farley’s campaign supported the claim using information from the congressional bill tracking website. A search for Gillibrand’s legislation turned up 295 bills and 36 resolutions during her time in the House and Senate, according to a query on the website. Seven of those bills passed the chamber she was in at the time but none became law. Gillibrand was appointed to replace Hillary Clinton in the Senate in 2009, when Clinton became secretary of state. Gillibrand served in the House from 2007 until succeding Clinton in the Senate. She also co-sponsored 1,998 bills. That means she signed on to a bill introduced by another member of the chamber. Seventy-seven of those bills have become law. Some of them were from Gillibrand’s colleagues in New York state. She co-sponsored a bill with lower Hudson Valley Rep. Nita Lowey to promote breast cancer research, for example. Gillibrand has also offered 153 amendments to bills sponsored by other members. Twenty-one of those amendments were approved, with 11 were attached to bills that ultimately became law. The remaining 36 items Farley referred to are resolutions Gillibrand introduced. Resolutions are one-house actions that usually celebrate an occasion or change the chamber’s internal rules. They do not have to be agreed to in the other chamber. Gillibrand has introduced 36 resolutions in Congress and 23 of them passed. Gillibrand’s record In other ways, Gllibrand has driven new laws. She wrote part of the STOCK Act, a law designed to prevent insider trading by members of Congress. Her legislation was combined with another member’s bill and sponsored by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Sen. Joe Lieberman before it became law. Democrats have been the minority in the Senate since 2015. Minority members have a much harder time getting legislation passed because majority members decide which bills make it to the floor for a vote. Gillibrand has had more success adding amendments to other members’ bills and co-sponsoring legislation. Consider the Zadroga Act, legislation Gillibrand sponsored in 2015 to guarantee health care to 9/11 first responders and survivors. Instead of passing as its own bill, Republican lawmakers included Gillibrand’s legislation in an omnibus spending bill that became law that year. There have also been times when Gillibrand wrote legislation with a Republican, but was not the main sponsor. Even the White House gave her credit for a bill she worked on with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley last year. ""Later this afternoon, the President is going to be signing two bills that were both passed with bipartisan support that help protect those who protect us,"" then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at a press briefing in 2017. ""First, the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017, which was co-sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York."" Past PolitiFact ratings PolitiFact has rated similar statements anywhere from Mostly True to Mostly False depending on how the claim was phrased. The Republican Party of Florida recently claimed that out of 860 bills Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, had introduced in Congress, only 10 passed. That claim was rated Mostly False because more than 10 of Nelson’s bills and resolutions were passed in at least one chamber. Farley’s statement goes beyond that claim by saying none of Gillibrand’s bills have become law. Experts have also agreed in past rulings that measuring a lawmaker’s success by the number of sponsored bills that become law can be misleading. There are other actions a lawmaker can take to be effective. One example: Gillibrand convinced members of the Senate to hold hearings on allowing gay and lesbian people in the military during her first year in the chamber. The policy was changed two years later. Our ruling Farley said Gillibrand has not sponsored a bill that has become law during her time in Congress. Farley’s right that Gillibrand has not been the sole sponsor on a bill that became law. But some of her legislative proposals have been included in larger bills sponsored by other members. And Farley's count includes resolutions, 23 of which passed in the Senate. Farley paints Gillibrand as a lawmaker without any legislative victories. That’s not true. Her statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2018/may/04/chele-farley/gillibrands-opponent-claims-she-hasnt-passed-any-b/

Following Trump endorsement, Jim Renacci cites polls showing strong Trump support in Ohio
","Following an endorsement for Senate from President Donald Trump, U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci said Trump continues to have strong support in Ohio, particularly among Republicans. ""President Trump is still supported by almost 85 percent of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio and -- and that's from recent polling -- and still has a 58 percent approval rating in Ohio,"" Renacci said in a radio interview with Bob Frantz April 25. Renacci’s chief rival in the May 8 primary is businessman Mike Gibbons. The winner will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in November. How Ohio voters feel about Trump heading into the midterms is of national interest following Trump’s 8-percentage point win over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Former President Barack Obama had won the state twice. While polling has come under suspicion since the election, Renacci is citing valid polls. However, he used a national poll to draw conclusions about Ohio GOP voters, something pollsters say isn’t a great practice. Multiple polls show Trump continues to have strong GOP support, but he has much less support among voters in general. Renacci’s claim that Trump has 58 percent overall support is probably too high. For Renacci’s claim that Trump had 85 percent approval among Republicans in Ohio, his campaign spokesman referred to a national CNN-SSRS poll. A December poll of 1,000 adults showed that 85 percent of Republicans had a favorable opinion of Trump. The poll showed that when both major parties as well as independents are included, 36 percent had a favorable opinion of Trump. The margin of sampling error was 3.6 percent. A couple of polling experts we interviewed took issue with Renacci using a national poll to express support by Ohio Republicans, although they noted polls show Trump has strong support among Ohio Republicans. When Renacci referred to Trump’s 58 percent approval rating, that came from a poll specifically of Ohio registered voters. Renacci’s campaign spokesman cited an online poll of registered voters by Axios/SurveyMonkey done in February and March. The poll of 1,995 registered voters in Ohio showed overall, 54 percent of Ohio registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling his job as president. Among Republicans and independents who lean Republican, 93 percent approved. The survey’s modeled error estimate is 4.5 percent -- so that’s why Renacci cited 58 percent. We looked at two additional polls of Ohio Republicans this year -- Fallon Research on behalf of a GOP advocacy group, and SurveyUSA on behalf of a TV station -- that showed 75 percent approval for Trump. But polls consistently show far less approval when taking into account voters of both major parties and independents. Gallup’s daily tracking found in 2017 that overall in Ohio, Trump had 45 percent approval. SurveyUSA found 41 percent overall approval. A pro-Renacci group, the Ohio First PAC, found Trump’s approval among likely voters was 58 percent in April. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said it’s best to look at averages. ""I think the Renacci team is on solid ground suggesting an approval rating for Trump in the 80s for Republicans in Ohio, but I think 58 percent overall is probably unrealistically high,"" he said. Trump performed better in Ohio (51 percent) than he did nationally (46 percent), so it stands to reason that his approval in Ohio would be higher than it is nationally, Kondik said. ""If the national average is around 41 or 42 percent, I’d think that probably means Trump is in the mid-to-high 40s in Ohio,"" Kondik said. ""That’s about where I think it probably is."" University of Cincinnati associate professor of political science professor Steve Mockabee said that the 58 percent struck him as a little high. Jennifer Duffy, who covers Senate rates for the Cook Political Report, said Trump's support among Republicans in Ohio is pretty solid and that 85 percent is in the ballpark. ""It is not something that should concern Republicans,"" she said. The polling showing 58 percent among all registered voters is largely based on a turnout model and could be entirely correct for that model and not overstated, she said.   ""The larger question is whether that model bears any resemblance to actual 2018 turnout,"" she said. Ohio State University political science professor Vladimir Kogan said that whether someone identifies as a Republican can change over time, partly in response to Trump approval. He pointed to a 2017 working paper by the Emory University political scientists B. Pablo Montagnes, Zachary Peskowitz and Joshua McCrain, who argued that Republicans who disapprove of Trump stop identifying as Republicans. While Renacci made this claim in the context of a GOP primary, the bigger question is how the battleground state will vote in November. While Clinton was unpopular in Ohio, Brown has a long track record of winning statewide races. ""I’m not convinced yet that just following a Trump playbook is going to result in a win,"" Mockabee said. Renacci said, ""President Trump is still supported by almost 85 percent of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio -- and that's from recent polling -- and still has a 58 percent approval rating in Ohio."" While Renacci referred to 85 percent of Ohio Republicans, the CNN/SSRS poll his campaign cited from December 2017 was of national Republicans. However, Trump fared better in Ohio than the nation in 2016, so it’s not surprising that his support would be high in the state. A couple of other polls we found had Ohio GOP support slightly less at 75 percent. The part of his statement about the 58 percent approval overall refers to an Axios/SurveyMonkey poll. It showed 54 percent of Ohio registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling his job as president. By using the survey’s modeled error estimate of 4.5 percent Renacci gets to the 58 percent. A couple of polling experts said this sounds high. Overall support for Trump in Ohio is likely less than Renacci said.  We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/may/04/jim-renacci/following-trump-endorsement-jim-renacci-cites-poll/

Indiana's Mike Braun overplays opponents' records on Obama trade deals
","Lifelong political rivals Todd Rokita and Luke Messer have been locked in a bitter personal feud to represent Indiana in the U.S. Senate for over a year. But they had reason to band together in the last debate before voting day. Mike Braun, the third challenger who touts himself as a business-savvy outsider, called his rivals advocates of former President Barack Obama — in a race that has been all about who is most aligned with President Donald Trump. Braun built his career as a businessman and served three years in the state House of Representatives and 10 years on the Jasper School Board. Messer and Rokita have represented Indiana in Congress for three and four terms respectively. The three are competing in a May 8 primary for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. ""Let’s make it clear,"" Braun said. ""They voted to fast-track Obama’s trade deals. Now, they’re acting like it’s a tool for President Trump.  They can’t escape it, I know it’s tough. They try to twist it, but that’s the truth. That was Obama’s fast-tracking and look at the trade deals we got into."" Messer and Rokita shot back. ""Not one trade deal passed under Obama with the authority you cited,"" Messer said. ""Not one, Mike. And you know it."" ""Not one trade deal passed for President Obama,"" Rokita said. ""We made sure of that."" So who’s telling the truth? Both sides make fair points. In 2015, Messer and Rokita voted for the Defending Public Safety Employees’ Retirement Act. Tucked into that law was the Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA, in question. Presidents are the usual trade negotiators, but the Constitution only allows Congress to set tariffs. So Congress can speed up, or fast-track, votes on trade by allowing for a change in the rules. That is, Congress can’t amend or filibuster a trade agreement, and the deal only needs 51 votes in the Senate to pass. These have been granted in some form or another to most presidents since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In each specific law, Congress lays out the conditions for the deals the president will negotiate. ""If you are bringing back a trade agreement for an up or down vote, no amendments procedure, Congress tells the president, it has to do all these things we lay out,"" said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Alden said the conditions laid out in the 2015 TPA were designed for the negotiation of Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. That said, the rules would apply to any trade negotiation in that time period. If the Trump administration renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement, it will also be submitted under the 2015 trade authority Messer and Rokita voted for. The 2015 law included a provision that would automatically renew it on July 1, 2018, for the next three years, unless Congress votes to block it. Trump requested its renewal on March 20. ""These are modifications of the House and Senate rules (in this case the House) that apply regardless of who’s president,"" said Grant Aldonas, a senior advisor on international trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""So to the extent it’s characterized as voting to fast-track a particular president’s trade deal, that’s wrong."" But Messer and Rokita bring up good points: TPP never came to a vote because the Republican Congress blocked it. Congress never got to give the agreement a formal up or down vote, but opponents did effectively kill the deal. To be clear, three trade deals with Colombia, South Korea and Panama passed under Obama in October 2011. But those had been primarily negotiated under President George W. Bush, and were not subject to the 2015 law in question. Braun said Messer and Rokita ""voted to fast-track Obama’s trade deals."" Messer and Rokita indeed voted in favor of fast-track authority in 2015. The authority was for three years, counting toward both Obama and his successor’s trade deals. It has and will apply to Trump’s trade deals for another three years if Congress does not vote to block it come July. The law would have applied to the TPP if it had come up for a vote. But a vote in favor of the authority does not equate a vote in favor of the deal. Messer and Rokita could have still voted against ""Obama’s trade deals.""

Gov. Rick Scott attack mischaracterizes vote Sen. Bill Nelson took in 2015
","As Florida’s U.S. Senate race heats up, Republican Gov. Rick Scott slammed Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson’s record on Iran. ""While Bill Nelson voted against requiring Iran to recognize Israel and release American hostages, the following year, Governor Scott signed legislation that helped prevent state investments in Iran,"" Scott said in a press release April 30. For this fact-check, we wanted to hone in on Nelson’s specific votes. We found that Scott’s claim mischaracterizes the vote Nelson took and leaves out that Nelson has actually advocated for the release of hostages in Iran. Nelson and Scott will face each other Nov. 6. In 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a joint resolution known as the Hire More Heroes Act of 2015. This measure aimed to encourage small businesses to hire veterans. The bill itself had nothing to do with Israel, Iran or American hostages. But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., offered up several amendments related to the Iran nuclear agreement. Often times, a member of Congress will attach an unrelated, controversial amendment in hopes of prompting debate on the amendment’s issue, experts said.   And that’s what happened when McConnell proposed amendment 2656. Experts told us the amendment would have jeopardized the Iran deal by blocking the president from fulfilling the commitments the United States had agreed to unless Iran met other demands outside of the deal’s terms. Specifically, the amendment would have prohibited the president from waiving sanctions unless Iran released Jason Rezaian, Robert Levinson, Saeed Abedini, and Amir Hekmati, and formally recognized Israel as an independent state. Nelson, along with nearly every other Democrat, voted no on a cloture motion on McConnell’s amendment. The amendment ended up failing after the original amendment was tabled. Nelson’s vote was technically a vote on a procedure. But Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist, said the vote was essentially intended as a proxy for a vote on the amendment. More important than that, however, is the fact Scott’s claim mischaracterizes the substance of the vote. Scott said Nelson voted against releasing American hostages and Iran recognizing Israel as a sovereign state, but multiple experts said the amendment was really just an attempt to kill the Iran deal. ""The vote was on whether to attach new conditions to the Iran nuclear agreement, thereby preventing the agreement from going forward,"" Koger said. Matthew Bunn, a professor of practice at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that had the amendment succeeded as intended in blocking the deal, the American hostages would almost certainly have remained in custody. He also noted that Nelson has been among the most dogged senators in pursuing the release of the fourth hostage, Levinson. Nelson met with Levinson’s family and has repeatedly called on Washington to urge Iran to release him. In 2017, Nelson led lawmakers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who sent a letter to White House officials asking them to ""maintain pressure on Iran to see that (Levinson) is returned as soon as possible."" This year, Nelson cosponsored the Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act (S.2365) to impose sanctions against individuals involved in taking Americans hostage and violating the human rights of the Iranian citizens. Scott said that Nelson ""voted against requiring Iran to recognize Israel and release American hostages."" The attack is a misleading stretch. What really happened in 2015 was that Nelson voted no on a cloture motion. By voting no, Nelson voted to continued debate on an amendment that experts said would have defeated the Iran deal. The amendment would have prohibited the president from waiving sanctions unless Iran released detained Americans and formally recognized Israel. But the deal was focused on the nuclear issue, not an attempt to solve major issues with Iran. Also, Nelson has worked to urge the White House to continue pressing for the release of a U.S. hostage in Iran.

U.S. Senate hopeful Kevin Nicholson stretches definition of state resident
","Does a part-time residence in the Northwoods make a person a resident of Wisconsin? Kevin Nicholson thinks so. Nicholson, a Delafield businessman and U.S. Marine veteran, is battling state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield for the Republican nomination in the race to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in November 2018. The Nicholson campaign released a list of new Finance Committee Co-Chairs from throughout Wisconsin -- an effort to show wide-ranging support for his bid. Included in the release was a list of Nicholson for Senate committee members and their hometowns, including ""Dick and Liz Uihlein (Minocqua)."" Nicholson also tweeted the release on April 19, 2018, with this message ""I’m honored to have an incredible committee as the outsider candidate for #wisen."" Hold on a minute. Nicholson is touting himself as ""the outsider candidate"" by releasing a list of Wisconsin supporters. But aren’t Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein frequently referred to as Illinois residents? Residency Richard Uihlein is a well-known GOP mega-donor. An April 29, 2018, profile of Uihlein in The Washington Post said he has ""risen to become one of the most powerful — and disruptive — GOP donors in the country."" The article notes that Uihlein is a resident of Illinois, but has a substantial presence in Wisconsin politics: Richard Uihlein, a wealthy shipping-supplies magnate from Illinois who shuns the spotlight, has risen to become one of the most powerful — and disruptive — GOP donors in the country. Uihlein made his first major mark on the anti-union fight in Wisconsin in 2011, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend state senators in aggressive recall campaigns over their votes to end collective bargaining for public employees. That fight also marked the beginning of a friendship between Scott Walker and Uihlein, who was charmed by the Wisconsin governor over a dinner meeting at the Uihleins’ home. He became an instrumental supporter of the governor’s campaign against public unions. In an April 13, 2018, article, the Associated Press also noted the involvement of Uihlein in Wisconsin politics: The billionaire founder of shipping and packaging supply giant Uline Corp. continues to spend big on Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race in support of Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson. Richard Uihlein gave $500,000 last month to the newly formed Club for Growth Action Wisconsin super PAC, which supports Nicholson. Uihlein has given nearly $16 million since 2017 to eight groups that are supporting Nicholson in the Republican primary against state Sen. Leah Vukmir. Spending by the groups Uihlein supports has helped make the Senate race the most expensive in the country so far. So, Uihlein has a major footprint in Wisconsin politics. But that doesn’t make him a state resident. The evidence Numerous articles in a variety of publications, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, have referred to Uihlein as a Lake Forest, Ill., businessman who co-owns Uline Corp., based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis. The most solid piece of evidence is the Uihleins’ voter registration, which firmly identifies them as registered to vote in Illinois: Name: Richard E Uihlein Age: 72 Registration Status: Richard Uihlein IS REGISTERED TO VOTE in the State of Illinois.   Name: Elizabeth A Uihlein Age: 72 Registration Status: Elizabeth Uihlein IS REGISTERED TO VOTE in the State of Illinois. To qualify for voter registration in Illinois, you must: Be a U.S. citizen. Be a resident of Illinois for at least 30 days. Be at least 18 years old (if you are 17 years old, can vote in the General Primary election IF they will be 18 years old on or before the General Election)(tighten for our sake here). NOT be registered to vote in another state. A search of the My Vote Wisconsin database turns up zero hits on searches for Richard Uihlein or Elizabeth Uihlein. So, why does Nicholson say the Uihleins are from Wisconsin? Well, Uline CEO Richard Uihlein and Elizabeth Uihlein, president of Uline Corp., have substantial investments in the Town of Manitowish Waters through EAU Holdings, including a lodge, spa and coffee shop, among other matters. To be sure, Manitowish Waters and Minocqua are not interchangeable. They are 24 miles apart on U.S. 51 and Manitowish Waters is in Vilas County, while Minocqua is in Oneida County. A check of the Oneida County property records, where Minocqua is located, turns up zero hits in its database for either Uihlein or EAU Holdings. In Vilas County, the property database shows three parcel listings for Richard E. and Elizabeth A. Uihlein, as well as 13 parcel listings for EAU Real Estate LLC. A spokesman for the Uihleins declined to comment. Asked about the campaign’s basis to claim the couple are Wisconsin residents, Nicholson spokesman Brandon Moody said in a April 24, 2018, email: ""they have a residence in Minocqua. They spend a great deal of time there and they are massive job creators in Wisconsin."" Moody went on to refer to dual residencies. ""Many donors have multiple addresses. Some live in Florida half the year. That type of thing. This is pretty standard operating procedure,"" Moody said.   Our rating Nicholson released a list of Wisconsin supporters that included ""Dick and Liz Uihlein (Minocqua)."" The Uihleins are major business owners in Pleasant Prairie and own property in Manitowish Waters. But Richard E. Uihlein is frequently referred to in the media as an Illinois businessman and he is a registered voter of Illinois. So is his wife, Elizabeth A. Uihlein.

Fact-checking Don Blankenship on Mitch McConnell and China
","In the closing days of West Virginia’s Senate primary, relations between Republicans Don Blankenship and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have turned sour. Blankenship is running for Senate despite spending a year in jail for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found that, under his leadership as CEO of Massey Energy, the company systematically refused to take steps that would have prevented a deadly combination of methane gas and coal dust that left 29 West Virginia miners dead in 2010. The prospect that a candidate with that kind of background could win the nomination to face Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin has prompted national Republicans to target Blankenship in the hope that he doesn’t win the primary. Blankenship’s top rivals for the nomination are U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. In April, a group of GOP strategists aligned with McConnell established the Mountain Families PAC, backed by six-figure television ad buys targeting Blankenship, Politico reported. Blankenship responded by attacking McConnell, including an ad that dubbed him ""Cocaine Mitch."" (That reportedly refers to a 2014 article in The Nation that said drugs had been found on a ship owned by the family of Elaine Chao, McConnell’s wife and the current Transportation Secretary.) In a May 1 Fox News debate in Morgantown, W.Va., Blankenship continued to attack McConnell and Chao. He brought up the incidents of June 1989, when the Chinese government cracked down militarily on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, resulting in the deaths of between hundreds and perhaps thousands of protesters. ""Mitch McConnell was one of the few senators that voted after Tiananmen Square not to have punitive actions against China for human rights violations,"" Blankenship said. Let’s look at what Congress did in the aftermath. After the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the United States responded with a series of economic sanctions. On Jan. 30, 1990, the Senate followed the House in passing a $9.7 billion spending measure for State Department activities during fiscal years 1990 and 1991. That bill included a suspension of U.S. financial support to China by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development Program. It also stopped the licensing for U.S. exports of military items. The bill passed the Senate, 98-0, and McConnell voted for it. So the most straightforward way to interpret Blankenship’s statement doesn’t hold up. After we reached out to Blankenship’s campaign, they clarified the legislation in question. It was actually a bill from 2000 known as S. 2277. The bill would have authorized the president to extend ""normal"" trade relations to China, as long as the president certified that China was living up to World Trade Organization standards. This is something quite different than what Blankenship said during the debate. Here are some of the problems with Blankenship’s characterization of the bill in question? • The bill didn’t come just after Tiananmen. Blankenship said McConnell voted for the bill ""after Tiananmen Square."" But S. 2277 was hardly in the immediate aftermath of the killings -- it came 11 years later. • McConnell couldn’t have ""voted"" for it. Blankenship said McConnell ""voted"" on the bill, but S. 2277 was an early version of a bill that was later subsumed into a different piece of legislation. So S. 2277 never actually received a floor vote. The Blankenship campaign acknowledged to PolitiFact that it would have been more accurate to say the bill was ""sponsored"" by McConnell. • McConnell wasn’t one of a ""few"" GOP supporters. McConnell was indeed a sponsor of S. 2277, along with 10 other Republicans and 14 Democrats. That amounted to one-fifth of the Republican conference at the time -- a significant number of co-sponsors for a Senate bill, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in the U.S. Senate. Moreover, the bill passed out of the Senate Finance Committee with only one dissenting vote in either party. (McConnell was not on the Finance Committee, so he could not have voted on it there.) Once S. 2277 was incorporated into the successor bill -- H.R. 4444 -- that bill received broad support, as well. The bill passed the Senate by an 83-15 margin, with 46 Republicans voting for it and eight opposing it. That’s a Republican conference support rate of 85 percent. • The final version of the bill is more nuanced on human rights than Blankenship suggests. Blankenship has a point that the final bill was designed to end the requirement that the United States renew China’s ""normal"" trade status on an annual basis. But the bill did seek to maintain some leverage over Chinese human rights policy. Specifically, it established a Congressional-Executive Commission on the People’s Republic of China, charged with monitoring ""the acts of the People’s Republic of China which reflect compliance with or violation of human rights."" The bill offered a detailed list of human-rights concerned, ranging from freedom of expression and religion to an end to arbitrary arrest and cruel and unusual punishment. The bill also said U.S. funds could be spent for certain purposes in China ""if the president has credible evidence"" that the recipient ""has been materially responsible for the commission of human rights violations."" We should also mention Blankenship’s apparent implication that Chao is a reason why McConnell is soft on China. ""The key question is what we would expect of McConnell and Chao if they had no Chinese ties,"" Koger said. ""Answer: There is no clear difference. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were a lot of voices calling to end the annual certification of China's trade status. Congress passed a law to that effect, and not because most members of Congress have rich Chinese in-laws."" Blankenship said, ""Mitch McConnell was one of the few senators that voted after Tiananmen Square not to have punitive actions against China for human rights violations."" This assertion is inaccurate in multiple ways. McConnell and every other Senate Republican had voted in favor of sanctions in the immediate aftermath of Tiananmen Square; the legislation Blankenship said he was referring to came 11 years later. The 2000 bill arguably weakened but did not eliminate human-rights leverage over China. And the vast majority of Republicans -- not just a ""few"" -- supported the final version of the measure. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2018/may/03/don-blankenship/fact-checking-don-blankenship-mitch-mcconnell-chin/

Beto O’Rourke: ‘Zero’ terrorists or plots against Americans connected to U.S.-Mexico border
","At a North Texas campaign stop, Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful Beto O’Rourke declared there have been ""precisely zero"" terrorists, terror groups or plots against Americans also connected to the U.S.-Mexico border. None ever? That seemed like a big gulp. We heard the El Paso congressman's comment by watching his campaign’s Facebook Live video of his 35-minute Jan. 3, 2018, ""town hall"" in Greenville, the county seat of Hunt County. O’Rourke took aim at President Donald Trump’s desire for a border wall, saying: ""At this time of vicious rhetoric, paranoia and fear and hatred and bigotry aimed at the rest of the world, can you get this: a 2,000-mile, $25 billion, 30-foot-high, pure concrete wall at a time of record U.S.-Mexico border security, at a time that zero, precisely zero, terrorists, terrorist groups or terror plots have ever been connected with the U.S.-Mexico border to do harm to people within the United States?"" O'Rourke cites testimony O’Rourke made a similar statement on Facebook in 2015, writing: ""As a member of the House Homeland Security committee in the 113th Congress, I asked the director of the FBI, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Secretary of Homeland Security if there was currently any terrorist threat on the Southern border. They answered that there was not, nor had there ever been, any terrorist, terrorist plot, or terrorist organization that was able to exploit our border with Mexico."" When we asked O’Rourke’s campaign to provide his basis for declaring no connections ever between terrorists or terror plots and the U.S.-Mexico border, campaign spokesman Chris Evans emailed us a document centered on whether terrorists made moves along the border into late 2014. The document, titled ""Border ISIL Fact Sheet #1,"" references 2014 video clips of and numerous news reports about Department of Homeland Security officials rebutting claims that ISIS had plans to enter the U.S. through Mexico. Some of the reports note that conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican who seeks re-election against O’Rourke this November, raised concerns that members of ISIS could enter or might have already entered the U.S. Federal officials pushed back. According to a New York Daily News account cited in O’Rourke’s document, Jennifer Lasley, a Homeland Security official, told House members at a Sept. 10, 2014, hearing: ""We don't have any credible information that we are aware of, of known or suspected terrorists coming across the border."" A Texas document O’Rourke’s information was more than three years old when he made his claim in Greenville. So as part of gauging his claim, we searched the Nexis database for news accounts posted since 2011 of terrorist plots connected to the border, finding none. We also took note of nine past PolitiFact fact-checks of border terrorist claims that did not prove accurate. In February 2018, for instance, we found Pants on Fire a claim that ""along the southern border of the U.S.,"" the government apprehends ""seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists."" No facts backed up that border-specific claim. Nationally in 2017, Homeland Security reported stopping 2,554 individuals on its terrorist watch list from entering the country, most of whom tried to enter by air. Earlier, though, PolitiFact Florida in 2016 found Mostly True a claim that according to reports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had ""apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years."" There had been one such report, by a Texas agency. Yet in its 2015 document assessing state-level border security efforts, the Texas Department of Public Safety also acknowledged no plots uncovered. The document, obtained at the time by the Houston Chronicle, notes that Mexican drug cartels draw on transnational gangs to commit crimes in Texas. It goes on: ""Illegal aliens from countries documented by the U.S. Department of State as having a known terrorism presence continue to be smuggled into and throughout Texas and the nation on a regular basis, and it is impossible to determine how many of these individuals have actually entered the U.S. undetected."" ""Texas,"" the document says, ""leads the nation in the apprehension of ‘special interest aliens’ (SIA), and there is a legitimate concern that terrorists from around the world could exploit our country’s porous Southwest border to enter the U.S. undetected, if they have not done so already."" Such individuals, the document says, are ""citizens of 35 countries that could represent a terrorist threat,"" most of which are in the Middle East and North Africa. Smuggling Somali nationals The report also singles out law enforcement encounters with Somali nationals described as having connections to terrorist groups. Of the Somali travelers, the document says, one was a member of terror group al-Shabaab and claimed to have defected and another was previously denied a visa and on ""multiple U.S. terrorism watch lists."" A third, Ahmed Muhammed Dhakane – the only one identified in the document – was an active member of the terror group, the document says, and a ""guerilla fighter and human smuggler who knowingly helped move into the U.S. several potentially dangerous Somali terrorists who he believed would commit violent acts if ordered to do so."" The document also mentions an American citizen who, ""for a period of several years until January 2010,"" smuggled 272 Somalis into the country through Cuba and Mexico. ""Investigators stated that he acknowledged that leaders of al-Shabaab solicited his services but that he declined,"" the report states. ""However, investigators found an email exchange in which he acknowledged, ‘I helped a lot of Somalis and most are good but there are some who are bad and I leave them to Allah.’"" Newspaper specifies terrorist ties More detail came to our attention in a Jan. 15, 2017 Christian Science Monitor news story that also pinpointed other cases tracing terrorist plots or organizations to the Mexico-U.S. border. The story, citing court documents, identifies the smuggler of Somalis as Anthony Joseph Tracy. Under the scheme, the story said, Tracy's clients flew from Kenya to Dubai to Moscow to Cuba. From there, the story says, they would fly to Belize and then travel to Mexico to make their way across the U.S. border. Tracy, the story says, pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiring to induce non-citizens to enter the country without legal authorization. The Monitor story also lists the cases of Mahmoud Kourani, Adnan El Shukrijumah and Abdullahi Omar Fidse. According to the story, Kourani was a Hezbollah fundraiser smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico in 2001. He was later sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to ""conspiring to support a terrorist organization,"" according to a June 15, 2005 Associated Press news account. Shukrijumah, who landed on the FBI’s most-wanted list after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, was said to have hidden in northern Mexico—among varied places—and then plotted a foiled 2009 New York City subway suicide bombing attack. It’s unclear whether that plot involved the U.S.-Mexico border; the Monitor story says Shukrijumah was killed near the Pakistan-Afghan border in 2014. The story states that Fidse entered the U.S. from Mexico at the Hidalgo, Texas port of entry in 2008 and told officials he was a Somalian refugee. Officials later learned that he lied about his background, the story says, and Fidse confided to an FBI informant that he supported Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda and Al Shabab. ""Fidse was denied asylum,"" the story says. ""Instead he was prosecuted and sentenced to eight years in prison for lying to federal agents."" The 2015 DPS document, despite detailing some such activities, notes a lack of evidence of terrorist plots or activities associated with the border, stating: ""We judge that foreign terrorists almost certainly are aware of the U.S.-Mexico border’s vulnerability to illegal entry, though we currently are not aware of any specific and credible information indicating a terrorist plot associated with the border."" State Department: No ‘credible information’ Web searches led us to a recent federal analysis with a similar nothing-known bottom line. The State Department’s 2016 Country Reports on Terrorism, published in July 2017, states that the agency’s work with Mexico has maintained border security. ""Counterterrorism cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments remained strong,"" the department summed up, going on: ""There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States."" To our inquiry in April 2018, Nicole Thompson, a State Department spokeswoman, said by email that the judgment that no terrorist had traveled through Mexico to gain U.S. access still held. We were unsuccessful eliciting judgments on terrorist threats tied to the border from the Department of Homeland Security as well as border and homeland security officials for the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Cato Institute: No terrorist plots We also reviewed a non-government analysis, reaffirmed in 2018, that found no terrorist plots involving adults crossing the U.S.-Mexico border--but one ultimately foiled plot involving ethnic Albanians who'd entered the country as youngsters accompanying their parents. In 2016, Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research organization, wrote a ""risk analysis of the visa categories"" used by foreign-born terrorists who had carried out attacks in the U.S. between 1975 and 2015. Over the 40 years, Nowrasteh concluded, nine terrorists carried out or had plans to carry out U.S. attacks after entering the country illegally. ""Those nine terrorists killed zero people in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil from 1975 through 2017,"" Nowrasteh said in a Jan. 19, 2018, article on the institute’s website. ""Of those nine terrorists who entered illegally,"" Nowrasteh elaborated, ""only three did so along the border with Mexico: Shain Duka, Britan Duka, and Eljvir Duka crossed as children with their parents in 1984. They are ethnic Albanians from Macedonia. They were three conspirators in the incompetently planned Fort Dix plot that the FBI foiled in 2007, long after they became adults and more than two decades after they entered illegally."" That plot, the New York Times reported in 2007, was stopped thanks in part to government infiltrators. The newspaper said the plotters were part of a group of extremists who ""represent the newest breed of threat: loosely organized domestic militants unconnected to — but inspired by — Al Qaeda or other international terror groups."" That Fort Dix plan, Nowrasteh commented by phone, wasn’t one 23 years in the making. ""It was just…you’re going to have an immigrant terrorist, he had to have entered at some time, and these kids happened to enter when they were children,"" Nowrasteh said, ""and then grew up to become really bad terrorists who didn’t kill anybody and got caught."" Nowrasteh said he gathered the identities of terrorists from nine data sets and documents and used ""news stories, court documents, government reports and publicly accessible databases"" to round out his research. Also by phone, Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, said he didn’t know of terror plots with ties to the southern border but sees ""serious vulnerability"" in that terrorists could collaborate with drug cartels. Then again, Tree said, that’s not likely at moment because ""no head of a cartel wants to engage with terrorists because if they’re ever caught, then the entire weight of the U.S. federal government falls on their head and not on their rivals."" A 2011 assassination plot To our inquiries, experts including Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a right-leaning foreign policy think tank, referenced a 2011 plot to assassinate Adel al-Jubeir, then the Saudi ambassador to the United States. Iranian-born Manssor Arbabsiar, a Texas car salesman, who ventured south from Texas into a Mexico border city to enlist a Mexican drug cartel willing to carry out the hit. Arbabsiar had plans beyond that, including wanting to attack the Israeli embassy to the U.S. in Washington, D.C., and Israeli and Saudi embassies in Argentina, according to a January 2015 Chronicle news story. Arbabsiar thought his plan was underway, the story says, but the federal government was building a case against him. Arbabsiar, ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison, later would cooperate with federal officials and say he acted alone, according to the Chronicle. Gartenstein-Ross told us: ""Fortunately the person who was trying to orchestrate it ended up talking to a"" Drug Enforcement Administration ""agent who was standing in, posing as a cartel member, but that was clearly a plot, which was directed up through the southern border"" to kill Jubeir, who later became the Saudi minister of foreign affairs. Gartenstein-Ross said by phone that Iran is said to have been behind the plot to assassinate the ambassador, but that’s also in dispute--though whether there was a plot isn’t disputed. Gartenstein-Ross made the same point as Tree did about potential border-linked threats. ""It’s much more of a potential danger rather than a danger that has materialized, but when you have a potential danger that has not materialized, things could change fairly quickly,"" he said. By email, Nowrasteh suggested to us that the assassination ""plot"" proved to be no more than an individual getting duped by an informant--a point also made to us by phone by O'Rourke's spokesman, Evans. Nowrasteh wrote: ""This case doesn’t show that terrorists crossed the Mexican border or that this was a real threat. The Mexican ‘source’ during the investigation was a DEA informant the entire time, and the convicted terrorist had no contact with any real cartel member."" Jessica Vaughan, an analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, which says it has a ""pro-immigrant, low-immigration vision,"" countered, when we inquired, that it shouldn’t matter if federal law enforcement unplugged Arbabsiar’s plan. It was still a terrorist plot, she said by phone. To our inquiry, Fred Burton, a former State Department official serving as chief security officer for Stratfor, an Austin-based geopolitical intelligence company, also pointed out Arbabsiar’s stymied plans. Burton said he’d describe the intended assassination as a ""transnational terror plot that originated in Mexico that affected the target in the United States."" Burton said he was unaware of other terror plots connected to the border. Next, we circled back to O'Rourke's campaign with what we'd learned. In reply, Evans reminded us that O'Rourke was told directly by Homeland Security at a 2014 hearing that there'd been no terrorists or terror plots against Americans tied to the border. ""There's been no indication that that information has changed,"" Evans said by phone. Our ruling O’Rourke said that ""precisely zero terrorists, terrorist groups or terror plots have ever been connected with the U.S.-Mexico border to do harm to people within the United States."" State Department declarations support this claim while experts told us such instances have proved extremely rare. However, zero means nothing--and it’s not so that there have been absolutely no cases of terrorists or terrorist plots tied to the border. It also looks to us like authorities have foiled every known plan. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Lupe Valdez: 'I come from the poorest ZIP code in San Antonio'
","Lupe Valdez, who ran ahead of fellow Democratic candidates for governor in the party’s March 2018 primary, later told a commentator she’s better qualified than the other Democrat still in the race because of challenges she’s overcome. Valdez replied to an April 2018 question about why she’s the better pick heading in the May 22, 2018, primary runoff with Houston investor Andrew White: ""First of all, I come from the poorest ZIP code in San Antonio and I had to struggle to get to where I am. I had to struggle to go to school. I had to struggle to go to college. I had to struggle in the military. I was always a person struggling to get further along. I know what it is to have to struggle in your everyday life. And the majority of Texans are still struggling today."" Valdez has long lived in Dallas County, where she served as the county sheriff into 2018. Still, we were curious about the relative poverty of where she grew up on San Antonio’s Westside. Campaign cites editorial When we sought more information, Kiefer Odell of Valdez’s campaign replied by email that Valdez grew up on Calles Street, which runs just a few blocks, ""in the 78207 zip code in San Antonio and lived there until she went to college."" Odell pointed out a March 2016 San Antonio Express-News editorial describing the 78207 ZIP code, which had been featured nearly 50 years earlier in a CBS News documentary, ""Hunger in America,"" In 78207, the editorial said, ""nearly half of the adults don’t have a high school diploma. Nearly 60 percent of adults are not working. Unemployment is up. Income is far below the state’s median level. The poverty rate is stuck at 42 percent."" The editorial said: ""Generations have passed, and it’s hard to say that life in the 78207 ZIP code is demonstrably better than when ‘Hunger in America’ was released."" Odell pointed too to a September 2017 account from the Rivard Report, a San Antonio news website, citing a new study finding 78207 among the city’s most distressed areas. The analysis by the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank and advocacy group whose mission is to ""advance solutions that empower entrepreneurs and investors to forge a more dynamic American economy,"" includes a clickable U.S. map that enabled us to isolate San Antonio’s ZIP codes by levels of distress. According to the research, rooted in American Community Survey data for 2011-15, the inner-city 78207 ZIP code ranks among nine San Antonio ZIP codes with distress scores of 90 percent or more. Within 78207, the research suggests, 47 percent of adults lacked a high school diploma; 46 percent weren’t working; and 41 percent of residents lived in poverty. Parsing federal estimates From the start, we confronted a hitch in fact-checking Valdez’s claim; the U.S. Postal Service put ZIP codes in place everywhere in July 1963. At the time, Valdez, born in 1947, was in her teens. Still, we were able to get information tied to ZIP codes for recent years and nearly 20 years past plus data reflecting on poverty rates by neighborhood tracing as far back as 1960. With help from Jeff Bloem of the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota, a resource suggested by Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, we downloaded information collected in 1989 for the 1990 Census. Our sort of those results showed that at the time, 51 percent of residents of the 78207 ZIP code lived in poverty and the ZIP code ranked first among local ZIP codes in its raw count of residents in poverty (28,155). On the flip side, three less populous San Antonio ZIP codes had bigger shares of residents in poverty -- 78203 and 78208 (57 percent each, with 4,234 and 2,901 residents in poverty, respectively) and 78215 (53 percent, 657 people in poverty). For close-to-current data, we queried the bureau’s American FactFinder to fetch estimated poverty rates by ZIP code according to the American Community Survey covering 2012-16. Results: In those years, the 78207 ZIP code ranked second in San Antonio with 41 percent of residents (20,122 people) living in poverty--trailing the less populous 78202 ZIP code, which had 45 percent of residents (5,426 people) living in poverty. According to our sort, San Antonio ZIP codes with the next-highest poverty rates were 78203 (37 percent, 2,343 people); 78208 (35 percent, 1,527 people); and 78225 (33 percent, 4,576 people). By email, Potter cautioned against reaching conclusions based solely on the differing percentages. Once you consider ACS margins of error, Potter advised, the 78207, 78202, 78203 and 78208 ZIP codes had poverty rates not statistically distinct from each other. 78207 ""is one of four ZIP codes with the highest percent living in poverty"" in San Antonio, Potter summed up, and ""we couldn’t say anyone was more poor than the other with statistical certainty."" Potter also pointed us to Heywood Sanders, a University of Texas at San Antonio professor. When we inquired, Sanders had handy older breakdowns of poverty by neighborhood. By email, Sanders provided a 1974 bureau report, based on surveys taken in 1969, indicating that Westside neighborhoods including Calles Street accounted for the city’s greatest concentration of low-income residents. In 1969, the report states, 51,215 of the area’s 117,800 almost entirely ""Spanish language"" residents, 43.5 percent, lived in poverty; the report states that 36.2 percent of residents of the next-worst-off San Antonio neighborhood lived below poverty. Sanders also checked his records for poverty levels gauged for the 1960 census. According to that census, Sanders told us, the census tract taking in Calles Street ranked about sixth in the city for its share of residents in poverty with worse-off neighborhoods mostly on the Westside, which was once known as the Mexican Quarter or, more colloquially, Little Mexico, Sanders said. Why so long? We also inquired into the roots of 78207’s persistent high poverty. Potter, saying that he works in the ZIP code, said it’s ""commonly known to be one of, if not, the poorest areas of the city. Many people familiar with the city would be likely to say that even without looking at the data."" Another authority, Christine Drennon, director of the urban studies program at San Antonio’s Trinity University, identified a few factors. By email, Drennon said that when housing in the area was ""originally built in the early part of the 20th century, most of it was NOT deed restricted, yet (it) was situated amongst deed-restricted neighborhoods. In addition, the lots were smaller and the infrastructure nearly nonexistent. ""That resulted,"" Drennon wrote, ""in a non-Anglo population living in very humble housing which was later redlined and thus denied capital for rehab or upgrades. Due to local and federal policies like these, wealth was racialized, such that today this area is both poor and non-white. The housing was never replaced, thus it continues to house some of our poorest families,"" Drennon said. Patti Radle, a member of the San Antonio Independent School District board of trustees, said by phone that she’s lived in the 78207 ZIP code since 1969. Poverty abides, she said, ""but it’s a wonderful place to live because of the character of attention to family."" Affordable housing remains a need, Radle said, and smaller streets lack sidewalks though thanks to citizen activism, many streets are far better than before. Our ruling Valdez said: ""I come from the poorest ZIP code in San Antonio."" Poverty rates by ZIP code aren’t available for much of Valdez’s growing-up years though figures based on surveys taken in 1959, 1969, 1989 and from 2012 through 2016 show Valdez hails from the part of San Antonio long home to the greatest number of people in poverty. That said, a few other less populous ZIP codes occasionally had greater shares of residents in poverty. We rate her claim Mostly True.

Headline says Czech Republic armed citizens to shoot terrorists, but that's False
","An article sounding alarm bells about ""Islamic Extremism"" and migrants said that a new law designed to combat terrorism in the Czech Republic allows citizens to carry guns. ""Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight,"" said an April 27 headline on patriotnetwork.one, a website that posts multiple anti-Muslim articles. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story celebrated what it described as a new gun policy in the Czech Republic. ""Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation,"" patriotnetwork.one wrote. While the story said that this is ""breaking"" news, it actually refers to news developments several months ago. In fact, the same story appeared on multiple websites and Facebook in June 2017. While patriotnetwork.one portrayed the law as a done deal, it was only approved by one chamber of the government and so has not actually become law. In 2015, Czech president Milos Zeman called for an international military effort against terrorism and the Islamic State group. Speaking at a Holocaust commemoration forum in Prague, Zeman said such military action would prevent what he called a ""super Holocaust,"" in which hundreds of millions would die. Zeman said in 2016 interview that Czechs should obtain guns to protect themselves against terrorists. ''If it is necessary, people will have to be ready for a situation where they will have to use those guns,'' he said. ''My wife has just got a gun license and has a proper revolver. So I hope she will protect me from terrorists.'' In June 2017, the lower chamber passed an amendment to the constitution related to the carrying of firearms. Kieran Williams, an expert in the politics of Central and Eastern Europe at Drake University, told PolitiFact that the measure would have amended a 1998 act in order to create a constitutional right to keep and bear arms to assist the state against threats to national security. The original act made it a duty to help if called upon by the state. ""Czechs have long had statutory rights to keep and bear arms, and to use force in self-defense,"" he said. ""This constitutional bill was a response to a European Union directive to tighten up possession of certain categories of weapons after the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels and elsewhere; gun advocates hoped to minimize the impact of that directive on the Czech Republic by creating this new constitutional right."" The amendment passed the lower chamber in June. But it was rejected by the Senate in December when it fell short of the needed three-fifths majority. (Our Czech fact-checking friends at demagog.cz pointed us to the Senate vote.) Patriotnetwork.one makes no direct mention of the Senate, although it drew some information from a 2017 Sputniknews article that did mention that the bill still had to be approved by the Senate. The Patriotnetwork.one story is about the Czech Republic, but one of the photos the website used of an angry man appears to be the same as a 2015 photo of a man in a Budapest railway station. The patriotnetwork.one website tries to stir up fear about Muslims, migrants and terrorism in the Czech Republic while ignoring some facts. For starters, the Muslim population in the country of more than 10 million is tiny. The Muslim population was less than 4,000 in the 2011 census, but participants weren’t required to fill out information about their religion. That could be an undercount, but even other estimates aren’t much higher at 22,000. The Czech Republic has taken very few migrants in recent years and ""has no recent history of terrorism and generally has a declining rate of violent crime,"" WIlliams said. Sean Hanley, a senior lecturer at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London, said most migrants entering the Czech Republic wanted to access the country to get to other countries such as Germany. There were only 1,525 requests for asylum in the Czech Republic in 2015 and at the peak of the 2014-15 crisis around 1,500 migrants were detained by the Czech authorities for entering the country illegally.  Very small numbers of migrants and refugees entered compared with Hungary or Croatia. ""This is an entirely unrealistic ‘threat’ but it taps into and gives a focus to the fears and insecurities of small, mono-ethnic post-communist country in an uncertain world,"" he said. Hanley said it ""was one of the more bizarre legislative initiatives in the political history of the Czech Republic"" and occurred amid a backdrop of anti-refugee hysteria. Patriotnetwork.one said in a headline ""Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight."" First, this isn’t breaking news -- it refers to a proposed amendment in 2017 to create a constitutional right to keep and bear arms to assist the state against threats to national security. While the amendment passed the lower chamber in June 2017, it failed in the Senate in December 2017.

So says Thomas Jefferson? You might reconsider
","Even political junkies could be forgiven for not paying much attention to election in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. Pundits expect the heavily Republican swath of exurbs and rural land in the northeast corner of Georgia to pick GOP nominee Jody Hice over Democrat attorney Ken Dious come November. A former minister and radio talk show host, Hice has generated plenty of attention from his conservative takes on topics as disparate as religion (Islam not a religion but a ""geopolitical structure and, as such, does not deserve First Amendment protection"") and  qualifications to run for political office (""If the woman’s within the authority of her husband, I don’t see a problem.""). But certainly no one could roll their eyes to Hice’s decision to showcase what he calls his Constitutional conservatism via quotes from political idol Thomas Jefferson on Hice’s Facebook and Twitter pages. ""That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves,"" reads the quote attributed to Jefferson, over the image of a waving American flag. A reader asked PolitiFact Georgia to check out the quote. So we did.  To quote the Internet, 'Merica! To quote Anna Berkes, the research librarian at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello in Virginia, ""That sounds like something that he might have said or written, but in fact, he did not."" It turns out that our third president, the lead author of the Declaration of Independence who left this earthly plane 188 years ago, remains a prolific ""author"" on the Internet. He, too, has tackled topics as disparate as religion (""The Bible is the source of liberty,"" a bogus quote) and the qualifications to run for political office (""No man will ever bring out of that office the reputation which carries him into it,"" a verified quote). The misattributions floating around the web got so bad that a few years ago, Berkes set up the Spurious Quotations page on the Monticello website. The fake posted by Hice is a common mistake that was first incorrectly attributed to Jefferson in 1853. Historians long attributed the quote to Henry David Thoreau, who used a variation of it in his 1849 essay, ""Civil Disobedience,"" to argue that individuals should not let governments to make them agents of injustice. New research indicates, though, that Thoreau himself was likely quoting the magazine, The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, where the sentiment first appeared in 1837, Berkes said. ""The opinion has been associated with Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican party ideology, which is probably why people think he said it,"" Berkes said. ""The association is what has been called a natural Jeffersonian maxim. It’s just not a Jefferson quote."" Hice did not respond to requests for comment. He may, as Berkes’ suggests, find the dubious quotes still prove useful to convey a long-held ideology, regardless of the source. Or, as librarian and Jefferson researcher Eyler Robert Coates concludes, the attribution may belie a misunderstanding of Jefferson’s views. Coates argues the quote does not represent Jefferson because of its vague, abstract use of ""best"" and ""least."" One thing that is clear, is that there is no verifiable evidence that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote the sentiment. Correcting the record would surely square with Jefferson, who once said, ""If we are to guard against ignorance and remain free, it is the responsibility of every American to be informed."" OK, he didn’t say that, either. Thanks to Berkes’ carefully footnoted research, we can rate both our claim and that from Hice as False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/03/jody-hice/so-says-thomas-jefferson-you-might-reconsider/

Conservative group says Jeanne Shaheen's wealth has 'surged' since '08 election
","Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., insists an ad running against her is so blatantly false that her campaign asked a station to take it down. Meanwhile, the makers of the ad, the conservative group Ending Spending Action Fund, told us the ad is ""100 percent accurate."" Sounds like a job for PolitiFact. The ad, a 60-second spot, claims that New Hampshire families are struggling, but ""Shaheen’s wealth has surged while in public office."" The ad goes on to say that ""news reports raise questions about Shaheen’s family profiting from her votes in Congress, a shady stock deal and a conflict of interest."" The ad concludes: ""The Shaheen family gets richer. New Hampshire families get the bill."" Shaheen’s Republican opponent will be determined in a primary on Sept. 9 and the odds on favorite is former Sen. Scott Brown. Has Shaheen’s wealth surged in office? Shaheen’s worth Brian Baker, president of Ending Spending, emailed us the backup for the ad. He also told us that the despite Shaheen's protests, the ad continues to run in New Hamsphire, though it was tweaked to add a citation at the request of one television station. The evidence for this claim comes from OpenSecrets.org, a website run by the campaign finance watchdog group Center for Responsive Politics. OpenSecrets.org estimates a candidate’s net worth using financial disclosure reports. But it’s not an exact science. The forms don’t require candidates to list their actual holdings, but rather check a range of values for every job, bank account, investment or asset they hold, as well as their debts. For example, Shaheen marked down in 2008 that she has between $15,001 and $50,000 in a Ocean National Bank checking account. According to OpenSecrets.org, in 2008 when Shaheen was elected to the U.S. Senate, her net worth was $3.4 million. This is calculated by finding the mean of her total assets, which ranged from $2.94 million and $6.08 million, and subtracting the mean of her total liabilities, ranging from $650,000 to $1.5 million. Many of her assets are listed as shared with her husband, Bill Shaheen, with whom she files taxes jointly. Using the same methodology, OpenSecrets.org estimated Shaheen’s networth in 2012 was $5.4 million. Ending Spending compared the 2008 numbers with 2012 and came up with a $2 million increase. This is already problematic. Shaheen filed her disclosure forms for 2013 in May. So Ending Spending is not using the most up-to-date figures. Those figures show Shaheen’s net worth is $2.7 million, or $700,000 less than what it was in 2008. How did we get that? Shaheen’s 2013 form indicates that both the low and high end of her total assets are up from 2008, ranging from $3.75 million to $7.89 million. But her liabilities were up, too: between $2.03 million and $4.2 million. A lot of the added liabilities are for mortgages. In 2008, Shaheen had four mortgages and a promissory note. By 2013, she had 10 mortgages and two promissory notes. It’s important to stress that we don’t know where her assets fall in the range. The 2013 values overlap quite a bit with the figures reported in 2008. In that respect, it’s possible her assets haven’t gone up at all. But it’s fair to say that since 2008, the Shaheens have acquired stakes in several commercial and residential real estate properties, and the number of investments and financial ventures listed have increased. When the average voter’s net worth falls, it’s typically not because they are taking out multiple loans and purchasing more real estate property while their investments expand. Baker said only Shaheen's assets should be taken into consideration, not her debts. However, traditionally, wealth is measured by looking at both assets and liabilities to calculate net worth. There’s another way we can look at Shaheen’s finances. In June, her campaign allowed members of the media to view eight years of tax returns. They paint a mixed picture, according to news reports, and show Shaheen's income since taking office is flat and tied to her Senate salary, while her husband's ventures have gone up and down. The Telegraph in Nashua, N.H., reported that the couples’ highest income year came in 2012 — when Shaheen earned $580,000 between her Senate salary and her husband’s law firm. But Bill Shaheen’s business partnerships have also lost nearly $1 million over the past five years, the Telegraph found. For example, in 2010, the Shaheens reported $522,000 in income, but also $300,000 in losses resulting in a gross adjusted income of $186,000, according to the Concord Monitor. In 2013, the couple made about $505,000, the Monitor reported, which is close to their average annual pre-tax salary of $474,000 during the eight years released. Profiting from votes? The ad also insinuates that Shaheen’s wealth is somehow tied to her congressional action. All of the evidence from Ending Spending comes back to a June Boston Globe article largely focused on stock options her husband owned in Ultrawave Labs — stock options the campaign says were never exercised. The Globe reported that Shaheen’s husband had stock options in the company in 2009 valued between $1,000 and $15,000. Around the same time, Ultrawave Labs — a company ""developing new imaging technology to detect breast cancer,"" according to the article — received about $78,000 in stimulus money. Shaheen voted for the stimulus — along with every other Democrat (except a sick Sen. Ted Kennedy). The money for Ultrawave came through the National Science Foundation, and was not specifically earmarked by Shaheen, as FactCheck.org noted in their own analysis of the ad. The ad says Shaheen ""failed to properly report"" the stock. What it doesn’t tell you is the stock options were ""misreported"" only because Shaheen failed to show it had already expired, her campaign said. According to the forms, in 2013 the stocks were valued between $0 and $1,000. The Globe also notes that Ultrawave Labs has lobbied Congress and the Defense Department to allocate more money for breast cancer research. During her time in Congress, Shaheen has pushed legislation to do the same, at one point supporting a program that would fund breast cancer research through the military (Shaheen sits on the Armed Services Committee). The law firm Shaheen’s husband works at, Shaheen & Gordon, also sought to help clients get stimulus money by creating a ""stimulus opportunities team,"" according to the Globe. The firm told the Globe it had no clients and was ""short-lived."" The Globe quoted a good-government group that’s critical of the Shaheens business practices, and it’s certainly worthwhile for voters to consider these findings at the ballot box. However, the points raised in the story don’t seem to prove the central premise of the ad that Shaheen’s wealth has surged as a result of her congressional action. Our ruling The Ending Spending Action Fund ad claims ""Shaheen’s wealth has surged while in public office."" By one measure, Shaheen’s net worth has actually gone down since she took office. Though she and her husband have listed more assets, investments and financial ventures than in 2008, they also have considerably more debt from more mortgages. Her tax returns, filed jointly with her husband, have shown wide fluctuations in income since 2006, making it hard to discern whether her wealth ""surged."" Her 2013 income was just slightly higher than her average earnings during the past eight years. Ending Spending pointed to a story that has raised questions about the business practices of Shaheen’s husband and their relation to her votes in Congress. However, the findings of the story don’t indicate a surge in wealth by the family. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Bloggers incorrectly blast ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, saying 73% goes to overhead, fundraising
","By now, there are very few Americans who haven’t heard of the ""ALS Ice Bucket Challenge"" -- the social media-driven campaign during the summer of 2014 to dump ice water on your head as a way of raising awareness of the neuromuscular disease ALS and promoting donations to the ALS Association, which funds medical research and support programs for those who have the disease. The effort has led to at least $94 million in donations to the ALS Association -- a jolt of extra funding for a group that last year spent a comparatively modest $26 million. But not everyone is happy about this development. A blog called politicalears.com posted an article stating that the Ice Bucket Challenge was a ""fraud"" because most of the money was being spent on administration and overhead. The unsigned post was picked up widely on social media feeds; that’s where PolitiFact readers noticed it. Several of them asked us to check it out, so we did. (The website has no contact information, so we were unable to reach the person who wrote the post.) Here are key excerpts from the Aug. 28 blog post, headlined, ""Ice bucket fraud: ALS Foundation admits that 73% of donations are not used for ALS research."" ""We've been duped. America is filled with fun-loving and caring people. The viral ice bucket challenge has combined both our sense of responsibility to our fellow human with fun. And it has been fun! Who didn't love seeing Sarah Palin doused?      ""But wait? Ice Bucket Challenge donations are nearing $100 MILLION. Where is that money going?     According to the ALS Foundation, not towards ALS. ""Over 73% of all donations raised are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations. Less than 27% is actually used for the purpose we donated for.      ""According to the ECFA, a charitable watchdog, 27% of donations actually making it to the cause they are donated to is unacceptable. In fact, the ECFA won't deem a non-profit as a reliable charity unless at least 80% of donations make it to their intended projects. ... ""The ALS Foundation is a terrible organization to send your money. If you decide to take the Ice Bucket Challenge, may I humbly suggest that you select a well-researched charity (on your own, no endorsements here) and send it to them."" The post reprints a pie chart taken directly from the ALS Association’s website, showing the following breakdown of expenses: Research: $7.2 million (27 percent) Patient and community services: $5.1 million (19 percent) Public and professional education: $8.5 million (32 percent) Fundraising: $3.6 million (14 percent) Administration: $1.9 million (7 percent) Let’s start by noting some comparatively minor problems. First, the group in question is the ALS Association, not the ""ALS Foundation,"" as the blog post calls it. Second, the ALS Association hasn’t said anything to ""admit"" the claims asserted in the blog post, as the post’s headline says. In fact, they’ve posted a response to it here. Now for the blog post’s biggest mistakes: • ""Over 73% of all donations raised are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations."" Not true. The 73 percent figure appears to come from subtracting everything except for the 27 percent that falls under ""research."" The charitable way (no pun intended) of viewing the post’s error is that it misread the category headings. If the post had simply said ""research accounts for only 27 percent of the ALS Association’s budget,"" that would be technically correct though still misleading, since the group’s mission statement includes several goals beyond directly sponsoring research. They include raising awareness, serving as a trusted source of information, providing patients with access to support services and advocating for increased funding for research. Once you include ""patient and community services"" and ""public and professional education"" as legitimate spending to advance the group’s stated mission, the percentage spent on items supporting those goals rises to nearly 79 percent. But the blog post actually exacerbated its error by specifically labeling 73 percent of the group’s spending as ""fundraising, overhead, executive salaries and external donations."" That’s flat wrong. We’ll add that if anyone wants to donate money to the association for research only, they can do that. ""If a donor would like 100% of their donation to go to research, he/she can simply check a box on our online donation form here,"" the association’s website says. ""If a donor already donated and would like to redirect their donation, please email us at [email protected]."" • The role of ECFA. The post cites standards by ECFA, the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, a group founded in 1979 that ""enhances trust in Christ-centered churches and ministries by establishing and applying Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship to accredited organizations."" However, when we contacted ECFA, Dan Busby, the group’s president, told PolitiFact that his group does not advance the argument made in the post. ""We were very surprised to see the ALS-related report which attributes certain statements to ECFA,"" Dan Busby, the group’s president, told PolitiFact. ""We did not provide any information for the story."" Busby added that, contrary to what the blog post said, his group doesn’t have a ""bright line"" test for a charity’s appropriate spending percentage. ""The data of applicants and members which reflect high overhead expenses are carefully analyzed for propriety,"" he said. ""In addition to considering the financial picture of a potential donee charity, we believe donors should also look at other attributes, including the charity's commitment to effective board governance, financial integrity, and appropriate accountability."" Other groups that analyze charities have given the ALS Association high scores. Charity Navigator, for instance, gave the ALS Association a score of four stars out of four for financial standards and transparency and accountability. The association is ""Top Rated"" by Charity Watch, is accredited by the Better Business Bureau and is a Guidestar Exchange gold participant. Our ruling The blog post said that ""over 73 percent of all donations raised (from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge) are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations."" Whether purposely or by incompetence, the anonymous blogger misreported the ALS Association’s figures. In reality, nearly 79 percent of the ALS Association’s expenditures were for purposes that advance its stated mission. Fundraising, overhead and executive salaries account for no more than 21 percent.

Larry Elder: If black America were a country, it'd be the 15th wealthiest nation in the world
","Conservative commentator Larry Elder and liberal CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill got into a heated argument recently after while discussing the situation in Ferguson, Mo. Elder accused the media of exaggerating American racism for political ends. ""As long as black people believe that race and racism are the major problem in America, you’ve got that 95 percent monolithic black vote without which the Democratic party cannot survive,"" Elder said. Elder used his father’s rise from janitor to small business owner as an example of what he called the ""thriving black middle class."" ""This is what happens in America,"" Elder said. ""If black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest country in the world. For crying out loud, this is not our grandfather’s America, and we ought not act like it is."" Fifteenth wealthiest, out of 196 countries, sounds impressive and worth checking out. Buying power of African-Americans Elder referred us to an annual report by Target Market News called ""The Buying Power of Black America,"" which publishes the only estimate we could find of the total earned income of African-Americans. In 2011, the report he provided us, Target Market News put the income spent by African-Americans at $836 billion. Elder got his talking point by comparing that figure to the World Bank’s list of each country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced. In 2011, ""black America's"" $836 billion would have put it in 16th, above Indonesia and below South Korea. (The Target Market News report is behind a paywall, so we can’t see precisely how they reached their figure. We asked if Target Market News would provide us a copy, but we didn't hear back.) Target Market News hasn’t published another estimate on African-American’s earned income since 2011, but a 2013 report by the Selig Center for Economic Growth pegs their contribution to the market at $1 trillion. That would also rank 16th -- above Indonesia and below Mexico. Case closed? Not really. Experts told us that there are two major problems with Elder’s methodology. Earned income vs. GDP First, earned income and GDP aren't quite the same thing. Comparing them isn’t fair, said NYU economics professor Gian Luca Clementi, ""because GDP is a concept that applies to a jurisdiction, not a group of people living in a jurisdiction."" GDP is ""a measure of the total income produced in a country,"" Clementi said, and factors like government expenditure and private investment mean that buying power and GDP aren't comparable. Second, Clementi said, ""a country's total GDP only gives a measure of the total income produced in the country. Anyone having the ambition of using GDP as a measure of average economic well-being, should start dividing by the number of residents."" Clementi used China as an example to better explain. While China has the world's second-highest GDP, ""its inhabitants are still a lot poorer than any Western country’s residents."" We took Clementi's suggestion and divided the most recent estimate of black earned income, $1 trillion, by the Census Bureau estimate of 44.5 million African-Americans. That would create a per capita buying power of around $23,000 a year, which would translate to around 34th around the world on the International Monetary Fund’s list of countries by GDP per capita (between the Bahamas and Malta). But $23,000 doesn’t go as far in the United States as, say, in Lithuania. Economists multiply GDP per capita by a conversion factor called purchasing power parity to account for the different values of goods and services in different countries. If you apply these factors, the African-American population’s $23,000 a year ranks 44th (between Portugal and Lithuania). Our ruling Arguing that racism is ""not a major problem,"" Elder said that ""if black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest in the world."" Elder took an estimate of African-Americans' total earned income ($836 billion in 2011) and looked at how it compared to national GDPs (it was actually 16th). But comparing earned income for a group of people to national GDPs isn’t a sound methodology, experts told us. The comparison falls more off the rails when you look at things on a per capita basis. In that scenario, black America’s buying power would rank around 44th when compared to countries’ per capita GDPs. We rate his claim False. Correction: Elder said racism was not a ""major"" problem.

Crist says Scott 'teamed up' with Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein to falsely attack him
","The Republican Party of Florida attacked former Gov. Charlie Crist in a TV ad alleging that he let Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein pick judicial appointments in exchange for campaign donations. Crist’s campaign fired back with its own ad Aug. 18 that included a slew of attacks on Scott, including this one: ""Now he’s teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist with false attacks."" The text on the screen states ""Rothstein gets 50 years in $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme."" Crist’s ad shows a photo of a grinning Rothstein wearing luxury watches and attributes that to an ABC News story from June 2010 when Rothstein was convicted. The Republicans’ ad about Rothstein used the same image. While the photo of Rothstein remains on the screen, the text of the ad says: ""Scott Rothstein bought expensive things"" and then the text on the screen says ""FALSE ATTACKS."" (The small print refers to a Sun-Sentinel article about an auction of Rothstein's possessions.) That’s a whole lot of Rothstein mash-up going on for viewers. For nearly five years, media reports have outlined how Rothstein donated generously to a long list of politicians including Crist. But this was the first we had heard of an allegation about Scott teaming up with Rothstein, so we decided to check it out. In fact, there is no evidence that Scott and Rothstein have literally ""teamed up"" -- what Crist is referring to is the Republican Party using the Rothstein scandal to attack Crist. The evidence that Crist cited in his ad backup was simply a news report about Rothstein’s conviction. ""Ponzi schemer's words + Rick Scott's money = teaming up,"" Brendan Gilfillan told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Here’s the backstory on Rothstein’s connection to Crist: Rothstein was a big campaign donor to Crist and the Republican Party back when Crist was still a Republican. And Crist did put Rothstein on a panel that recommended some appeals court judges. Rothstein testified that he gave money and in exchange directed Crist’s judicial picks to the appeals bench in West Palm Beach and the Broward bench. However, we found no hard evidence that proved Rothstein dictated Crist’s picks, so we rated that claim Half True. Rothstein exited Florida politics, and then Scott entered As soon as the news surfaced about the investigation into Rothstein, the long line of politicians and political entities opening their arms to receive his donations screeched to a halt. In fact, many of them gave the money back. Scott had the good fortune to avoid Rothstein due to his timing: He entered his first race for governor in April 2010. By that date, Rothstein was behind bars and no longer a mega-campaign donor. Federal authorities revealed they were investigating Rothstein’s scheme in November 2009 and arrested him Dec. 1, 2009. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in June 2010. Rothstein and his firm had given generously to candidates and politicians in both parties: as much as $3 million to local, state, federal candidates and political entities between 2005 and 2009. That included donations to Crist, the Republican Party of Florida and the Florida Democratic Party. So where was Scott during Rothstein’s scheme? Scott was a Republican millionaire businessman in Naples who built his career around the health care industry. Scott was forced out of the company he formed, Columbia/HCA, in 1997 amid lawsuits over Medicare billing practices that ultimately led to a $1.7 billion federal fine. In 2001, Scott cofounded Solantic Corp., a chain of walk-in urgent care centers he would later sell after he became governor. In 2009, Scott used $5 million of his own money to form Conservatives for Patients Rights to fight Obama’s health care reform. In 2010, he ran for governor. We asked Scott's campaign if Scott had ever crossed paths with Rothstein and did not get a response, but we could find no evidence that they had ever met. Our ruling Crist’s TV ad says Rick Scott has ""teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist with false attacks."" This ad is vague and confusing. Scott hasn’t teamed up with Ponzi schemer Rothstein -- he was arrested in December 2009 and Scott entered his first race for governor in April 2010. The only kind of teaming up that happened is that the Republican Party of Florida made a TV ad attacking Crist for his connections to Rothstein in an ad that PolitiFact Florida rated Half True.  Teaming up implies that Scott and Rothstein are in cahoots, and we’re not aware of any evidence that they crossed paths. When Scott announced his first campaign in April 2010, Rothstein had already been arrested and was awaiting sentencing.

Democratic group takes Terri Lynn Land's comments on equal pay out of context
","Terri Lynn Land, the Republican Senate candidate from Michigan, doesn’t think women should have guaranteed equal pay, says the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The committee recently released an ad attacking Land, who is running against Democratic Rep. Gary Peters in a tight race for Michigan’s open Senate seat. The ad takes clips from one of Land’s own videos -- where she says that as a woman, she knows more about women’s issues than Peters -- and alternates them with claims about Land’s positions on women’s issues. Such as: ""Terri Lynn Land said guaranteeing equal pay for women who do the same job as men is not a good idea."" We’ve looked into equal pay before, checking the oft-cited claim that women make 77 cents for every dollar men earn. The accuracy of statements about gender and pay depends a lot on how they're phrased. But when speaking of the pay gap overall, it's Mostly True. So we decided to figure out whether Land really said that it’s a bad idea to guarantee equal pay. We found that the DSCC twisted her words. Out of context The claim refers to an interview regarding pay equality that Land gave to the Wall Street Journal back in April, in which she did say the phrase: ""I don’t think that’s a good idea."" But the ad takes that quote out of context. The Journal asked Land if she would have voted for the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed to pass the Senate that same week. Land -- like others in her party, including Republican women -- said she supports equal pay but not that legislation in particular. The legislation is built off of the Equal Pay Act and would have required employers to prove that pay differences are not gender-based, and it would have prevented employers from punishing employees who inquire or complain about pay concerns. Additionally, employers would have been liable to civil action law suits, which was a concern among Republicans. Land incorrectly told the Journal that her problem with the legislation is that it would require businesses to publicly disclose individuals’ pay. (The law doesn’t have such a provision.) Land has said that existing law already protects equal pay for women; in her platform on women’s issues, she pointed to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Some Republicans have argued that the Paycheck Fairness Act is redundant because discriminatory pay is already illegal. On this year’s Women’s Equality Day -- Aug. 26 -- Land released a statement once again supporting the Equal Pay Act and criticizing Peters for supposedly unequal pay in his own office. This isn’t the first time that Land has had to defend her position on equal pay during this race. In April -- before Land’s interview with the Journal -- American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal political action committee, circulated a 20-second video of Land speaking to a women’s club in 2010. The isolated clip makes it seem that Land believes women aren’t interested in seeking out equal pay. ""Well, we all like to be paid more, and that's great. But the reality is that women have a different lifestyle,"" Land said in the video. ""They have kids, they have to take them to get dentist appointments, doctors appointments all those kinds of things, and they're more interested in flexibility in a job than pay."" We found a video of the full 30-minute speech and were able to put the short clip in context. She was talking about her experience as a county clerk and union leader in Kent County, Mich., where she noticed that male leaders often negotiated for pay raises. Instead, she chose to negotiate for more job flexibility for her and the female employees she represented (such as making it easier for parents to take time off to care for sick children). Here’s a more representative quote: ""About 85 percent of my employees were women. Well, the (union) is a little male organization, have you ever noticed that?"" she said. ""And of course, they always negotiated for money, for raises. Well, we all like to be paid more and that's great but the reality is that women have a different lifestyle. They have kids, they have to take them to get dentist appointments, doctors appointments all those kinds of things, and they're more interested in flexibility in a job than pay -- although pay is important, too. So we went out and fought those issues for them."" Our ruling The Democratic Senatorial Congressional Committee said ""Terri Lynn Land said guaranteeing equal pay for women who do the same job as men is not a good idea."" The ad twisted Land’s words -- she said the Paycheck Fairness Act was ""not a good idea,"" not the general concept of guaranteeing equal pay for women. We can’t read Land’s mind to know whether or not she truly believes in equal pay for women, but as far as we can tell, she never said publicly that it’s a bad idea.

Kaine gets B+ on his own geography quiz
","Sen. Tim Kaine tweeted out a geography quiz on a recent visit to Southwestern Virginia. ""When I stood at Pinnacle Overlook above the Cumberland Gap today, I was closer to 8 other state capitals than to Richmond,"" Kaine wrote on Aug. 20. ""Can you name them?"" The Pinnacle Overlook is part of the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park in the Southwest corner of Virginia. Sitting 2,440 feet high, it offers scenic views of three states: Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.

Tom DeLay says prosecutor who brought Rick Perry indictment has ties to Obama, Democrats
","CNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley consulted an interesting source to discuss Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s indictment on charges of abusing his power: former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a fellow Texas Republican who has been embroiled in a criminal election law violation for the past 12 years. Perry’s charges are nothing short of a political witch hunt, DeLay said, just like his own. Crowley pushed back on the suggestion. ""The point is the prosecutor who brought the indictment is not a Democrat in any way anybody can see, and in fact has ties to Republicans,"" Crowley said. ""That’s not true. Candy, that’s not true,"" DeLay said. ""He has ties to Obama. He has ties to the Democrats."" ""And he has ties to Republicans, yes?"" Crowley asked. ""Well yeah, but that has nothing to do with this,"" DeLay said. ""What has to do with this is you take a law and you twist it so you can get the indictment. That is prosecutorial misconduct, whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat."" We wanted to look into the special prosecutor’s political connections, since Crowley and DeLay seemed to be on different pages. True colors The special prosecutor, who was not identified on air, is San Antonio lawyer Michael McCrum. A grand jury indicted Perry based on charges brought forth by McCrum that Perry misused his power, after Perry threatened to veto the budget of an Austin prosecutor if she did not resign after her DUI was caught on tape. Our partners at PolitiFact Texas laid out the legal history of the case against Perry, noting how the prosecutor, Lehmberg, recused herself from the case, and the public integrity unit she leads was uninvolved in picking McCrum. McCrum was selected by Judge Bert Richardson, a Republican appointee of President George W. Bush. Richardson and McCrum both worked as prosecutors in San Antonio, according to the Texas Tribune. McCrum has been tight-lipped in press accounts and did not respond to our request for an interview. Solomon Wisenberg, a former Texas prosecutor who worked with McCrum and considers him an ""old friend,"" called the allegation against McCrum ""pathetic on its face."" ""Mike would not be engaged in a political witch hunt. The idea that he’s politically motivated is ridiculous,"" Wisenberg said. ""I don’t really consider him as a political person."" The records show McCrum has steered clear of partisanship, even as he has attracted support from both sides of the aisle over 25 years. In 1989, McCrum served as a federal prosecutor in the Western District of Texas, according to his resume.  In 2000, McCrum opened his own private practice in San Antonio, focusing on criminal defense. In 2009, President Barack Obama nominated McCrum to be the U.S. attorney in San Antonio, according to the Texas Tribune. His nomination was called a ""consensus choice"" by justice trade publication Main Justice, and Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison and House Democrats supported McCrum for the job. But McCrum withdrew his name in 2010, as the prolonged nomination process stalled his law practice, according to the Wall Street Journal.   The White House did not provide comment. McCrum does not appear to vote in primaries and has donated to candidates of both parties. The Austin-American Statesman detailed McCrum’s political donations: In 2007, he contributed $300 to a Republican 4th Court of Appeals candidate, $500 to a former Democratic congressman, and $500 to Republican Bert Richardson’s unsuccessful re-election bid as state district judge.   This record of bipartisanship is not unusual nor undesired in special prosecutors, said Wisenberg, who considers himself a conservative and opposes the prosecution against DeLay. He pointed out that special prosecutor Ken Starr, famous for investigating President Bill Clinton, also had ties to both parties, and DeLay did not oppose him. The ruling DeLay said it’s ""not true"" that McCrum isn’t a Democrat, saying ""he has ties to Obama (and) he has ties to Democrats."" McCrum has loose ties to Obama and Democrats -- and he has Republican ones, too. News reports and McCrum’s political record show he is not expressly partisan, having contributing a few hundred dollars to a few people on both sides of the aisle. There's a sliver of truth in DeLay's statement, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Peter King: U.S. had 'allies lined up' for air strikes in Syria before Obama 'pulled the rug out'
","Sunday marked the one-year point from President Barack Obama’s Aug. 31, 2013, Rose Garden address seeking congressional approval to conduct air strikes in Syria against Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Twelve months later, the situation in Syria remains a troubling international crisis, amplified by the growing presence of the terrorist group Islamic State, also known as ISIS, throughout the region. Across all five major Sunday political shows, Republicans — and even some Democrats — criticized the administration’s response to the unrest, with many politicians and pundits leaching on to Obama’s remark Thursday that ""we don’t have a strategy yet"" for dealing with the Islamic State. Among the critics was Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who said on CBS’ Face the Nation, ""I wish our president was showing the same leadership that (British Prime Minister) David Cameron
showed. What is President Obama waiting for?"" ""It was a year ago this all started,"" King added. ""I remember being in the White House with (White House Chief of Staff) Denis McDonough talking about the importance of air attacks in Syria, and we had allies lined up and then the president pulled the rug out. And those allies are going to be very hard now to get back into a coalition."" We looked at a similar claim in March, when former Vice President Dick Cheney said, ""a lot of the allies signed on (for airstrikes in Syria). At the last minute, Obama backed off."" We rated that statement Mostly False. Given the recent developments, we thought King’s comments about what happened a year ago deserved a review. Unlike Cheney, King does not go so far as to claim ""a lot of allies signed on"" to air strikes. The push to intervene in Syria came to a head on Aug. 21, 2013, when the Assad regime attacked a rebel-held area on the outskirts of Damascus using chemical weapons. A year earlier, Obama had said ""a red line for (military intervention) is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized."" Within a week of the attack, the administration was talking about launching air strikes at weapon depots and military command centers in Syria. To do so, Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry tried to garner support from the international community. Leaders in France and Britain immediately jumped on board the idea of limited air strikes. On Aug. 27, 2013, French President Francois Hollande said, ""France is ready to punish those who took the heinous decision to gas innocents."" A top British official was quoted as saying it was ""reasonable to assume our armed forces are making contingency plans."" But Prime Minister Cameron suffered an embarrassing rebuke Aug. 29, 2013, at the hands of Parliament — controlled by his own party — which narrowly voted to defeat a motion to support military intervention in Syria. According to the Telegraph, it was ""the first time that a British Government has been blocked from executing a military deployment."" Cameron later called off a military deployment. Support among the other European states was equally hard to find. Italy said it would only go along if the U.N. Security Council approved the use of force (which didn’t happen). Germany, seen as a pivotal player, was clearly against military action. Germany signed on to a G20 statement that called the use of poisonous gas a war crime and said the Syrian government was the likely culprit. But the statement added, ""The EU underscores at the same time the need to move forward with addressing the Syrian crisis through the U.N. process."" The strongest legal justification for an air strike would come through the U.N. Security Council. That was impossible to achieve since two permanent members, Russia and China, had made it clear they would veto any such resolution. Within NATO, Turkey was a major proponent of intervention. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was the most eager to see an attack on Syria, a long-time political foe. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were also on board. However, the Arab League, which includes Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, never approved a military strike. In the end, the most significant show of unity with allies was a Sept. 6 joint statement between the United States and Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom calling for ""a strong international response to this grave violation of the world’s rules and conscience that will send a clear message that this kind of atrocity can never be repeated. Those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable."" However, a ""strong international response"" was never defined, and eventually even France said it wanted to wait for a final report from U.N. chemical weapons inspectors. King also claimed support among allies dissipated because Obama ""pulled the rug out"" from plans to launch air strikes. It’s unclear exactly what moment King is referencing (his staff did not respond to an email seeking further explanation). But widespread hesitance to intervene among the international community was palpable from the start. Even before Obama sought congressional support for targeted military strikes on Aug. 31, 2013, — as opposed to unilateral action — Britain had already voted against any military action. It’s true Obama had a hand in shelving military action when the United States and Russia struck a deal that sidelined the use of force in exchange for Syria giving up its chemical weapons (which has since been completed). At that point, an international movement for significant military intervention dissipated since the source of the angst — Assad’s use of chemical weapons — was eliminated. But support was already fading anyway. Our ruling King said, ""we had allies lined up (to launch air strikes on Syria) then the president pulled the rug out."" A handful of allies ""lined up"" for air strikes. We counted France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as countries that were supportive. Hardly an overwhelming show of hands, but King did not specify how many in his remarks. Among the ""no"" crowd were key allies like the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. The Arab League and the United Nations also balked. Any support faded after Russia helped broker a diplomatic solution in which Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/31/peter-king/peter-king-us-had-allies-lined-air-strikes-syria-o/
"['Jobs', 'Message Machine 2014', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says Wisconsin third in Midwest in jobs created
","A new television ad from Gov. Scott Walker returns to the theme of job creation and paints an upbeat picture of how Wisconsin is faring. Working to blunt criticism from Democratic challenger Mary Burke that his administration has failed to deliver on his No. 1 campaign promise to add 250,000 private sector jobs, Walker compares Wisconsin with other Midwest states. In the ad, outlines of states appear on the screen as Walker speaks directly to the camera: ""Well, the latest job numbers are in and Wisconsin created more private sector jobs than Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, and Illinois. That means we ranked third in the Midwest."" With Burke repeatedly claiming Wisconsin is ""dead last"" in job creation in the Midwest, we thought it was time to look at both claims. As with the Burke claim, many factors are at work, including the time frame and the measure being used. About the numbers Walker doesn’t say it to the camera, but fine print on the screen says the ad’s claim is based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics (CES) for the period of July 2013 to July 2014. He’s talking about the most recent one-year period, not his entire term. Wisconsin added 36,100 jobs in that one-year time frame, which does place it third among the 10 Midwest states, behind Indiana and Michigan. Here is how the picture looks:   States ranked by on growth in number of jobs, July 2013-14 Private-sector jobs added National rank on jobs added 1. Indiana 66,300 8th 2. Michigan 58,200 11th 3. Wisconsin 36,100 20th 4. Minnesota 33,600 21st 5. Ohio 29,900 24th 6. Illinois 28,700 25th 7. North Dakota 19,000 29th 8. Iowa 15,200 33rd 9. Nebraska 4,200 45th 10. South Dakota 3,000 48th In the comparison, Walker used preliminary July 2014 data, which will be adjusted in one month. A Bureau of Labor Statistics official said it was reasonable to compare that figure to the July 2013 figure, with the caveat that the July 2014 figure will change. Behind the numbers A subtle but important note: In his claim, Walker uses the raw number of jobs created as his measuring stick -- not the percentage increase, which is the measure preferred by economists. Using the percentage change allows for a better comparison, due to the varying size of states. That is, smaller states like South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa have fewer people and a smaller economic base to start from. But it’s notable that even on that measure, Wisconsin outperformed states with larger economies and populations such as Ohio and Illinois over the last year. And when the percentage growth is used, Wisconsin only slips a bit -- to fourth-highest among the 10. Another point to consider, also important, is Walker’s use of the monthly jobs data. Those monthly numbers are extrapolated from a survey of 3 percent of state businesses. As such, they are subject to considerable revisions and include a wide margin of error. Walker himself has called the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which is based on a census of 96 percent of employers, the ""gold standard"" for jobs. Not long after taking office, Walker’s spokesman issued an email statement in March 2011 saying the governor would use the quarterly data because of his ""commitment to use verifiable, actual job counts, not just monthly job estimates."" That said, in the new ad, Walker does signal he’s using the monthly estimates this time -- he refers to ""the latest"" numbers, which go through July 2014. By contrast, the more-accurate quarterly data lags behind by six months. The most recent quarterly data ends with the last quarter of 2013. Campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marre told us that timeliness was one factor in the campaign’s use of the monthly numbers. And we think it is defensible to use it to provide insight into the latest trends. It is regularly used and reported by economists and news outlets. In our own Walk-O-Meter, as we track progress toward Walker’s 250,000 private-sector job pledge, we use the solid quarterly jobs figures from 2011, 2012 and 2013 to provide the best picture for the first three full years of Walker’s term. Then, to give a sense of the most recent pictures, we use the most recent monthly jobs numbers. Our most recent tally shows 147,187 jobs to go. We have rated the promise Stalled. Finally, Walker defined the ""Midwest"" as 10 states -- the same states Burke used in her claim. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ midwest regional office covers those 10 states, and typically cites only the 10. In some instances, the agency adds two more -- Missouri and Kansas. Wisconsin ranks fourth of 12 on raw number of jobs added in the year. Our rating Walker’s new TV ad says the latest jobs figures show Wisconsin is third in the Midwest on the number of jobs created. The number checks out, using the measuring stick and timeframe Walker chose. To be sure, the monthly numbers he uses are not as reliable as quarterly ones, which Walker himself has labeled the ""gold standard."" But by using raw numbers to measure the increase, instead of a percentage-based approach that levels the playing field, he gives Wisconsin -- and himself -- a bit of a boost. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True. ...... Deciphering jobs claims Voters will hear many more jobs claims before the Nov. 4 election. Here are five tips for separating fact from fiction -- and hype from hard evidence -- when it comes to candidates and the numbers they use. Check the timeframe: If the statement covers a short period, it can be a red flag for cherry-picking data to find a good result. A longer time frame may be being used to mask more recent changes. Check the data source: The quarterly jobs numbers are more accurate than the monthly figures, but also more out of date. Be more skeptical of recent announcement about the monthly numbers, because they are subject to revisions can be significant. Raw numbers or percentages?: If the claim is that State X added more jobs than State Y, the statement may have limited information value. Look for percentage growth figures that level the playing field among states of varying sizes. Check the map: When the claim is ""best in the region,"" trust but verify. Are all relevant states included? Scrutinize the sector: Most claims focus on just the private sector, but sometimes partisans will add in public employees if it suits their purpose.  ",/factchecks/2014/aug/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-third-midwest-jobs-cre/

Mary Burke says Wisconsin ranks last in Midwest job growth
","If Mary Burke has said it once, she’s said it a thousand times: ""Wisconsin’s dead last in Midwest job growth."" The Democratic candidate for governor uses the line in TV ads, in interviews and her stump speech, all aimed at countering Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s message that ""Wisconsin is back on"" after the Great Recession. Burke’s allies repeat the claim. One example, from a Burke campaign television spot that first aired in July 2014: ""It’s Walker’s agency that gave millions in tax breaks to companies that relocated jobs overseas. Another reason Wisconsin’s dead last in Midwest job growth."" As this is spoken, the TV spot rolls through a list of nine states before settling on Wisconsin at the bottom: North Dakota, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. With a new Walker TV ad bragging that we’re third in the Midwest in job growth, we thought it was time to look at both claims. In both cases, and like so many claims in a campaign that any numbers nerd would love, evaluation depends on two things: the timeframe and the measuring stick. In the Burke ad, the narrator in the spot doesn’t say what time frame was analyzed. But the fine print in the ad cites data collected for the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. And the footnote says the ad compares quarter four of 2010 -- the last before Walker took office -- to quarter four of 2013. That is still the latest available quarterly data. That data, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is considered the most exhaustive and credible for employment trends. It is based on a census of 96 percent of all American non-farm employers. Our examination of the data for the three-year period cited by Burke shows Wisconsin 10th out of the 10 states --  ""dead last"" -- just below Illinois when it comes to growth in private-sector jobs. ""The low growth in jobs in Wisconsin has been matched by very low income growth and poor levels of consumer spending,"" University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee labor economist John Heywood told us. ""The state has been slower than its peers in recovering from the recession."" Nationally, Wisconsin ranked 35th. Here’s the regional picture: State and midwest ranking on percentage growth in jobs Dec. 2010-Dec. 2013 Percentage change in employment National rank on percentage change 1. North Dakota 21.90% 1st 2. Michigan 8.71% 6th 3. Indiana 6.88% 15th 4. Minnesota 6.29% 20th 5. Nebraska 5.71% 24th 6. Ohio 5.65% 25th 7. South Dakota 5.28% 27th 8. Iowa 5.20% 28th 9. Illinois 4.21% 33th 10. Wisconsin 4.04% 35th Burke ranks the states by the percentage of growth. That is preferred by economists for state-by-state comparisons because it shows performance regardless of the state’s population. By another measure -- raw number of jobs created -- Wisconsin ranked sixth-best of the 10 states, we found. Limitations to the data There are two statistical points to consider. The most important is the definition of ""Midwest."" Both Burke and Walker use the 10 states we mentioned. There’s a good case to be made for that: The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Midwest regional office covers those 10 states. We found other instances in which the agency adds Missouri and Kansas into the Midwestern mix, for a total of 12 states. In that larger group, Wisconsin finishes 11th of 12, ahead of Missouri. Previously we rated Half True a Burke claim in January 2014 that Wisconsin was last in the Midwest. The numbers worked out, but we faulted Burke mainly for a too-narrow comparison. She said Midwest, but looked only at the four states adjoining Wisconsin. We noted that at that time, before the 2013 numbers were complete, that Ohio and Nebraska (from the group of 10) and Missouri (from the more expansive BLS group of 12) had slower growth rates than Wisconsin. Finally, because it’s so comprehensive, reporting of the quarterly jobs data lags by at least six months, meaning the picture may be a bit outdated by the time it is released. The next quarterly jobs figures, covering the first quarter of 2014, are set for mid-September release. There is more recent jobs data available, from the monthly Current Employment Statistics surveys, but it’s based on a sample of only about 3 percent of employers. Those figures are prone to large margins of error but are also a widely cited source on job trends. Walker has called the quarterly data the ""gold standard,"" and has criticized the monthly data. But he has cited the monthly data, and does so in his new ad. Burke has used both at various times as well. Indeed, she was using the less-reliable monthly data back when we rated her earlier worst-in-Midwest claim Half True. Our rating Mary Burke contends that ""Wisconsin’s dead last in Midwest job growth."" In the new version of this claim, she uses the most accurate jobs data for the longest Walker-era period that can be analyzed with it. And Wisconsin does bring up the rear. But due to the lag time, it does not reflect the most current trends. We rate the claim True. ...... Deciphering jobs claims Voters will hear many more jobs claims before the Nov. 4 election. Here are five tips for separating fact from fiction -- and hype from hard evidence -- when it comes to candidates and the numbers they use.

Wendy Davis says Greg Abbott let millions in taxpayer dollars go to wealthy gift-giving donors
","In a TV ad unveiled Aug. 23, 2014, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis suggested sinister ties between her Republican opponent and a scandal-tinged Texas agency that funds cancer research. In the spot, a Fort Worth man identified as cancer survivor Manuel Alvarado says: ""When you’re battling cancer, you pray for a cure. But Greg Abbott did his best to keep my prayers from being answered."" Abbott, Alvarado says, ""was charged with overseeing the state cancer research fund. But he let his wealthiest donors take tens of millions of taxpayer dollars without proper oversight. They showered Abbott with gifts and free vacations and and they made off with money that was meant to find a cure."" Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, has previously sought to implicate Abbott, the state attorney general, in the scandal that two years ago engulfed the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. In May 2014, according to an Austin American-Statesman news story, she maintained that Abbott campaign donors also were investors in companies that received improperly-vetted institute grants. Jerry Strickland, Abbott’s state spokesman, countered that the attorney general’s office had been involved in an investigation leading to the 2013 Travis County indictment of Gerald ""Jerry"" Cobbs, a former institute executive involved in awarding an $11 million grant to Peloton Therapeutics even though the biotech startup had not gone through the necessary outside scientific review. Cobbs awaits trial. So, was Abbott charged with overseeing the anti-cancer fund? Did he let campaign donors take tens of millions in taxpayer dollars? And did the donors shower him with gifts and vacations? Abbott and the anti-cancer institute Per the 2007 law setting up the institute, its governing body, or oversight committee, consisted of nine appointed members plus the attorney general or the attorney general’s designee and the state comptroller or the comptroller’s designee. Starting in 2009, that committee had the unprecedented job of awarding millions of dollars to cancer-related projects after Texas voters approved the issuance of $3 billion in bonds over 10 years ""to fund groundbreaking cancer research and prevention programs and services in Texas,"" the institute says on its website. The 2013 Legislature, reacting to red flags including grants being bestowed despite scientific misgivings, shrank the oversight committee. Its nine members would continue to be appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor and Texas House speaker, but the revised law lifted the mandate that the attorney general and state comptroller or respective designees serve, according to a July 2013 Senate Research Center summary of the changes. Also new: Anyone named to the panel must disclose to the institute each political contribution to a candidate for a state or federal office over $1,000 made by the person in the five years preceding the person's appointment and each year after the person's appointment until the person's term expired, with the institute posting a summary each year, the center wrote. To our inquiry, a Davis spokesman, Zac Petkanas, said the Democrat’s August ad was based on news stories and editorials. Among the stories, a May 11, 2013, account in the Dallas Morning News said Abbott hadn’t attended any of the board’s 23 meetings to that date. By email, Strickland told us Abbott never cast a committee vote on a ""grant, nor was he involved in any grant request, review or award."" The News story quoted Abbott saying that picking a high-ranking state assistant to take his place ""allowed me to retain the independence to take action to respond to any broader challenges posed by CPRIT."" Strickland told us Abbott’s designee on the committee, James ""Jay"" Dyer, voted like other board members at meetings he attended though he also was unaware of issues surrounding grants that came into question because they were due to ""misconduct, mismanagement and disclosure failures"" by the institute’s senior staff, Strickland said. In December 2012, the attorney general’s office announced it was looking into institute operations. Strickland told us a forensics unit in the office helped Travis County’s investigation by recovering deleted emails and data files that  institute staff claimed had been lost. ""Because the matter investigated by this office in conjunction with the Public Integrity Unit is currently the subject of an ongoing prosecution,"" Strickland said, ""our investigation is not closed and we cannot comment further on this matter."" In January 2013, after Travis County began the inquiry that led to the institute executive’s indictment, the county's district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, said committee members (presumably including Abbott) ""are not under suspicion in the investigation,"" the Statesman said in a news story at the time. But Lehmberg did not clear the whole institute, saying ""we are far from finished in our efforts."" By that day, the story said, three top executives had resigned and left the cancer-fighting agency. The institute and Abbott donors News stories cited by Davis have pointed out major donors to Republican candidates with connections to entities that received institute awards, though we saw no stories indicating millions of dollars went directly to Abbott donors. According to the 2013 News’ story, on June 18, 2010, the institute oversight committee ratified the $11 million award to Peloton Therapeutics, described as using laboratory discoveries at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center to try to develop anti-cancer drugs. That grant was given without the required business or scientific review, the story said, and with Abbott’s designee absent from the meeting. The News reported that three committee members who ratified the award to Peloton had contributed $150,000 since 2002 to Abbott’s campaigns. Among them: Charles Tate, a Houston investor who had ponied up $140,000 to Abbott’s campaigns, the paper said. Of that, the story said, Tate contributed $100,000 in November 2012, which would have been about three weeks before Abbott’s office announced its institute probe. The newspaper said at least one Peloton investor also had Abbott ties. Dallas philanthropist Peter O’Donnell, one of Peloton’s financial backers, had contributed $130,000 to Abbott’s campaigns since 2001, the story said. O’Donnell earlier said he invested in Peloton in July 2011, more than a year after the oversight committee ratified the award, the paper reported. O’Donnell was connected to another spotlighted institute grant. In January 2013, the Texas state auditor, John Keel, issued an audit raising questions about the agency's biggest grant, $25.2 million awarded in June 2010 to the Statewide Clinical Trials Network of Texas, CTNeT, which was created to speed clinical trials of cancer drugs, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time. The Chronicle said the grant's ""receiving agent"" was Carolyn Bacon Dickson, executive director of the O'Donnell Foundation, tied to Peter O'Donnell. Keel said in the audit that like the grant to Peloton, the award to CTNeT was bestowed despite the absence of a favorable recommendation by peer scientists. Around the time of the state audit, CTNeT ceased operations after the institute cut off its funding, according to a Jan. 29, 2013, Statesman news story. The Davis campaign suggested another nefarious -- though indirect -- connection to the CTNeT grant. Steve Hicks of Austin, who has donated $193,000 to Abbott’s campaigns, according to a March 1, 2014, news story in the San Antonio Express-News, is executive chairman of Capstar Partners, an investment firm where a partner, John Cullen, was described in a July 2011 institute foundation report as a member of CTNeT’s board of directors. (Our check of state records showed Cullen, identified as manager of Mood Media Consulting, gave $1,000 to Abbott’s kitty Sept. 26, 2013.) Petkanas mentioned another Abbott backer with an institute connection. A July 27, 2013, Chronicle news story said San Antonio businessman James Leininger, described as donating $289,000 to Abbott’s campaigns since 2001, had a biotechnology company, Caliber Biotherapuetics, that received $12 million from the institute to carry out a proposal despite receiving low scores from reviewers. According to a Nov. 2, 2011, publication on the institute’s website, the institute approved a $12.8 million grant for the company, based in Bryan-College Station, to tap hydroponic plants to devise a better antibody therapy against two types of cancer. Caliber Biotherapeutics isn’t Leininger’s company. But it lists as its sole institutional investor Medcare Investment Funds, which on its website lists Leininger as its founder. When we called Nashville-based Medcare, the person who answered the phone said Leininger continues to be involved, though she declined to elaborate or to be identified before referring us to a San Antonio telephone number where our request for detail didn’t generate information. To our telephone and email inquiries, Caliber Biotherapeutics and Leininger each offered no comment. Shower of gifts, vacations? By email, Petkanas initially told us Leininger was the campaign’s example of gifts and travel showered on Abbott by donors with a stake in entities that drew grants from the institute. The 2014 Express-News story said Leininger had paid for Abbott and his family’s travel and accommodations three times between 2008 and 2010, according to Abbott’s state-filed personal financial statements. Every state official must report any gift worth more than $250. We confirmed the described Leininger-funded trips (one each in 2008, 2009 and 2010) from Abbott’s filings; none of the entries called the listed trip a vacation while Abbott’s camp didn’t immediately reply when we asked if the gifted trips were vacations. Hicks -- the investor whose firm’s partner, Cullen, was a CTNeT board member -- joined with his wife, Donna, in giving Abbott a travel guide membership in 2009, Abbott reported. Our ruling Davis said Abbott was ""charged with overseeing the state cancer research fund. But he let his wealthiest donors take tens of millions of taxpayer dollars without proper oversight. They showered Abbott with gifts and free vacations."" There’s something here, but Davis leaves out substantive details. Abbott was on a big committee created to oversee institute awards though he designated an aide to act in his stead, not once attending. Also unsaid is that Abbott’s office helped Travis County’s investigation leading to an institute staff member’s indictment; the local district attorney also said committee members weren’t suspected of wrongdoing. A major Abbott donor gave three trips, valued at more than $250 each, to Abbott’s family, but contrary to the ad’s message, that isn’t the same as all the campaign donors connected to institute grants showering Abbott with gifts and free vacations. On balance, we rate this statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Scott Walker gave $10,000 private school tax break to millionaires, AFL-CIO says
","In a mass-mail piece headlined ""Falling Behind,"" the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO contends that under Wisconsin’s Republican governor, working families have suffered at the expense of the well-to-do. The four-page flier goes on to make a number of attacks, including this one: ""What’s really troubling is that Scott Walker has given a $10,000 tax deduction to millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools. Some have asked why Walker is giving a tax break to millionaires who can afford tuition costs rather than investing in the children who are being educated in public schools. Working families are still waiting for an answer."" So, did Walker carve out a $10,000 private-school tax break strictly to benefit millionaires? What happened The AFL-CIO hasn’t been alone in decrying the tax measure, adopted as part of the 2013-’15 state budget, which is for students from kindergarten through high school. The Wisconsin Budget Project, part of the liberal Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, criticized it for being larger than the tax deduction available for college tuition.  Meanwhile, the Republican chairman of the state Senate Education Committee praised the tax break because it ""might make it easier for parents to afford private school if they feel that is the best option for their children.""  Here’s how it works: Beginning in the 2014 tax year, for tax returns due in April 2015, taxpayers can subtract from their income amounts paid to private schools for tuition and mandatory student fees. The schools can be inside or outside of Wisconsin, although expenses such as room and board can’t be deducted. For each student in kindergarten through eighth grade, the maximum deduction is $4,000; for each student in high school, the maximum is $10,000.  An important point: The deductions are available to any individuals, regardless of income, including millionaires.  Taxpayer impact The deduction will amount to a state income tax cut for the typical family of up to roughly $240 for each elementary school student and $600 for each high school student, according to a rough calculation by the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office.  Percentage-wise, the savings have a bigger impact on taxpayers with lower incomes, although it wouldn’t be enough by itself for many lower-income families to pay for a private school. Viewed another way, the state is expected to collect $30 million per year less in tax revenue as a result of the tax break.  The AFL-CIO argues that, in light of cuts Walker made to public school aid with his 2011-’13 budget, the $30 million is yet more money that could be invested in public schools rather than for reducing taxes for people who are arguably on the higher end of the income scale.  The conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute observed, however, that the reduced revenue could be offset if the tax break enticed more students -- about 3,000 -- to move to private schools. That’s because public schools get state taxpayer aid based on how many students they have.  While many private-school students come from wealthier families, many others come from families with more modest incomes. Before we close, let’s consider one other perspective.  In June 2013, days before the tax break became law, state public schools superintendent Tony Evers declared it ""the most generous in the nation."" We rated his claim Half True. We found that in comparison to the five other states that offered either a private school tax deduction, or tax credit, Wisconsin’s tax break is among the most generous -- for parents with multiple children attending a private high school, for example.  But depending on various factors, it's not necessarily more generous than other states. Our rating The state AFL-CIO said Walker ""has given a $10,000 tax deduction to millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools."" There is an element of truth, in that millionaires do benefit from the tax break. But so do taxpayers of other income levels who send their kids to private schools. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/31/wisconsin-state-afl-cio/scott-walker-gave-10000-tax-break-millionaires-afl/

Gina Raimondo says Providence's pension fund has remained critically underfunded under Angel Taveras

","Public employee pensions have been a hot topic in the 2014 primary race for governor because two of the Democratic candidates have had to deal with underfunded plans. During the Aug. 26, 2014 Providence Journal - WPRI debate between Democrats Clay Pell, General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, Raimondo and Taveras swapped barbs about who has administered their respective pension funds most effectively. Taveras, who got concessions from the city's unions, said the state pension fund is underperforming and paying excessive fees. Raimondo, whose changes in the state fund sparked a lawsuit that remains unresolved, countered that ""we have great returns with lower risk,"" and she fired back at Taveras. ""The pension fund in the city of Providence is only 30-percent funded, about the same level as when he [Taveras] took office,"" she said. ""[I] fixed a system for the long term. He made small changes and the pension system in Providence is still in crisis."" (The U.S. Government Accountability Office recommends that  public pension plans should be at least 80 percent funded.) We were curious about what the trend has been in Providence and whether the funding has gone down. We asked the Raimondo campaign for its evidence. Spokesman Eric Hyers sent us links to two documents. The first was a Jan. 19, 2012 report from Providence's pension adviser, Buck Consultants, which tracks funding going back to 1994, when the city had 57.4 percent of the pension money it needed. Since then, the overall trend has been down. The funded ratio had plummeted to 39.3 percent by the last full fiscal year Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. was in office. It had dropped to 34.1 percent by June 30, 2010, when David Cicilline, now a U.S. representative,  was in his last year. A year later, when Taveras had been in office for six months, the funded ratio had dropped to 31.94 percent. The second document was the Jan. 31, 2014 valuation report by the city's new pension adviser, Segal Consulting. It reports that as of June 30, 2013, with Taveras in office two and a half years, the funded ratio was virtually the same -- 31.39 percent. And this was after Taveras won union concessions to reduce pension costs. By comparison, the funded ratio for the state employees plan went from 48.4 percent in June 2010, before Raimondo took office, to 56.2 percent as of June 30, 2013 in the most recent audit. Michael D'Amico, Taveras' former director of administration who is now a budget consultant for the city, said it was ""a complete oversimplification"" to imply that the changes were small because the funded ratio didn't change significantly. The actual cost of the pension system was reduced substantially by negotiating changes such as a 10-year suspension of cost-of-living raises and the elimination of 5- and 6-percent compounded cost of living adjustments, D’Amico said. ""We got just about as much as we possibly could have without cutting pensions,"" said Taveras spokesman David Ortiz. ""In a sense, the administration faced a choice: do we push Providence into bankruptcy to give a receiver the ability to cut pensions? ""The mayor believed the cost and collateral damage of pushing Rhode Island’s capital city into bankruptcy was not worth extra pension savings we would have been able to pursue,"" Ortiz said. Said D'Amico: ""If we hadn't done anything, the funded ratio would have been much lower."" Our ruling When Raimondo said, ""The pension fund in the city of Providence is only 30 percent funded, about the same level as when he [Taveras] took office,"" she was only off by one percentage point, according to the most recent audit of the fund. That funded ratio has not increased since Taveras was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2011. But that percentage was on a downward spiral at the time, so having it stabilize at 31 percent doesn't necessarily reflect ""small changes,"" as Raimondo claimed in the debate. And the changes negotiated between Taveras and the city’s unions are intended to gradually increase the funding ratio. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Burger King says it's 'not moving' and 'will continue to pay all' of its taxes
","When Burger King, the American fast-food icon, announced a deal to join forces with the Canadian coffee-and-donuts giant Tim Hortons, the reaction was swift. Burger King, it turned out, would become part of a Canadian parent company, potentially resulting in significant savings on what it pays in U.S. taxes -- a maneuver known as a corporate tax ""inversion."" Politicians, and ordinary Americans, cried foul. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, urged customers to bring their fast-food cravings to two companies that have long operated from Ohio -- Wendy’s and White Castle. ""Burger King has always said ‘Have it Your Way,’ "" Brown said in a statement. ""Well, my way is to support two Ohio companies that haven’t abandoned their country or customers."" Meanwhile, hundreds of commenters took to Facebook to protest the move. ""If Burger King goes ahead with the ugly, greedy, anti-American tax-avoidance ploy of this inversion, I will NEVER AGAIN set foot inside any of your restaurants,"" said one. A reader asked us to check the accuracy of Burger King’s own Facebook message about the transaction. Here’s what the company posted: ""We hear you. We’re not moving, we’re just growing and finding ways to serve you better. ""As part of the announcement made today, both Burger King Corp. and Tim Hortons will continue to operate as independent brands. We’ll just be under common ownership. Our headquarters will remain in Miami where we were founded more than 60 years ago and business will continue as usual at our restaurants around the world. ""The decision to create a new global QSR leader with Tim Hortons is not tax-driven – it’s about global growth for both brands. BKC will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes. ""We’re proud of the heritage of Burger King and will maintain our long-standing commitment to our employees, franchisees and the local communities we serve. ""The WHOPPER isn’t going anywhere."" We decided to check the company’s claim that after merging with Tim Hortons of Canada, Burger King is ""not moving. … Our headquarters will remain in Miami"" and ""(we) will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes."" (Burger King's public-relations firm did not return an inquiry.) To start, we turned to Burger King’s corporate press release announcing the deal. In it, Alex Behring, Burger King’s executive chairman, explains that the deal involves ""bringing together our two iconic companies under common ownership."" Oakville, Ontario, will ""remain global home of Tim Hortons,"" the release says, while Miami is ""to remain global home of Burger King."" That’s the justification for the Facebook post’s claim that Burger King is ""not moving"" and that its ""headquarters will remain in Miami."" But that leaves out a significant wrinkle. The release notes that both companies will, in turn, be owned by a newly created, and as-yet unnamed, parent company. ""The new global company will be based in Canada, the largest market of the combined company,"" the release says. And that’s a detail that will likely have an impact on how much the company pays in U.S. taxes. Burger King is planning to manage its operations -- everything from the distribution of burger buns to its marketing strategy -- from Miami. But the new parent company's legal location, known as its ""domicile,"" will be in Canada -- an important point for tax purposes. When it was just an American company, Burger King paid U.S. taxes on its entire worldwide income -- a policy that few of the United States’ industrialized rivals have. Under U.S. tax law, the pre-merger Burger King would have been taxed when it brought home (or ""repatriated"") its foreign profits. It would have gotten a credit for the foreign taxes it paid and faced a U.S. tax liability on the amount above that. The biggest tax effect for the post-merger Burger King is that it will pay U.S. taxes only on the profit it earns in the United States. (The company will continue to be taxed on those profits in the countries in which they’re earned.) A related impact: Burger King’s new corporate structure may make it easier for the company to shuffle its earnings around in order to minimize tax liability. For instance, a company in Burger King’s situation can have ""the foreign part of the firm lend money to the U.S. part,"" Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said. ""The interest paid by the U.S. part is deductible against its U.S. income and thus cuts its U.S. taxes owed. The interest is taxable to the foreign part of the firm, but presumably at a lower rate, thus saving taxes on net."" Meanwhile, if the same merger had been made -- but the company instead chose to make its domicile in Miami -- the profits from Tim Hortons would have been subject to U.S. taxes once they were repatriated. Since Tim Hortons is of similar size to Burger King, this would not be a trivial amount. Given that they had a choice of locating the new parent company in either Canada or the United States, it’s easy to see why Burger King took the approach it did. ""When they say ‘(we) will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes,’ they are correct for the most part,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation. ""Every penny they earn here will be taxed. The only tax that they would no longer legally be required to pay is the additional U.S. tax on income they earn overseas."" It’s also worth noting that, unlike some maneuvers that were done almost exclusively to cut a company’s corporate tax bill, there’s a genuine business-strategic reason for the Burger King-Tim Hortons merger -- international expansion and an opening for Burger King into the breakfast market. And it’s not as if Burger King is moving its domicile to a Caribbean island with minuscule tax rates. The combination of national and provincial rate for corporate taxation in Ontario is 26.5 percent. Still, however logical the deal may be in business terms, the company’s Facebook post leaves a lot out of the picture. The Facebook post, while technically accurate, ""is misleading,"" said Edward Kleinbard, a University of Southern California professor in law and business and a former chief of staff of Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. ""The U.S. operating company will pay U.S. tax, but the existence of a new foreign holding company opens up a range of future tax avoidance possibilities."" Our ruling On its Facebook page, Burger King said that after merging with Tim Hortons of Canada, the company is ""not moving. … Our headquarters will remain in Miami"" and ""(we) will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes."" The part about not moving is technically accurate, but it leaves out that the company’s domicile will move from the United States to Canada -- a shift with potentially significant impacts on its tax liability. As for the part about continuing to pay its taxes, we’d fully expect the company to pay what it owes under the law. But that ignores that the company should be able to legally avoid significant tax payments it would have made had the company not merged. There may be sound financial reasons for Burger King’s incorporation decision, but the tone and message of the Facebook post is distinctly at odds with reality. The claim is partially accurate, but it takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/29/burger-king/burger-king-says-its-not-moving-and-will-continue-/

Unsupported claim: 1 in 4 apprehended border crossers have criminal convictions
","Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, backing Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to direct National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border, expressed concern about stopping criminals from entering the country. As quoted in a July 21, 2014, news story on Breitbart.com, Dewhurst said there is a huge ""criminal element"" at the border that includes significant gang activity. ""We've seen estimates that at least a quarter of those apprehended have criminal records,"" Dewhurst said. A reader asked us about that 25 percent statement. We rode an explanatory roller coaster before finding there is no research bearing out this claim. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Andrew Barlow pointed out a former Border Patrol official, Ronald Coburn, saying in a Fox News interview July 19, 2014: ""One in ten of every adult male crossers in this day and age more than likely already has a violent criminal record here in the United States, has been removed and is returning. Another one in ten, making it one in five, is bringing with him or her their violent criminal tendencies and records from their own countries of which we don't know yet,"" according to video posted by Breitbart.com. At least in the video snippet placed online, Coburn didn’t declare a source for his figures. In his email, Barlow further noted reports covering the federal fiscal year through September 2013. That year, the U.S. Border Patrol said, its officers apprehended 420,789 individuals. The same year, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE ""removed 106,695 criminals apprehended at the border while attempting to unlawfully enter the U.S."" Contrast those numbers, Barlow said, and it looks like 25 percent of apprehended individuals had criminal convictions. Following Barlow’s lead, we devised a slightly different calculation by focusing on the 414,397 individuals reportedly apprehended by the Border Patrol in the U.S.-Mexico border region. That contrast suggests 26 percent of the apprehended individuals already had a criminal conviction. Also, we noticed the ICE report directly presented an analysis of individuals with prior convictions. ""In FY 2013, ICE removed 235,093 recent border crossers,"" the report said. ""Many of those apprehended along the border had a prior criminal or civil immigration violation in the United States. Of those recent border crossers removed, 106,695 had a criminal conviction."" This seemed to signal 45 percent of recent border crossers removed by ICE that year already had a criminal conviction. So, Dewhurst’s statement seemed to hold up. Federal cautionary note That was before we heard back from ICE and the Border Patrol. Dallas-based ICE spokesman Carl Rusnok responded to our email seeking comment on these percentages by saying it’s ""inappropriate to compare Border Patrol apprehension statistics and ICE deportation statistics to come up with an accurate statistic on criminal aliens apprehended."" We asked why and didn’t hear back. But separately, Nestor Rodriguez, a University of Texas sociologist expert on immigration, said a weakness in using the percentages of individuals with criminal convictions deported by ICE to analyze the backgrounds of people caught near the border is that ICE may be deporting immigrants apprehended in previous years. Rodriguez said, too, that ICE in recent years has concentrated on removing individuals convicted of crimes, so it’s understandable many deportees would have U.S. convictions. Doug Mosier, an El Paso-based Border Patrol spokesman, struck a similar cautionary note about drawing conclusions about the criminal histories of people detained at the border from the backgrounds of people deported by ICE. By email, Mosier said: ""It is almost impossible to quantify ICE vs USBP numbers being that there are so many processes that can take place when a subject is apprehended at the border. Secondly, it is rare for ICE to apprehend people at the border; that mainly occurs in the interior."" Mosier added: ""What ICE removes will not fully represent illegal immigrants that USBP might process and repatriate on its own (in the case of Mexico, for example). Even though ICE deports them, it doesn’t mean that Border Patrol necessarily caught them; and just because they were deported/removed that year, does not mean that they entered that year. (Many of those persons that ICE removes are subjects that have either completed sentences in prisons or have exhausted their immigration benefits/hearings/processes, which can take some time)."" Less than 1 in 5 individuals apprehended near border have U.S. criminal/immigration violations Asked if the government has a sense of the U.S. criminal records of people the Border Patrol catches near the border, Mosier provided figures indicating that in both fiscal 2013 and the first nine months of fiscal 2014, less than 5 percent of immigrants captured by its agents near the southern border had a prior U.S. immigration or criminal conviction. Individuals Apprehended With Prior U.S. Criminal Convictions U.S. Border Patrol, Southwest Sector Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2014 (October 2013 through June 2014) Time Period Total Individuals Apprehended Apprehended Individuals With Prior U.S. Criminal/Immigration Conviction Percentage of Apprehended Individuals With Prior Conviction Fiscal 2013 414,397 15,466 3.7 % October 2013 through June 2014 422,146 18,422 4.4 %   Source: Email and telephone interview, Doug Mosier, spokesman, U.S. Border Patrol, El Paso, Aug. 13, 2014 We shared this information with Dewhurst's office. Barlow replied by email we’d misinterpreted what Dewhurst originally said in that the Texan was referring both to ""re-crossers"" convicted in U.S. courts and to individuals ""whose past criminal activity occurred in their country of origin or in the U.S. prior to their deportation-for-cause instead of a trial."" Dewhurst ultimately offered no data on the share of people apprehended at the border who had criminal convictions abroad--and that information might not be available. By email, Mosier of the Border Patrol told us that while every apprehended undocumented immigrant is screened for his or her immigration and U.S. criminal histories, home-country convictions and a person’s ""international criminal history"" isn’t usually available from federal data systems. Our ruling Dewhurst said at ""least a quarter of those apprehended"" at the border ""have criminal records."" Dewhurst’s described basis for this statement was a methodologically unsound mash-up fueled by the U.S. criminal histories of deported immigrants. In reality, less than 5 percent of people apprehended by the Border Patrol near the U.S.-Mexico border from October 2012 through June 2014 had a U.S. criminal conviction or immigration violation.

"['Taxes', 'PunditFact', 'Chris Matthews']","
Does the 'Wall Street Journal' really oppose the Burger King tax move?
","Forget what the fast food combo of Burger King and Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons might mean for the North American diet, consider the hit on American tax collections. Certainly that’s what stuck in the craw of Chris Matthews, host of Hardball on MSNBC. When the dust settles, the new company will be Canadian, a move that would change Burger King’s American tax status. On his show Aug. 27, as Matthews turned to his guests, it was crystal clear what he thought of this deal. ""Your thoughts now on this stinking idea to sneak out of the United States, sell all the hamburgers you can here, and skip your responsibilities to the American people,"" Matthews asked. Matthews said this was all a ""tax avoidance tactic."" And he told his guest his antipathy for it was shared by a most unexpected party, the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. ""The lead editorial today surprisingly attacked this tax scheme,"" Matthews said. That would be interesting if it were accurate. But it isn’t. The newspaper’s target was the American tax code. It said the Burger King deal provides ""a valuable public education on the need to reform America's noncompetitive tax system."" It praised Canada for lowering corporate taxes, and in case anyone missed the point, the editorial wrapped up with the word ""dumb."" ""That word also applies to America's corporate tax code, the reigning world champion in punishing investment and discouraging job creation,"" the editorial said. We wonder if the editorial’s headline sent Matthews down the wrong path. It chided President Barack Obama for losing his ""business front man,"" Warren Buffett, who put $3 billion into the acquisition. The Wall Street Journal referred to Buffett helping ""corporate deserters,"" but the goal was to further tweak the president. That is Obama’s term for companies that do what Burger King has done. We reached out to Matthews and his producers and did not hear back. Edward Kleinbard, professor of law at the University of Southern California and former chief of staff for Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, said contrary to attacking the deal, the Journal was saying, ""Whaddaya expect, when you put such high tax rates on earnest US companies?"" What made Matthews mad goes by the name of a tax inversion. This is when an American firm buys a foreign company and then says it is based in that other country. The American company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign one. While the U.S. operation pays taxes on its profits in America, overseas profits are subject to the tax rates in the new home base. As for where the Wall Street Journal stands on inversions, Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida, said the paper’s view is clear. The Journal ""is not attacking inversions,"" McGill said. ""They are pointing out that inversions, in fact, may be a reasonable, practical answer to solving the ongoing inability of the United States to rationalize its business tax system to catch up with the rest of the world."" Several advantages Inversions happen because, at least on paper, the U.S. corporate tax rate is higher than in Canada and Europe. The actual rates companies pay will vary, but nominally, the combined federal and provincial tax rate in Canada is about 27 percent, while in the United States, the federal rate alone is 35 percent. For multinational firms based in America, this means that if they brought their overseas profits home, they would see a higher tax bill. McGill said an inversion makes it easier for the new foreign company to move that money around. McGill added that it also becomes easier for the new overseas company to charge royalties and licensing fees to what is now considered an American subsidiary. ""This will reduce U.S. income while increasing the foreign corporation’s income. But that foreign corporation will likely be in a low-tax jurisdiction,"" McGill said. Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, said inversion offers another way to reduce the American tax bill. ""The advantages from a tax perspective are the ability to load the U.S. company with debt that generates interest deductions that reduce its tax on its U.S. operations,"" Avi-Yonah said. We should note that while the nominal U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent, companies with foreign operations rarely pay that much today. The Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, found that in 2010, profitable companies paid about 13 percent in federal taxes. Even without inversions, Kleinbard at the University of Southern California, wrote in a recent article that the fearsome U.S. tax rate is not what it purports to be. There are simply too many ways that multinational American firms can trim their tax bills. ""Effective marginal tax rates and overall effective tax rates reach the level of the U.S. headline rate only when firms studiously ignore the feast of tax planning opportunities laid out before them on the groaning board of corporate tax expenditures,"" Kleinbard wrote.
