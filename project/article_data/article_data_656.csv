Charlie Crist led Florida into economic recovery with stimulus, Obama says
","Former Gov. Charlie Crist once faced withering criticism for hugging President Barack Obama, but now Obama is returning the favor by embracing Crist’s congressional campaign. Obama endorsed Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, for a U.S. House seat in a June 20, 2016, statement. He said Crist ""has always put people above politics,"" and proved it during his single gubernatorial term between January 2007 and January 2011 — right as the Great Recession gripped the state following the housing market’s crash. ""As governor, in the face of partisan attacks, he (Charlie Crist) had the courage to save jobs and lead his state into economic recovery,"" Obama said. By ""courage,"" Obama means Crist, as a GOP governor, had the chutzpah to accept federal stimulus money from a Democratic president against the wishes of many Florida Republicans. Is it fair to credit Crist with saving jobs and helping Florida recover? The data during Crist’s term is mixed, experts say, but the state did recover and accepting the stimulus certainly helped. A stimulating review Remember that the recession officially began at the end of 2007, during Crist’s first year in office. The declining tax revenues and spiraling unemployment left the state facing massive budget shortfalls that were sure to result in cuts to state employees, including educators and law enforcement. Obama, meanwhile, had pushed Congress to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Washington’s $787 billion stimulus package. Vehemently opposed to anything Obama-related, Florida Republicans turned up their noses at the idea. But Crist committed a cardinal GOP sin by advocating for the stimulus, calling it a ""pragmatic, commonsense opportunity to move forward."" He lobbied the Florida congressional delegation to support the stimulus and made heart-eyes at Obama over the legislation. Then came that infamous hug at a Fort Myers rally with Obama on Feb. 10, 2009, the same day the Senate passed its version of the bill. Obama signed the stimulus into law a week later. Republicans weren’t keen to forgive Crist for pushing Obama’s stimulus package. ""I don't know that my governor understands all the details in this package — that there will be nothing here to help with Florida's housing economy,"" U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez said in February 2009. (Martinez had announced in 2008 he wouldn’t seek re-election, which we’ll get to in a second.) Broward County Republican state committeeman Ed Kennedy said Crist was ""cooking his own goose."" The state then got some $3 billion to shore up road construction, Medicaid, job training and more, and used more stimulus money to plug a $5 billion hole in the 2009-10 fiscal year budget. There also was a lot of borrowing from state trust funds and creative new taxes and levies, as well as a pay freeze for state workers. Before signing the stimulus-laden budget, Crist declared in May 2009 he would run for U.S. Senate as a Republican to replace Martinez. Although Crist was the initial favorite for the job, his stimulus push continued to haunt him. Republican groups wanted to censure Crist and the conservative Club for Growth bashed him in an online ad, saying he should spend more time fixing the economy, not ""passing more debt."" The state again relied on stimulus money for the 2010-11 budget, but the issue proved to be a liability for Crist in his U.S. Senate campaign. Crist eventually even waffled a bit on his own support for the spending package. Facing pressure from Republicans, including Rubio, Crist announced in in April 2010 that he would continue the race as an independent in a three-way race with Rubio and Democratic challenger Kendrick Meek. Rubio continued to attack Crist over the stimulus, deriding the package by saying on Fox News, ""If it's bad for America, it can't possibly be good for your state."" He also attacked Crist in debates, saying in one that, ""If you like Obamacare, if you like the stimulus plan, you can vote for Charlie Crist or Kendrick Meek."" Rubio won the seat with almost 49 percent of the vote. Meek won 20 percent, and Crist garnered 29.7 percent. So did the stimulus help? Experts we’ve spoken to all say one thing is clear: Florida’s economy would have been worse without it. ""It is true that federal stimulus money helped reduce the recession’s magnitude and duration,"" Moody’s senior economist Chris Lafakis told us. ""Florida’s economy bottomed out in terms of jobs in December 2009, when Crist was still in office."" His fellow Moody’s economist Kwame Donaldson added that it was ""undeniable"" the stimulus saved jobs in Florida, in part by keeping the state’s GDP from a continued decline in 2010. The full scope of the jobs picture is fuzzy at best. A lot of figures have been bandied about, but one that is usually accepted is that stimulus money prevented the loss of close to 20,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the education system, which relied heavily on the stimulus for two years. That’s not all educators, mind you, and even some in the school system who had been laid off were rehired as the state recovered. Some 14,000 other full-time equivalent state jobs were shielded in part by the stimulus, too. There is at least some data to suggest Florida was already limping back to a recovery by the time Crist left office. While Florida’s unemployment rate had ballooned to 11.4 percent by January 2010, a year later it had dropped to 10.9 percent, and kept falling. As of April 2016, the rate is 4.8 percent. Under Crist, the state lost more than 800,000 jobs, although you can’t blame that squarely on Crist’s policies given the larger forces of the country’s recession and housing crisis. But it was still a fact Gov. Rick Scott was happy to bring up when Crist attempted a return to the governor’s office as a Democrat in 2014. By and large, indicators show the state’s economy had stopped sliding, thanks in part to the stimulus money Crist had sought. But it’s not as if he rode a white horse into a recovery — Scott has enjoyed the big gains since 2011, as Florida joined the rest of the country climbing out of the recession. We do have to provide our usual disclaimers when dealing with whether an official is responsible for something. Economists and analysts have told PolitiFact Florida countless times now that there are many caveats to looking at economic indicators as a measure of an elected figure. Furthermore, any single governor’s policies are still subject to forces out of their control, such as, say, a global financial meltdown. Experts routinely contend it’s difficult to look at events in a vacuum, or to give credit for good outcomes while ignoring bad ones. Our ruling Obama said, ""As governor, in the face of partisan attacks, he (Charlie Crist) had the courage to save jobs and lead his state into economic recovery."" Crist was a vocal advocate for the federal stimulus, and it cost him politically as his fellow Republicans attacked him for it. The state ended up using billions to plug holes in the budget, and economists we’ve consulted agree that funding prevented Florida’s dismal economic picture from getting even worse. It’s a bit more difficult to entirely credit Crist with leading the state into a recovery, because most of the gains came after he left office, as the entire country emerged from the recession. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jun/23/barack-obama/charlie-crist-led-florida-economic-recovery-stimul/

Websites say Hillary Clinton's State Department blocked investigation into Orlando shooter's mosque
","The deadly nightclub attack in Orlando, Fla., has given rise to dozens of theories and explanations as to what happened and how it could have been stopped. One angle gaining traction in social media is that Hillary Clinton’s State Department enabled the attacker, U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, by blocking an investigation into a Florida mosque Mateen attended. Mateen killed 49 people and injured more than 50 in an Orlando nightclub June 12. The conspiracy-minded website InfoWars posted an article with the headline, ""Hillary’s State Dept. Blocked Investigation into Orlando Killer’s Mosque"" on Monday, June 13. Other websites, such as The Horn News, teased a story as ""Hillary’s shocking link to Orlando massacre,"" while Conservative County said Clinton’s link to the Orlando shooter ""has been exposed."" Collectively, they have been shared at least thousands of times. Is there any truth to these claims? Not according to experts. The claim The InfoWars article centers on the Fort Pierce Islamic Center that Mateen attended. The article claims the mosque under investigation by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in 2011, but that  the investigation was shut down ""under pressure from the Clinton-ran State Dept. and DHS’s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office out of fear of offending Muslims."" The InfoWars story seems to be taken directly from another right-wing website World Net Daily. But that article paints a different picture of the investigation. Both articles are based on the account of Philip Haney, a former Homeland Security agent who says he was assigned to a unit that investigated individuals with potential links to terrorism. He wrote a book published in 2016 called See Something Say Nothing: A Homeland Security Officers Exposes the Government's Submission to Jihad. Haney described investigating an Islamic movement known as the Tablighi Jamaat (misspelled in the InfoWars article). That movement was connected to the Institute of Islamic Education, which is connected to the Darul Uloom Chicago madrassa, which has links to the Sharia Board of America. Haney said he found the Sharia Board of America also had links to the Fort Pierce Islamic Center. In other words, the 2011 investigation Haney described didn’t look directly into Mateen’s mosque, like the InfoWars headline makes it seem. This isn’t the first time Haney has made a connection like this. After the San Bernardino shootings, Haney made the same claim when speaking to Megyn Kelly on Fox News and in a column he wrote in The Hill in February. ""The two San Bernardino jihadists, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, may have benefited from the administration’s closure of an investigation I initiated on numerous groups infiltrating radicalized individuals into this country,"" Haney wrote in an article on The Hill. We tried to reach Haney through his phone and also reached out to his book’s publishing company. He could not be reached in either attempt. The truth of the matter So that’s the story, and it relies almost entirely on one person’s account. One of the first holes in the InfoWars article is the misleading headline. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an adjunct assistant professor in Georgetown University's security studies program, said the headline is wrong and noted InfoWars misinterpreted the information that was taken from World Net Daily. ""It’s obviously wrong,"" Gartenstein-Ross said of the InfoWars headline. ""Although, if (InfoWars) changed some words in the headline, it would match their source (World Net Daily). Then there’s a further question if it’s accurate or not."" He said that the State Department could not block a case, but it’s possible it asserted pressure. Other experts we reached out to agreed that the InfoWars article doesn’t add up, or at least not in the specifics Haney mentions. The FBI has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism investigations, not Homeland Security, for which Haney worked, said Timothy Edgar, a senior fellow in international and public affairs at the Watson Institute. While Homeland Security does have a ""relatively small"" intelligence organization known as the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Edgar said, the office has no jurisdiction to collect information or investigate cases. Point being, Haney likely wouldn’t be in a position at Homeland Security to investigate a terrorism case in the first place. Perhaps the bigger problem with the claim made in the article is the way it characterizes the State Department’s role in investigations. First, the FBI doesn’t investigate entire communities like a mosque, Edgar said. It investigates specific people suspected of terrorist activity. More importantly, the State Department ""has no authority or involvement in decisions by the FBI to conduct or close investigations,"" Edgar said. ""It is simply not credible to describe a mosque as being under ‘FBI and DHS’ investigation, or that this activity was halted by the State Department or by the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties,"" Edgar said. The State Department’s focus is on operations overseas, said Martin Reardon, who is the senior vice president of the Soufan Group and a 21-year veteran of the FBI. The secretary of state would have no say in domestic FBI cases, or even have an interest in activities inside the United States. Furthermore, FBI agents have to go through a number of channels before a case is closed. It’s not just shut down. And even then, agents are sometimes told to do more work to assure the investigation was done properly, Reardon said. Our ruling Articles claimed that Clinton as secretary of state enabled radical Islamists by shutting down an investigation of Mateen’s Florida mosque. The claim relies heavily on one account of a retired Department of Homeland Security agent that has not been corroborated by any additional source. Experts we talked to say the claims of the investigation and the purported link to Clinton and the State Department is unlikely. The FBI, not Haney’s Homeland Security department, would handle a terrorism investigation. The State Department, meanwhile, would play little to no role in whether a case is opened, closed or anything else. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2016/jun/23/blog-posting/websites-say-hillary-clintons-state-department-blo/

Trump wrong that Clinton's refugee plan would cost more than rebuilding all inner cities
","A day after Hillary Clinton gave her list of Donald Trump’s many flaws on the economy, Trump returned the favor. In a speech from New York, he called her a ""world-class liar"" who has ""spent her entire life making money for special interests."" Trump delivered a broadside on Clinton’s immigration policies — to him, they represent ""mass amnesty"" and ""open borders"" — and blended those faults with her plans for refugees. ""Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration,"" Trump said. ""For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America."" We asked the Trump campaign where he got those spending numbers and did not hear back. But as you’ll see, whatever number Clinton could conceivably spend resettling refugees come nowhere near what it would cost to rebuild America’s urban centers. The cost of refugees The only numbers we could find for Clinton’s budget plans were $15 million for immigrant integration services (from her campaign website), and $582 million to resettle 70,000 refugees. The second figure comes from an analysis of federal refugee spending by the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. We used that as one starting point. President Barack Obama seeks to increase the number of refugees accepted from around the world to 100,000. That includes 10,000 Syrian refugees. Clinton has said she wants to take in 65,000 Syrians. If we add her higher number to Obama’s, and we assume she wouldn’t trim his plan, we can estimate a total number of refugees of 155,000. Scaling up the dollar amounts, we can roughly estimate a total cost for her plan of about $1.3 billion. That is about half a percent of the ""hundreds of billions"" that Trump claimed. We also looked at the Obama administration’s FY 2017 budget request for refugee and entrant assistance. That is a bit under $2.2 billion for 100,000 refugees. When you add in the additional costs for more resettled Syrian refugees, you might get a budget in the neighborhood of $3 billion to $4 billion. The cost of rebuilding inner cities Trump used a term that generally refers to low-income urban neighborhoods. What he meant by rebuilding them is unclear. It could include rebuilding substandard housing, fixing aging water systems, investing in schools and job training, creating an enticing business environment, or any number of aspects of life where low-income communities are lacking. Solomon Greene, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, an academic center in Washington, told us he knows of no comprehensive study that added up the rehabilitation needs of every American city. He did, however, note that alone there is a $26 billion backlog to repair the nation’s public housing. ""It’s a very conservative estimate,"" Greene said. ""It only includes public housing, and that’s a small share of the low-income housing stock."" Not all public housing is in urban centers, but Greene, a housing specialist, told us that the great majority of it is. New York City alone could use billions of dollars in improvements. The Center for an Urban Future, a research and policy group supported by funders ranging from MetLife to the Child Welfare Fund, estimated that fixing the Big Apple’s aging infrastructure would cost about $47 billion over five years. Researchers at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, an urban planning research center in Cambridge, Mass., found a number of estimates for different urban needs. The Federal Transit Administration estimated in 2013 that it will cost $85.9 billion to bring the nation’s transit systems to a state of good repair. The Council on Great City Schools said facility needs for schools in the 50 largest cities will cost $85 billion. The institute’s director George McCarthy estimated that it would cost $975 million just to demolish abandoned structures in Detroit. We could go further, but the numbers are clear. Barely scratching the surface of the needs of America’s cities, we find a price tag of over $225 billion. Even if Clinton doubled the Obama administration’s funding for refugees, the money would barely make a dent. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton wants to spend hundreds of billions on refugees and for that money, ""we could rebuild every inner city in America."" Trump’s campaign provided no supporting numbers. Clinton has not said how much she would spend on refugees, but the Obama administration request for FY 2017 is about $2.2 billion. That figure could increase for Clinton, as she has said she wants to take in more Syrian refugees. If it doubles or even triples, it is nowhere near ""hundreds of billions."" It is also a scant fraction of the price tag to rebuild America’s inner cities. There is no comprehensive tally of what it would take to deal with substandard housing and infrastructure, but we quickly found a backlog of about $225 billion in projects. Trump’s numbers are off by a huge margin.

Donald Trump wrongly claims there are many more part-time jobs because of health care law
","Criticizing the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, remains a top talking point for Republicans. Donald Trump railed against the law at a June 18 rally in Phoenix, saying he would ""terminate"" the law completely. ""Because of Obamacare, you have so many part-time jobs,"" Trump said. ""Companies are taking people that have been with them 20 years and more, 'I'm sorry, I love you, you're great, I have to make you part-time...' They want to get away from those horrendous Obamacare rules and regulations."" This is far from the first time PolitiFact has heard about the Affordable Care Act creating a glut of part-time jobs: In 2013, PolitiFact rated a claim False that ""as a result of Obamacare, we are becoming something of a part-time employment country."" That fact-check concluded that there is anectdotal evidence that some companies are or will reduce the hours of some employees. But those individual instances fail to make a case of moving to a ""part-time employment country."" In January 2015, Carl's Jr. CEO Andy Puzder said the Affordable Care Act has caused millions of full-time jobs to ""become part-time."" Hundreds of thousands of workers may have seen their hours cut, but millions couldn’t be substantiated. We rated it Half True. And in January 2016, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called the health care law the nation's ""biggest job-killer,"" forcing millions into part-time work. Government data showed no evidence of that. We rated it Pants on Fire! In this case, we wondered whether Trump’s version of this claim holds any merit.  What the law requires While Trump did not respond to our request for comment, claims like these are usually rooted in the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that certain employers offer their employees health care or pay a penalty.   According to the law, businesses with at least 50 employees are required to offer health care insurance to people who work 30 or more hours per week. Not doing so results in a financial penalty. Critics of the law say businesses may artificially keep employees under the 30-hour threshold so they can avoid the costs associated with providing them health care. Little to no evidence Is that happening? Anecdotally, there are examples critics of the law can point to. Some universities, for instance, have capped the number of hours a student can work on a university job below the Obamacare threshold. The trouble with this evidence, however, is it's unclear how many students or employees are affected. Or in the case of students, if they ever really were considered full time. In the macro, there is little evidence of a large-scale migration to part-time work. In April 2010, the first full month under the Affordable Care Act, there were almost 9.2 million part-time workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS defines part-time as working 34 hours or less. Through May 2016, there are actually far fewer part-time workers, not more. According to BLS, there were 6.4 million part-time workers in May -- an almost 30 percent drop compared to April 2010. There also is still a decrease in part-time workers comparing the current figure to when the employer mandates under the health care law took effect, in January 2015 and January 2016, respectively. Now BLS data isn't perfect for answering this question. The BLS threshold in hours per week for ""full-time"" employment is different than it is for the Affordable Care Act. In addition, BLS counts someone who works two 20-hour-a-week part time jobs as one full-time worker. Both of these factors complicate any calculations using BLS data. But the data is largely corroborated by scientific research. An August 2015 study from the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, for instance, concluded that there is no increase in part-time work because of the law. ""There is little evidence that the ACA has caused the shift across hours categories, or led to an increase in part-time employment,"" the study concluded. ""However, the ACA could cause a shift towards part-time work in the future as the mandate takes effect. "" ""The truth is, it doesn’t show up in the data yet,"" said co-author and American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Aparna Mathur. A January 2016 study published in Health Affairs, ""Little Change Seen In Part-Time Employment As A Result Of The Affordable Care Act,""reached the same basic conclusion with the exception of a possible rise for people with little education and those between 60-64 years old. And whether it will ever show up in the data is debatable, according to Bowen Garrett, an economist at the Urban Institute, a Washington D.C. economic research non-profit. He argues in a February 2016 blog post that workers could be ""equally influenced"" by the Great Recession.   ""We’ve been in a labor market recovery. We’re not becoming a nation of part-time workers,"" Garrett said. Vanderbilt University public policy professor Carolyn Heinrich co-authored a study published in June 2016 looking at the Affordable Care Act’s effect on part-time workers who want to work full-time in the retail and food service sectors.   The study uses Hawaii as a control group, noting that the state has required employers to provide health insurance to employees who work more than 20 hours per week since 1974. Based on the findings, the study estimates a 2 to 3 percent increase in part-time work associated with the Affordable Care Act. Trump’s ""suggestion that many people previously had full-time jobs and have now been pushed into part-time jobs is also greatly exaggerated,"" Heinrich said. ""The people who are working less since Obamacare were more likely to be working hours close to the 30-hour threshold (that defines full-time work under the ACA), or less than 40 hours per week."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Because of Obamacare, you have so many part-time jobs."" While some research suggests a small uptick in the number of part-time jobs as a result of the Affordable Care Act, Trump’s claim goes too far. Neither the data nor the experts (on the right and left) say Trump’s claim is accurate. We rate Trump’s claim False.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26f81290-72f4-4dea-ac40-ab595a476385",/factchecks/2016/jun/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-claims-there-are-more-part-ti/

With universal background checks on Nevada ballot, would state become stricter than California?
","Two major players in the debate over gun laws are bringing the fight to Nevada, where voters will decide in November on requiring universal background checks on the sale or transfer of firearms. Both the National Rifle Association and Everytown for Gun Safety are dumping millions of dollars into the state in the battle over Question 1. Veteran state Republican operative Robert Uithoven is leading efforts to defeat the measure, and recently criticized the initiative on a public-affairs television program and warned that passing the measure would make Nevada gun laws even more restrictive than its more liberal neighbor — California. ""If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California,"" he said in a June 6 interview on Nevada NewsMakers. The California/Nevada comparison is becoming a more popular talking point among opponents of the ballot measure, but would Question 1 actually make Nevada stricter than California on gun transfers? The answer isn’t so clear. What’s at stake? So what would Nevada’s proposed background check expansion actually mean for gun owners? If approved by voters, the initiative would create an escalating penalty (starting with a misdemeanor) for people without a license to sell firearms to sell or transfer guns without first going to a licensed dealer and having them conduct a background check. That would be a departure from current state law, where background checks are generally not required for gun sales or transfers between two private parties (lawmakers approved a change waiving fees for voluntary background checks in 2015). Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval vetoed a bill in 2013 that would have enacted a similar background check process on private gun sales and transfers, saying it would impose ""unreasonable burdens and harsh penalties"" on otherwise law-abiding gun owners. If approved, licensed firearm dealers would be required to conduct the background checks, which is done under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and is generally completed fairly quickly (though delays can last up to three days). There are some exceptions built in to the ballot question, including sales and transfers between family members and for antique guns. Temporary transfers without background checks would be allowed in some specific cases, like on certified shooting ranges, in areas where it’s legal to hunt or while in the presence of the gun owner. Debate over the ballot measure echoes the national debate over gun control. Supporters say the majority of background checks are completed quickly and the measure closes an existing loophole, while opponents lambast the measure for being overly vague and unduly burdensome on gun owners. Transfers and Exemptions Approval of Question 1 would turn private party gun sales and transfers in Nevada into a process that would more closely resemble California’s existing system, but there are some differences that would persist between the two states especially in the area of temporary gun transfers, or loans. Uithoven told PolitiFact that California generally allows people ""who are personally known to each other"" to infrequently loan firearms for up to 30 days as long as the recipient has a valid firearm safety certificate and the loan is for a ""lawful purpose."" California also has exemptions for transfers as gifts, on gun ranges, for use as props in the entertainment industry, loans to minors under certain requirements and for licensed hunters during hunting season(though California lawmakers are debating rolling back several of the exemptions including the 30-day infrequent loans). Because the Nevada ballot measure don’t allow for a ""temporary"" transfer, or loan, between friends unless the gun owner is in the physical presence of the person handling the gun or under a several clearly stated, well-defined situations (like on a shooting range or legal hunting area), Uithoven says the new law would be stricter than what California requires. The ballot measure does have a broader definition of ""immediate family member,"" as California only includes transfers between parents, children, and grandparents as exempt from transfer regulations. Question 1 broadens those family exemptions in Nevada and includes ""parents, children, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews."" So California is stricter on which family members fall under the inter-family gun transfers label, but as Uithoven points out, the state does have an easier process for ""infrequent"" firearms loans (less than six times per calendar year) to people who are ""personally known to each other,"" which could include friends or other family members. But those ""infrequent transfers"" still require firearm transferees to have completed the state’s Firearm Safety Certificate course, which is a $25 written test on firearm safety and general gun laws. That’s a regulatory hurdle that doesn’t exist in Nevada, with or without the ballot measure. As for any other non-familial transfers that don’t fall under exemptions, California is generally stricter than a post-Question 1 Nevada. So-called ""private party transfers"" in California require a proof-of-residency requirement, a safe handling demonstration requirement and a mandatory ten-day waiting period, whereas the Nevada proposal would only require passing a background check. Uithoven also says that the ballot measure allows licensed firearms dealers to ask for an undefined ""reasonable fee"" to conduct the background check, while California has a set dollar amount written into the state’s penal code. We also reached out to the pro-Question 1 Background Checks Initiative, who highlighted a handful of California regulations that Nevada would lack. California also has an ""assault weapons"" ban, which includes a ban on private sales or transfers of so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Nevada has no such ban. The state has several additional regulations on private party gun sales compared to the proposed Nevada changes, but not all of them directly relate to firearm transfer rules. California generally requires a 10-day waiting period for any gun sale or transfer, including private party sales and transfers (though it’s being challenged in court). Again, this regulation doesn’t apply to the exempted transfers. California also prohibits buyers from purchasing more than one handgun in a 30-day period, but that’s only for retail sales — private party transfers are exempt. Our ruling NRA Nevadans for Freedom campaign manager Robert Uithoven said passing Question 1 would lead to ""more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California."" Passing the ballot question would make Nevada look a lot more like California in terms of private party gun sales and transfers, with generally fewer regulations. Uithoven’s claim focuses specifically in on the process of firearm transfers. In some ways, Nevada’s law would be tougher, but in other ways it would not. Overall, California would have more regulations on firearm transfers if Question 1 passes but would be more lenient in exempting certain types of gun transfers. Uithoven’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/58d554fc-0594-4176-8f93-379390f58bf5",/factchecks/2016/jun/22/robert-uithoven/universal-background-checks-ballot-how-would-nevad/

GOP foe close saying Bennet votes 98% with Obama — but wrong calling him 'hardly bipartisan'
","At a recent debate, Colorado U.S. Senate candidate Ryan Frazier made a plea for party unity with his opponents. ""We as Republicans must unify, because the stakes are that important. And I believe any of us on this stage would be a heck of a lot better than Michael Bennet,"" said Frazier, a former Aurora city councilman, referring to Colorado’s incumbent Democratic senator. ""You see, Michael Bennet votes for President Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time. Hardly independent, hardly bipartisan,"" Frazier stressed.

Frazier is among five Republicans scrapping to win the June 28 primary and a shot at toppling Bennet in the general election. So let’s look deeper at Frazier’s claim that Bennet votes for Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time, and whether that makes him ""hardly independent, hardly bipartisan.""

The campaign cited a Jan. 12 online statement by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which cited the annual percentage of Bennet’s votes where he supported the president’s position from 2009 through 2014. The average for those years is 97.5 percent, which rounds up to 98 percent, the figure Frazier cited. The NRSC attributed the data to CQ Roll Call, a nonpartisan news service that tracks congressional data. But the NRSC statement misstated the percentage for Bennet’s 2014 votes with Obama as ""100 Percent Of The Time."" CQ’s Vote Watch database says Bennet voted with Obama 99.3 percent of the time in 2014. The NRSC also left out data for 2015, when Bennet backed the president’s positions 89.7 percent of the time, according to CQ. When we add the 2015 voting data, Bennet’s seven-year average of voting with the president is 96.57 percent — just a bit lower than Frazier’s claim of 98 percent. However, Bennet’s campaign spokesman Andrew Zucker said it’s easy to use the CQ figures to distort a lawmaker’s overall record in Congress. Zucker noted that Bennet has opposed Obama’s plans when they conflict with Colorado’s interest. He successfully fought the administration’s 2010 plan to slash funding for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in Fort Collins that is working to combat the Zika virus. He also pushed back against the administration’s proposal to cut funding for the Orion aerospace program in Colorado that supported 1,000 jobs in the state. Bennet has also voted against the president on major issues. He was one of nine Democrats to side with Republicans on a bill to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Obama vetoed that bill and Bennet voted for an unsuccessful effort to override the veto. Here’s some background to keep in mind when sifting through CQ’s presidential support statistics. First of all, they only deal with a fraction of votes cast by Bennet. CQ only counts those votes where the president takes a ""clear position"" on an issue. For example, according to CQ, Obama only staked out a position on 145 of the 366 votes the Senate took in 2014. And the vast majority of the presidential support votes in 2014 — 125, or 86 percent — involved a glut of presidential nominees for federal posts, because the Democrats controlled the Senate then and had lowered the threshold for approving most nominees from 60 votes to a simple majority, CQ reported. In fact, in every year but 2009 (40 percent), a majority of the votes Obama has supported were on his nominees.     Bennet called ‘party loyalist’ and ‘bipartisan problem solver’ While Frazier calls Bennet ""hardly independent, hardly bipartisan,"" there is evidence the senator works across the aisle. Last year, the Washington Post ranked him fifth among Democratic senators who ""vote against their party the most.""   The chart below shows how often Bennet has voted with Senate Democrats, compared to how the party majority voted, according to CQ. Bennet voted closest with the Democratic Party in 2014 -- he voted 98.8 percent to the party’s average of 98.6 percent -- but his support for the party’s position dropped down to 82.9 percent in 2015.  Over seven years, Bennet voted with the Democratic Party on average 91.29 percent of the time — a few points less than the average for all Democratic senators voting with the party (94.51 percent) during that period. A CQ profile of the senator said, ""Bennet has played dual roles, as a party loyalist and a bipartisan problem solver.""   As a Democratic loyalist, he’s fought to protect Medicare, saying, ""We can’t attempt to balance the nation’s budget on the backs of our seniors,"" CQ reported. Wearing his problem-solver hat, Bennet worked with Republican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah to win FDA support for ""breakthrough therapies"" legislation in 2012 that sped approval of new drug treatment for cystic fibrosis, lung cancer and leukemia. Bennet often joins groups seeking compromise Bennet has been a frequent member of bipartisan groups of lawmakers working to find compromise on major legislation, the CQ profile said. He was one of three Democratic senators to oppose the January 2013 ""fiscal cliff"" deal, which averted income tax increases on earnings under $400,000 but didn’t cut federal spending — a deal-breaker for Bennet. Bennet, a former Denver Public Schools superintendent, has earned praise from Republicans for reaching across the aisle, including for his work on the overhaul of the No Child Left Behind law. ""Michael understands that the Senate is a place where you have extended debate on important subjects and work across party lines until you come to a consensus — that’s how you get a result, and that’s how you govern a complex country,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate education committee, told the Denver Post in 2015. Our ruling Frazier said, ""Michael Bennet votes for President Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time. Frazier cited the frequency of Bennet voting with the president as proof he is ""hardly independent, hardly bipartisan.""   In this case, Bennet is close on the available numbers, but they don’t indicate a blind allegiance to Obama’s agenda, as Frazier argues. CQ data show Bennet voting for the president’s position on legislation an average of 96.57 percent over seven years. That’s just over 1 percentage point below Frazier’s figure. However, the CQ data distorts the senator’s voting record, because a majority of the time the president expresses his position is when a vote involves someone he’s nominated for a federal post. There is also independent support for the view that Bennet is a ""bipartisan"" lawmaker who works with and votes with Republicans more often than the Senate’s Democratic caucus as a whole. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Trump right that Clinton made up story about Bosnia sniper fire
","Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump wasted no time punching back the day after Hillary Clinton listed in detail why he could not be trusted to run the economy. Clinton ""is a world-class liar,"" Trump said in a June 22, 2016, speech in New York. ""Just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers."" On that Bosnia trip, Trump picked one of Clinton’s most prominent transgressions. When she made that claim, we rated it Pants on Fire in 2008. Here’s why. During an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996. ""I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base."" But that's not what happened, as demonstrated by CBS News video that shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. The Washington Post Fact Checker also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady. CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit, wrote of her memories of the trip: ""To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. "" Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. ""There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,"" she said. But she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she ""misspoke,"" correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, ""So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation."" On the campaign trail, Clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience. The Des Moines Register reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, ""We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there."" Interestingly, Clinton's memoir Living History depicts an arrival that, though dangerous, included neither actual sniper fire nor running. It matches the CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's later retelling: ""Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.' "" There's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. And there was a welcoming ceremony where a young girl gave her a poem. Our ruling Trump said Clinton claimed ""she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers."" In all key respects, Trump is correct. Clinton did claim that she landed in Bosnia under sniper fire and that there was no greeting ceremony. She later retracted the entire statement. The only flaw in Trump’s speech is he said Clinton was handed flowers. It was a poem, which seems like a trivial difference. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea63fd8e-0b2a-4426-9a73-fab000398202",/factchecks/2016/jun/22/donald-trump/trump-clinton-bosnia-sniper-story/

Trump still wrong on his claim that opposed Iraq War ahead of the invasion
","Presumptive Republican presidential Donald Trump keeps selling the myth that he was against Iraq War even before the war started. In a policy speech June 22, 2016, in New York, Trump tried to contrast himself with his likely fall opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. ""In short, Hillary Clinton’s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another,"" Trump said. ""It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place. ""Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started,"" Trump said. Trump is correct that Clinton supported the war in Iraq. But Trump is wrong to suggest he opposed the war before it started. We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003 amid the debate leading up to the Iraq War. We didn’t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began. Trump’s comments Most damning to Trump’s claim is a September 2002 interview in which Trump said he supported the Iraq invasion. Shock jock Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion. Trump responded, ""Yeah, I guess so."" This goes directly against Trump’s claims that he criticized the rush to war before the war began. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, ""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" Trump’s comment here suggests he was skeptical of the mission in Iraq, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But does this prove Trump prove was ""among the earliest to criticize the rush to war""? Hardly. A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that ""the war’s a mess,"" according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket."" Trump’s harshest criticism came more than a year into the war, in an August 2004 article in Esquire: ""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have. ""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!"" He told CNN’s Larry King in November 2004, ""I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out."" Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war in the first place, or that he was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war. Our ruling On the Iraq War, Trump said, ""I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started."" The record just doesn’t support this. We could only find one example of Trump commenting on the Iraq War before the invasion where he seemed apprehensive but not vehemently opposed to the operation. In another interview, Trump said he supported the invasion. This claim rates False.  ",/factchecks/2016/jun/22/donald-trump/trump-still-wrong-his-claim-opposed-iraq-war-ahead/

Marco Rubio flip-flops on running for Senate
","""In November of next year, I will either be the president of the United States or a private citizen again, because I have a sense of urgency.""  -- March Rubio, Oct. 20, 2015 ""I think that the point that really drove me to change my mind is that as we enter this kind of new chapter in our history here is, there’s another role the Senate plays that I think can be really important in the years to come."" -- Marco Rubio, June 22, 2016 U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio announced that he will seek re-election in Florida, ending weeks of speculation about his political future. Rubio told reporters that he faced a sense of duty to remain in office whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is elected president. Rubio’s decision is a complete reversal of what he said as he ran for president, which likely opens him up for criticism as he begins his late campaign. We traced Rubio’s statements about running for re-election, with a focus on statements since he announced for president in April 2015. We are putting his statements on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter which measures the extent to which a politician flips without making a judgment call about those changes. (You can read all of our fact-checks of Rubio on our Truth-O-Meter.) While campaigning, Rubio repeatedly said he was running for president and not for re-election. After he dropped out in March, he said he would not seek re-election. But in recent weeks some of his comments left wiggle room. Rubio’s statements while a presidential candidate Leading up to his April 13, 2015, president announcement, Rubio repeatedly said he wouldn’t seek another Senate term if he ran for president. He couldn’t be on the ballot in Florida for two federal offices at the same time, although technically there was time to do that if he ran for president and dropped out because the qualifying period for the Senate seat is June 2016. Rubio’s vow to not run cleared the path for a handful of other Republicans to jump into the race. Rubio said many times he had no intention for conducting a bid for Senate. Here are just a few. Feb. 20, 2015: Rubio told reporters at the Palm Beach International Airport: ""If I decide the best place for me to serve America is to run for president, that's what I'm going to do. And I'm not going to have an exit strategy premised on the idea that I'm going to pivot back to a Senate race. We have quality candidates in the state on the Republican side who could run and make great senators."" May 11, 2015: Rubio told ABC News, ""I believe that if you want to be president of the United States, you run for president. You don't run for president with some eject button in the cockpit that allows you to go on an exit ramp if it doesn't work out."" Oct 20, 2015: Rubio said on Fox News, ""In November of next year, I will either be the president of the United States or a private citizen again, because I have a sense of urgency."" March 11, 2016: In West Palm Beach, Rubio said, ""I'm running for president of the United States. I intend to see that process through to the end. I intend to be the nominee. If that doesn't work out, I've told everyone very clearly: January of next year I will either be the president of the United States or I will be a private citizen. And if I never hold elected office again, I'm comfortable with that."" March 14, 2016: A day before Florida’s primary he told the Miami Herald, ""I have no problem becoming a private citizen and moving on to other endeavors, to be successful at other things. I've not given much thought to it yet, but things outside of politics."" Rubio’s statements after losing primary Rubio lost the Florida primary March 15. He continued to say he wouldn’t run again but then began to slightly qualify his commitment against running. March 17, 2016: Rubio told reporters in Washington, ""I'll finish out my term in the Senate. We're going to work really hard here. We have some things we want to achieve. Then I'll be a private citizen in January."" May 16: Rubio tweeted, ""I have only said like 10000 times I will be a private citizen in January."" May 17: Rubio told a radio station that ""I think being a private citizen is a good thing."" However, he didn’t rule out running at some point in the future. May 26: Rubio told reporters it was ""unlikely"" he would seek re-election: ""I didn't think it was fair for me to run for president and freeze that seat in a competitive state. So, I made my decision. I don't have anything new to say from what I said in the past. ... I made that decision and I've lived by that decision. Nothing's changed."" But pressed further whether he might change his mind he replied, ""I don't think so. Look, I enjoy serving with my colleagues, I respect them very much; I'll always listen to what they have to say. But I don't think anything's going to change."" May 29: CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Rubio if he would run if his friend, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, didn’t. ""Maybe"" Rubio said. June 13: The day after the mass shooting at an Orlando gay club, radio show host Hugh Hewitt asked Rubio about whether he would run for re-election. ""I think when it visits your home state, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,"" Rubio said. He added: ""My family and I will be praying about all of this. And we'll see what I need to do next with my life with regard to how I can best serve."" June 15: Rubio had repeatedly said he was supporting Lopez-Cantera. After the Orlando shooting, Lopez-Cantera told Politico that on Sunday he encouraged Rubio to run. Rubio told reporters he would think about it over the weekend. ""Obviously I take very seriously everything that's going on, not just in Orlando but in our country. I enjoy my service here a lot. So I'll go home later this week and I'll have some time with my family and then if there’s been a chance in our status, I'll be sure to let everyone know."" June 22: Rubio told reporters that he decided to run. ""I think that the point that really drove me to change my mind is that as we enter this kind of new chapter in our history here is, there’s another role the Senate plays that I think can be really important in the years to come. And that’s the power given to it in the Constitution to act as a check and balance on the excess of the president. It’s even more important given the fact that control of the Senate could very well come down to what happens in the Florida race."" Our rating Rubio said multiple times in 2015 and 2016 that he would not seek another term in the Senate, even if he dropped out of the presidential race. After he dropped out of the race in March 2016, Rubio reiterated that he would not seek re-election and would be a private citizen in January. He showed signs of rethinking that position in recent weeks, particularly after the Orlando shooting. On June 22, Rubio announced he will seek a second term.

Is Bernie Sanders right about Russ Feingold's campaign also being 'powered by' small contributions?
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont loves to boast about his independence from super PACs and billionaires, saying his campaign relies on the support of small donors. Recently, the Democratic presidential hopeful extended his small donor claim to Russ Feingold. Sanders sent out a news release May 26, 2016 that said he would be raising money for Feingold, a former U.S. senator who is aiming to unseat Republican incumbent Ron Johnson in a rematch of their 2010 contest. Sanders also sent an email to his national fundraising list. ""We are going to have to elect candidates up and down the ballot who recognize that it is too late for establishment politics and economics,"" Sanders wrote. ""Candidates like my friend, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold."" Sanders continued: ""Russ led the fight with me to make the Affordable Care Act much stronger in 2009. He voted against the USA PATRIOT Act and the war in Iraq. He authored and passed landmark campaign finance reform legislation and his campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours."" That last accolade caught our eyes. Sanders’s record-breaking level of small-contribution support has been well noted. We wondered if small donors were also ""powering"" Feingold’s campaign. Sanders’ backup Typically, small donors are considered those who give $200 or less over an election cycle. Having a lot of small-dollar contributions can indicate strong grassroots support and an effective online fundraising effort. When asked to back up the statement, Sanders’ team sent us to a news release issued by Feingold’s campaign in April 2016. At that time, the release said, 30,000 Wisconsinites had contributed to Feingold’s campaign with money coming in from each of the state’s 72 counties. The release also claimed 96 percent of all contributions in the first quarter were $100 or less. The problem for fact-checkers -- it cannot be independently verified. PolitiFact National explored the issue when presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said ""our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support."" Her team provided similar information, saying more than 50 percent of the money raised by the campaign came from ""online grassroots donations,"" with 98 percent smaller than $250. Until an individual donor surpasses $200 in contributions, their funds are unitemized on campaign disclosure reports. So the number of donors who give less than $200 is unknown. Numbers reported to the Federal Elections Commission provided weak support for Clinton’s statement, PolitiFact National found. And small donors accounted for less than 20 percent of Clinton’s total donations, according to those figures. The claim was rated Mostly False. FEC numbers The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group, tracks money given to candidates from individuals and PACs, as well as those self-financing their campaigns and money contributed from other means. Sanders’ profile on the group’s web site reports that 99 percent of his campaign’s more than $200 million in funds has come from individual contributions (as opposed, for instance, to political action committees). Of that, 62 percent -- or more than $129 million -- was from contributions of $200 or less. The other part comes from large individual contributions of up to $2,700. So what about Sanders’ Wisconsin pal, Feingold? According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Feingold has raised more than $10 million in the race against Johnson. Like Sanders, an overwhelming amount of his funds, 93 percent, come from individual contributions. But, Feingold has received a larger share of donations from large donors than small ones. Feingold received 52 percent of his overall funds from people who gave more than $200. Another 41 percent came from small individual donors. He also received about $600,000 from PAC contributions. So, the majority of Sanders’ funding -- 62 percent -- comes from these small donors while 41 percent of Feingold’s funding came from small donors. The phrase ""powered by,"" of course, is open to some interpretation. We took a look at candidates in other competitive Senate races across the country this election cycle. Most candidates received less than 20 percent of all campaign funds from small donors. Some approached 30 percent -- still far below the proportion of funds Feingold has raised from small donors. So, while Feingold is not above 50 percent -- and does not match Sanders’ level -- we feel like the claim is generally on target. It doesn’t factor into this claim, but as a point of reference, Johnson has raised just less than $12 million. Individuals donated about 80 percent of that money. He has gotten a far greater share of his contributions from big spenders -- those donating between $200 and $2,700 this election cycle. Just 15 percent of his funds come people who donate less than $200, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Our rating Sanders said in a fundraising letter that Feingold’s ""campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours."" Both the presidential and congressional hopefuls have received the majority of their support from individual donors. While small donors have played a role in Feingold’s funding, they’re not as integral as Sanders’ small donors.

Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte voted against expanding gun background checks, twice
","In the wake of a mass shooting in Orlando, lawmakers in Washington have refocused their efforts on federal gun laws. But on Monday the U.S. Senate shot down a number of firearm bills, designed to expand or strengthen background checks and prevent sales to people on terror watchlists. And now the issue is becoming a central line of attack against Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is seeking re-election in one of the most competitive races this year. The New Hampshire Democratic Party took the first swing, followed by Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is running for Ayotte’s senate seat. ""Ayotte voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- meaning dangerous individuals, including suspected terrorists, can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks,"" Hassan’s campaign said in an email on Tuesday, June 21, 2016.   We decided to take a look at Ayotte’s votes and see if she voted against expanded background checks, as Hassan said. The U.S. Senate took four votes June 20 on a variety of firearm proposals, all of which failed to earn the necessary 60 votes to progress. Hassan’s campaign pointed us to an amendment sponsored by U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Current law requires background checks only for purchases from federally licensed gun dealers. Murphy’s proposal would have expanded the checks to include sales at gun shows, over the internet and those between friends and family members. Ayotte joined Republican colleagues on a mostly partisan vote to defeat the measure 44-56, well short of the 60 votes needed to advance. ""The Murphy legislation is very broad ... and I think that there are concerns about it,"" Ayotte said Monday, according to The Hill. ""I’ve previously said that I think it’s important to fix the current system."" Ayotte voted against a similar background check amendment in 2013, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and internet sales.   Back then, Ayotte instead supported an amendment by Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, which would have increased the mental health records given to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and provided money for prosecuting background check violations. But it did not expand background checks to cover firearms sales at gun shows or over the Internet. It failed 52-48. On Monday, Grassley introduced a similar amendment, and Ayotte supported it, again. Like the amendment from three years earlier, it would have increased money for the background check system and further defined what it means to be ""mentally competent"" to buy a firearm, but did not expand background checks to cover any new firearms sales, including gun shows and internet sales. It resulted in a familiar outcome as three years ago: It failed 53-47. For the most part, Democrats favored the Murphy amendment, while Republicans supported Grassley.   Ayotte backed the Grassley amendment because she said it improves on the current system. Ayotte’s campaign spokeswoman said Hassan’s claim is misleading. ""The Murphy amendment, which was opposed by one of the Senate’s top Democrats, is a broad expansion of a flawed system, and does not require law enforcement notification when an individual who was on the terrorist watchlist in the past five years attempts to buy a firearm,"" spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in a statement. Ayotte did vote for two competing proposals Monday that sought to block the sale of firearms to suspected terrorists. One, proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, would let the attorney general stop anyone on the federal terrorist watch lists from buying a gun, according to the Washington Post. Another, put forward by Republican Sen. John Cornyn, would let the government delay a sale to known or suspected terrorists for 72 hours while it investigated. Neither proposal passed, failing to win the needed 60 votes. Ayotte had previously voted against the Feinstein amendment, but voted Monday in support. Our ruling Maggie Hassan said Kelly Ayotte ""voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- (buyers) can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks."" In 2013, Ayotte voted against the bi-partisan Manchin-Toomey amendment that sought to expand checks for firearms purchased online and at gun shows. On June 20, Ayotte voted against a Democrat-sponsored amendment that similarly sought to expand background checks. Both times, Ayotte instead voted for a different amendment that would have strengthened the current system, but did not expand background checks to cover firearms sales at gun shows or over the Internet, two things cited by Hassan.   We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2016/jun/21/maggie-hassan/challenger-maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-a/

","Hillary Clinton mocked Donald Trump’s business failings in a major speech arguing that the presumptive Republican nominee would be disastrous for the economy. ""He’s written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11,"" Clinton quipped, adding. ""He bankrupted his companies not once, not twice, but four times."" We rated a similarly worded claim from Trump’s former primary rival Carly Fiorina Mostly True, because it’s not accurate to say Trump is solely to blame. (For the record, Trump doesn’t deny the charge and instead argues it was a smart business decision.) At the time, we found four bankruptcies, but since then, we’ve found two more for a total of six. So Clinton was right that Trump bankrupted companies four times, and she could have offered a higher count as well. Let’s go through them one by one. Bankruptcy No. 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991 Trump’s first bankruptcy may have hit the businessman, personally, the hardest, according to news reports. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J., which opened in 1990, primarily with junk bonds at a whopping 14 percent interest. A year later, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities. So Trump decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post. Bankruptcy No. 2: Trump Castle, 1992 Within a year of his first Chapter 11 filing, Trump found himself in bankruptcy court again for Trump Castle, which opened in 1985. It was his ""weakest gambling hall,"" according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, and ironically faced competition from Trump Taj Mahal. In March 1992, the Castle filed a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, and Trump gave up his 50 percent share in the casino for lower interest rates on $338 million worth of bonds. Bankruptcy No. 3: Trump Plaza and Casino, 1992 The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1984, declared bankruptcy at the same time as the Castle. A $210 million joint project of Trump’s and Harrah’s, the casino had racked up $250 million in debt by 1992, after a staggering 80 percent decline in cash flow. So Trump Plaza filed for prepackaged bankruptcy that spring as well. Bankruptcy No. 4: Plaza Hotel, 1992 Later that year, Trump filed bankruptcy on another Plaza, this one in New York. Trump purchased the Plaza Hotel in Midtown Manhattan for $390 million in 1988, but it accumulated more than $550 million in debt by 1992. In December 1992, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel’s CEO, but it was merely a gesture; he didn’t earn a salary and had no say in the hotel’s day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times. Bankruptcy No. 5: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004 Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth. Bankruptcy No. 6: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 Trump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts -- was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. It declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After debating with the company’s board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing. Whose fault is it anyways? Experts told us during the primary season Trump alone didn’t cause the bankruptcies. While six in 25 years is a lot, five were tied to a struggling gaming industry. Trump was acting, they said, as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, previously told us. He added that people typically wouldn’t personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. ""The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,"" Levitin said. Our ruling Clinton said, Trump has ""bankrupted his companies not once, not twice but four times."" Trump has actually filed Chapter 11 six times, four times within two years in the 1990s, once more in 2004 and once more in 2009. But experts told us Trump shouldn’t bear all the responsibility, as Clinton’s wording suggests, as the majority of bankruptcies happened as the overall casino industry struggled. We rate her claim Mostly True. <div class='artembed'>",/factchecks/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/

Ohio's Steve Chabot compares Trump U to Clinton Foundation
","On his blog, Steve Chabot, Republican congressman for Ohio’s 1st District, tapped out some friendly advice in an open letter to presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump faces a pending lawsuit against his eponymous Trump University. As a ""recovering lawyer,"" Chabot wrote, ""settle the damn case, and apologize to the judge."" Earlier this month, Trump caused the GOP heartburn when he accused the federal judge over the case of being unfair because of his Mexican heritage. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, is a first-generation U.S. citizen, born in Indiana to Mexican parents. Chabot advised Trump to throw a blanket over his sticky legal situation ASAP, because, ""when it comes to ripping off the public, you’re a piker compared to Hillary and Bill Clinton."" (Definition of piker: a small-time gambler.) Chabot continued: Even the Obama Administration recognized the inherent conflict of interest issues with respect to the Clinton Foundation, and therefore recommended a ban on all contributions to the Foundation from foreign nations. The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and United Arab Emirates. We’re going to unpack that statement to see if the Clinton Foundation did violate a ban and accept millions. ‘Ban’ on foreign donations When the Obamas were prepping for their move into the White House in 2008, and Hillary Clinton was awaiting confirmation to the cabinet as secretary of state, Barack Obama’s Presidential Transitions Team and the CEO of the Clinton Foundation drew up a Memorandum of Understanding, with provisions to deal with conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts. In the memorandum, the foundation pledged to publish its contributions from 2008, ahead of Hillary Clinton’s confirmation as secretary of state. For the duration of Hillary Clinton’s service at the State Department, the memorandum said, the foundation would seek approval from the State Department’s ethics office before accepting donations from new foreign interests that hadn’t given in the past, or from past donors who upped their contributions from previous levels. Nowhere in the memorandum does the word ""ban"" appear. Memorandums of understanding are generally not legally binding. ‘Millions and millions?’ ‘Again and again?’ The Clinton Foundation accepted millions of dollars from Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar and Oman, which was allowed under the terms of the memorandum because they were previous donors. Oman is the only country included in Chabot’s blogged complaint. According to the foundation’s website, the Sultanate of Oman donated between $1 million and $5 million while Clinton was at the State Department (the foundation discloses its funding in ranges). This donation was not prohibited by the memorandum. The Washington Post reported that the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia did not donate to the Clinton Foundation until after Clinton left the secretary of state’s post, in 2013. Our own reporting found the same thing.  That leaves Algeria. Algeria! On Jan. 12, 2010, the day after a massive earthquake struck Haiti, Clinton Foundation officials admitted that they failed to seek State Department approval before accepting an unsolicited donation from the Embassy of Algeria of $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund. The foundation staff told us the foundation did not seek pre-approval in part because it did not have prior knowledge of Algeria’s intended contribution and in part because of the urgency of Haiti’s needs. The donation was disclosed on the foundation’s website. Our ruling Chabot wrote, ""The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman and United Arab Emirates."" The agreement, a memorandum of understanding, was not a ban. At the very least, the Clinton Foundation accepted $1.5 million from Algeria and Oman, and at most, $5.5 million. Oman’s donation was allowed under the memo’s terms, but Algeria’s was not. Is the amount likely ""millions and millions?"" Probably. The Clinton Foundation has accepted funds from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, too, but not while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.

"['Debt', 'Deficit', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Federal debt was a frequent talking point during Trump's 2016 campaign
","Political reporter Jonathan Swan sat down with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for an interview that aired on HBO Monday to gather his thoughts and reactions immediately following the final presidential debate on Oct. 22. The pair touched on a range of issues but paid special attention to the national debt and the Republican Party’s wavering interest in reducing it under President Donald Trump, whose administration has overseen trillions added to the national debt. Swan kicked off the conversation by paraphrasing a quote from former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. During a trip to Britain earlier this year, Mulvaney remarked on Republicans’ shifting attitude on reducing the debt. ""My party is very interested in deficits when there is a Democrat in the White House. The worst thing in the whole world is deficits when Barack Obama was the president. Then Donald Trump became president, and we’re a lot less interested as a party,"" Mulvaney said, according to the Washington Post. When Swan asked Cruz to respond to Mulvaney’s portrayal, Cruz emphasized his own personal concerns about the rising debt. ""I’m very worried about the debt. I’m worried about it under Trump,"" Cruz said. ""Now to be fair, Trump didn’t campaign on cutting the debt."" That’s when Swan pointed to comments Trump made during his 2016 campaign signaling his intent to ""get rid of the $19 trillion in debt … over a period of eight years"" — a feat that critics called wildly impossible. But Cruz doubled down on his statement. ""Do I wish that it was a higher priority for the president to rein in spending and the debt? Yes. (But) he didn’t run principally on reining in spending and the debt. That’s not what he promised to do,"" Cruz said. The national debt — now pegged at around $27 trillion — is an issue that comes up in every presidential campaign. Let’s review Trump’s statements addressing the debt and deficits during his 2016 bid. ‘King of debt’ Trump has weighed in on the rising national debt before, during and after his 2016 campaign, and on occasion he’s proposed ways to reduce it. In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" in 2010, for instance, he floated the idea of imposing harsher taxes on China to finance debt payments. When Trump launched his first campaign for president in 2015, he committed to addressing the national debt: ""Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we’re in a bubble."" His campaign website in 2015 and 2016 listed reforming the U.S.-China trade relationship as a way to reduce the debt and deficit ""so China cannot use financial blackmail against us."" And his tax plan ensured that it would ""not add to our enormous debt and deficit,"" according to archives of his campaign website collected by the Wayback Machine. (Trump’s major tax code overhaul, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, was projected to increase the national debt by about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.) During his 2016 campaign, Trump described himself on numerous occasions as the ""king of debt"" in an effort to portray himself as someone more than capable of drawing down debt. ""I’m great with debt. Nobody knows debt more than me. I’ve made a fortune by using debt, and if things don’t work out I renegotiate the debt. That’s a smart thing, not a stupid thing,"" Trump said on ""CBS This Morning"" in June 2016. ""I like debt for my company, but I don’t like debt for the country. … We’ll have to start chopping that debt down,"" he said. His proposal to erase the national debt was revealed in an interview with the Washington Post’s Bob Woodward during the 2016 presidential primaries. Trump: ""We’ve got to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt."" Woodward: ""How long would that take?"" Trump: ""I think I could do it fairly quickly, because of the fact the numbers —"" Woodward: ""What’s fairly quickly?"" Trump: ""Well, I would say over a period of eight years."" Critics noted that reducing the debt in eight years couldn’t be done even if all basic government functions were eliminated and all national assets were sold off. And Trump walked back that commitment in an interview with Fortune a month later, pledging to reduce a portion of the debt rather than all of it. (A PolitiFact analysis of that commitment ruled it a Promise Broken.) Trump’s comments on the debt continued during the 2016 general election campaign. During a rally in September, he said ""we have a country that is essentially a debtor nation right now. So we’re going to make our country wealthy again."" And during the presidential debates he highlighted proposals for slashing both the deficit — when the government spends more in a year than it takes in — and the national debt, or the total amount the government owes. First on Sept. 26: ""We have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, almost $800 billion a year. That means, who’s negotiating these trade deals? We have people that are political hacks that are negotiating our trade deals."" And again on Oct. 9: ""I will bring our energy companies back, they’ll be able to compete, they’ll make money, they’ll pay off our national debt. They’ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous."" His promise to reduce the debt through other measures have continued into his presidency. In June 2017, Trump partly justified the country’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord by tying it to the national debt. ""America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that,"" he said during a Rose Garden press conference. And in an address to the nation the next month, before a Senate vote on the Affordable Care Act, Trump excoriated the Obama-era program and championed his own repeal and replace plan. ""The Obamacare repeal and replace plan would significantly reduce the federal deficit. So it would be good for the federal government, it’ll cost you less money by a lot, and it will be a much better plan. You can’t do better than that,"" Trump said. Our ruling Cruz said that Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign didn’t promise to reduce the national debt and that he ""didn’t run principally on reigning in spending and the debt."" The issue of U.S. national debt may not receive as much airtime or grab as many headlines as Trump’s other campaign promises, like forcing Mexico to pay for a southern border wall, but Trump repeatedly raised concerns over the rising debt and pledged to reduce it during his first presidential campaign. And he has repeated those concerns as president, even as it has ballooned. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/oct/30/ted-cruz/federal-debt-was-frequent-talking-point-during-tru/
"['Education', 'Taxes', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden misstates price of his free public college plan
","In an interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" Joe Biden slipped up while describing his plan to make public colleges free for all families with incomes below $125,000. ""I can send every qualified person to a four-year college in their state for $150 billion,"" he told interviewer Norah O’Donnell.  In voiceover, O’Donnell said that Biden’s staff had later reached out to CBS to tell them that Biden had misspoke. ""The cost of free public college could be twice as much as he said,"" O’Donnell said. Biden’s initial statement was wrong, but we were interested in how his campaign had calculated the price of the free public college plan.  When we reached out and asked about their methodology, Biden’s campaign walked us through the variables it considered to arrive at its estimate. It also pointed us to an independent Georgetown study that analyzed the financial effects of the proposal.  Biden’s free public college plan is based on Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s College for All Act of 2017, which stalled in committee. The proposal would make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families with incomes below $125,000. Students receiving other forms of financial aid, such as Pell Grants, could use that aid to cover attendance costs beyond tuition, like room and board and transportation.  The idea is that by increasing the number of people who go to college, the U.S. would produce more college graduates. And more college graduates would in turn benefit from higher earnings in the labor market, thereby generating substantial tax revenue. To determine the overall price of the program, the Biden campaign calculated the total cost of the plan and subtracted the projected gains in tax revenue to arrive at a net cost of $300 billion over 10 years, according to a campaign spokesperson.  The gross cost of Biden’s proposal — the total price of the plan not accounting for an increase of tax revenue — would be several times higher than its net cost. An analysis by the Penn-Wharton Budget Model estimated that the gross cost of the plan would come to $1.38 trillion over 10 years. The plan’s price tag would also depend on how public college enrollment numbers change after its enactment. The Penn-Wharton Budget Model assumed a 5% growth in four-year public college enrollment, while the Biden campaign assumed that enrollment rates would remain relatively constant. It suggested that there would not be a four-year college surge because Biden plans to make other forms of higher education more affordable as well, including community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, and workforce training programs. Finally, the campaign’s estimate accounts for phasing in the free public college plan over a number of years. It also assumes that states would share a third of the financial burden. So, that $300 billion figure is a measure of net federal costs. States would pay an additional $150 billion to fund the plan by the Biden campaign’s calculations. The Biden campaign said that it didn’t have enough resources to run detailed models on the costs of the free-college plan, making $300 billion an educated estimate rather than a hard price tag.  But independent researchers have calculated the net cost of Biden’s public college plan and come to similar conclusions about its price.  A report written by Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, and Jenna Sablan, a former assistant research professor at the center, found that the gross cost of Biden’s plan would reach $683.1 billion over an 11-year period.  But the plan could generate an additional $371.4 billion in federal and state income taxes after 11 years, if graduation rates remain at current levels, the researchers found. By the 11th year, the yearly tax revenue generated by the plan would begin to offset its annual cost, and the net cost of the plan would continue to shrink in the years going forward. This would bring the total price of the plan to roughly $311.7 billion over an 11-year period, the study found. Since states would be paying about a third of this amount, net federal costs would be around $205.7 billion.  In the ""60 Minutes"" interview, Biden said that he would be able to pay for the free college plan by raising the corporate minimum tax rate to 15%. According to the campaign, the corporate minimum tax rate would raise $400 billion over ten years, more than enough to offset the estimated $300 billion necessary to enact the public college plan.  However, Factcheck.org compiled estimates from three independent tax analysis centers, all of which found that the campaign is overstating the amount of revenue that would be generated by a corporate minimum tax. The Penn-Wharton Budget Model, which represents the high-end of these estimates, found that raising the corporate tax rate to 15% would only generate $227 billion.  On ""60 Minutes,"" Joe Biden said, ""I can send every qualified person to a four-year college in their state for $150 billion."" The Biden campaign later told CBS that Biden had misspoke and that the free public college plan would actually cost double that amount. A campaign spokesperson told PolitiFact the estimated cost would add up to about $300 billion over 10 years. That seems to square with a report by the Georgetown Center on Education, which calculated the cost of Biden’s public college plan and arrived at a similar estimate: $683.1 billion over an 11-year period, generating an additional $371.4 in tax revenue.  However, that’s not what Biden said on 60 Minutes. We rate his claim that it would cost $150 billion False.",/factchecks/2020/oct/30/joe-biden/biden-misstates-price-his-free-public-college-plan/
"['Income', 'Women', 'Workers', 'Abigail Spanberger']","
Are the majority of minimum wage earners mothers, as Spanberger says?
","When it comes to raising the minimum wage, the candidates in Virginia’s closely-watched 7th District congressional race have polar opposite views. Democratic incumbent Abigail Spanberger has voted for a bill that would gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2025. She says the current wage of $7.25 an hour, set in 2009, has lost much of its purchase power and can’t support a family. Republican challenger Nick Freitas opposes efforts to raise the wage, saying it would strap businesses already maimed by the coronavirus crisis, and force layoffs. While debating the issue on Oct. 20, the candidates gave sharply different descriptions of typical minimum wage earners.  Freitas said they are young, entry-level workers. ""If you’re looking for a way to systematically insure greater income inequality, then doubling the cost of hiring someone who’s young or has low-skill labor; that needs that first job to be able to rise up in the marketplace, that’s the way to do it,"" he said. Spanberger dismissed his description. ""The majority of minimum wage workers are not young people entering the workforce,"" she said. ""They are mothers, predominantly single mothers and oftentimes women of color."" We wondered which description was more accurate, and decided we could get an answer by fact checking Spanberger’s definitive statement. Freitas’ statement has ambiguity, which makes it a bad candidate for the Truth-O-Meter. He suggests young people are a large portion of minimum wage earners, which requires interpretation. Spanberger says flat out that the majority are mothers - a measurable claim.   We couldn’t find evidence that supports Spanberger’s statement, even after reviewing information her campaign sent us. Dearth of data There’s not much statistical information available on the nation’s minimum wage earners, largely because the wage varies from state to state.  In 21 states - including Virginia - it’s set at the federal minimum of $7.25. (Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam signed a bill in April that will gradually increase the wage to $15 an hour in 2026. The first step will occur on May 1, 2021. Freitas voted against the bill.) Twenty-nine states have set their rates higher than the federal minimum - all the way up to $13.50 in Washington. And some cities have set their minimum wage above their state’s floor. The large differences make efforts to statistically characterize minimum wage earners across the nation ""thorny,"" according to David Cooper, a senior economic analyst at left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. There is, however, some data available on the minimum wage earners from the 21 states that allow the $7.25 federal floor, kept by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It estimates only 392,000 U.S. non-tip employees worked at the bottom wage in 2019 - a half percent of the nation’s hourly workers. Freitas’ suggestion that they’re mainly young people trying to break into the workforce is pretty accurate. BLS estimates 59 percent of the federal minimum wage earners were aged 16 to 24. We don't know how many of these earners are working their first job; BLS doesn’t track that.  Conversely, the statistics undercut Spanberger’s assertion that ""the majority of minimum wage workers are not young people entering the workforce."" Minimum wage moms We asked Spanberger’s campaign where she got her information that most minimum wage earners are mothers, but did not get a specific answer.  Among other things, the campaign sent the 2019 BLS statistics on federal minimum wage workers that we’ve already discussed. The data doesn’t address the number who are mothers. Its closest information is that 68% of all federal minimum wage earners are women, and two-thirds of those women are between 16 and 24.   The campaign also sent us research from the Economic Policy Institute that undermines Spanberger’s claim. EPI estimates 33.5 million people from all states would get raises if the federal minimum wage was lifted $15 in 2024. That includes 7.8 million moms - or 23% of the beneficiaries. EPI estimates that 4.1 million of the working moms would be single parents - or 12% of all beneficiaries. 
Our ruling Spanberger, in debate, said, ""The majority of minimum wage workers"" are mothers.  There’s not much data on bottom wage earners across the nation because the minimum wage varies in most states. The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps limited statistics about minimum wage workers in the 21 states that allow the federal floor or $7.25 an hour, but it does not track the number or percentage who are moms. We were unable to find data on the number of minimum wage moms, and Spanberger didn’t come up with any. Some of the backup information her campaign actually cast doubt on her claim. Spanberger fails in her burden to prove her claim, so we rate it False.  ",/factchecks/2020/oct/30/abigail-spanberger/are-majority-minimum-wage-earners-mothers-spanberg/

Cooper right about Forest education board attendance
","Lt. Governor Dan Forest thinks he would be a better governor than Roy Cooper. But Cooper says Forest hasn’t put in the work needed to hold the office. The two went at it on Oct. 14 in North Carolina’s lone gubernatorial debate. ""The Lieutenant Governor is on the state board of education where the state opening plans are discussed and voted on. And while I’m working with them and public health officials, he’s missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic,"" Cooper said. Forest responded by saying ""I’ve been to almost every one of those meetings, especially every voting meeting. My staff sits in. My education experts and advisors sit in on all of those meetings, we don’t miss a beat on an education meeting. We never have. We’ve always been present at all of them."" So what’s the truth here?  We’ll rate Cooper’s statement, since he’s the one bringing up the subject as an attack. He said Forest has missed almost half of North Carolina’s education board meetings during the pandemic. As it turns out, Cooper’s claim is almost spot-on. The Board of Education has not uploaded its meeting minutes since March. So we listened to audio files uploaded to YouTube. Then we asked the North Carolina Department of Instruction for attendance records. Cooper declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus on March 10, so we’re using that as the start date for the pandemic in North Carolina. There have been 28 meetings since then, according to Deanna Townsend-Smith, DPI’s director of board operations and policy. Most of them were over an hour long, meaning the board has spent well over 24 hours talking about education policy just in the last eight months. Forest has missed 13 of the 28 meetings, or 46%. Forest missed meetings on March 18 and 27. He attended five meetings in a row before missing seven out of 10 from the beginning of May to the end of July. He then missed four in a row between Sept. 3 and Oct. 7. In some cases, Forest arrived late to meetings but was still counted present.  ""Present does not always mean attendance for the entire meeting, but present at some point and time,"" Townsend-Smith said. It’s unclear why Forest missed the meetings. Neither his office nor his campaign responded to questions from PolitiFact this week. Forest said during the debate that his experts and advisors ""sit in on all"" of the meetings. Staff members can’t vote. And Townsend-Smith told PolitiFact that board members ""cannot have anyone attend the meeting on their behalf."" Forest ""may have had someone listening to the meeting on his behalf,"" she said, adding ""however that is not something that is within my purview and you would need to verify that with the LG’s office."" Forest has downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, saying the state should reopen schools without a mask mandate. DPI’s records show Forest missed votes that made changes to grading, testing and graduation requirements, set guidelines for remote learning, as well as another vote on grade point averages.  Cooper said Forest has ""missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic."" We’re not here to say whether or not Forest should have attended the meetings. However, we can say whether Cooper’s stat is correct. The state Department of Instruction says Forest has missed 13 of 28 meetings since the pandemic started. That means he’s missed 46% of the meetings.  That’s close enough to ""half"" for us.

Fact-checking a Trump campaign tweet that Pa. mail ballots arriving after Election Day won’t count
","President Donald Trump’s campaign declared on Wednesday that it had won a big election-integrity victory in Pennsylvania, one of several key battleground states that will likely determine the outcome of the election. ""Major decision protecting voting rights in Pennsylvania,"" deputy campaign manager and senior counsel Justin Clark tweeted. ""Ballots received after Election Day will not be counted. More to come, but big win for the rule of law."" He’s talking about guidance the Pennsylvania Department of State issued to county election officials on Wednesday instructing them to segregate ballots that arrive after 8 p.m. on Election Day. According to the guidance, these ballots will be processed separately. Nowhere in the guidance does it say the ballots won’t be counted at all. Pennsylvania law requires all ballots to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. But citing United States Postal Service delays, the state Supreme Court last month extended the deadline for this election so ballots can be received by mail until 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 6, if they are either postmarked by Election Day or have missing or illegible postmarks. Last month, Pennsylvania Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block that decision, saying it violates the state legislature’s constitutional right to set election rules. The justices split, 4-4, keeping the deadline extension intact. Perhaps hoping that Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the high court might yield a different outcome, the Pennsylvania Republican Party last Friday again asked the court to take up the issue and strike down the deadline extension. At the same time, a Republican congressional candidate sued in federal court to toss the extension. The Supreme Court denied Republicans' request to expedite consideration of their second request for relief, but the case remains open. That means the justices could still take up the case and ultimately reverse the deadline extension, even after Election Day. The guidance the Pennsylvania Department of State issued is designed to help counties prepare for that possibility. ""The secretary continues to defend the extension to ensure that every timely and validly cast mail-in and absentee ballot is counted,"" the guidance states.

Barrett didn’t participate in the decision not to expedite consideration of Republicans' latest request. Republicans argue the state Supreme Court’s deadline extension will allow mail ballots to be cast and counted after Election Day, a judicial overreach that steps on the state legislature’s constitutional right to decide how elections are run. Several of the court’s conservative justices appear willing to back that argument, with Justice Samuel Alito writing Wednesday that ""there is a strong likelihood that the state Supreme Court decision violates the federal constitution."" Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch joined in that opinion. Trump deputy campaign manager Justin Clark tweeted that Pennsylvania ""ballots received after Election Day will not be counted,"" citing guidance released on Wednesday by the Pennsylvania Department of State in a subsequent campaign email. The guidance instructs counties to segregate ballots that arrive after 8 p.m. on Election Day but does not say those ballots won’t be counted.

Detroit TV station accidentally airs fake election results during ‘The Bachelorette’ in systems test
","The third episode of ABC’s reality dating TV show ""The Bachelorette"" was defined by a shouting match, a celebrity-style roast and a whole lot of romance between bachelorette Clare Crawley and the season’s frontrunner, contestant Dale Moss. And, for some watchers in the Detroit area, the Oct. 27 episode also appeared to preview the results for the 2020 presidential election and other contests in Michigan. ""2020 election results air a week early!"" said the caption on one YouTube video viewed more than 95,000 times.  The video highlighted nearly two minutes from the broadcast as it aired on WXYZ Detroit, an ABC affiliate. According to the sidebar accompanying the broadcast, President Donald Trump won Michigan, capturing 50% of the vote to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s 44%.  The results looked authentic, leading commenters on the YouTube video to claim the election had been rigged because votes were being tallied a week before Election Day, on Nov. 3. But while the sidebar was real, the election results it showed were not. The sidebar, as the contestants on ""The Bachelor"" like to say, wasn’t there for the right reasons. In an apology statement posted to its website the following day, the TV station said the results displayed were ""randomly generated"" as part of a test of its systems ahead of Election Day. ""During the Bachelorette, WXYZ inadvertently aired an election result graphic as part of our testing of the systems we will use during election night coverage,"" the station said. ""The results displayed – the presidential race, the Senate race and a number of congressional races to name a few, were part of a test and NOT actual results. In Michigan, no ballots are counted before election day."" The mishap was covered by the Detroit Free Press and the New York Times. The broadcast’s mock results also showed Republican Senate candidate John James beating Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat, and Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens fending off their GOP challengers. In reality, those candidates will have to wait until Nov. 3 for the results to start rolling in.  A YouTube video said a broadcast of ABC’s ""The Bachelorette"" showed the 2020 election results a week early. WXYZ, a Detroit-area ABC affiliate, did show what appeared to be Election Day results in a sidebar accompanying its broadcast of the reality TV show. That generated some confusion. But the results shown were not real election results; they were randomly generated as part of a test of the affiliate’s system. Michigan’s ballots will be counted on Election Day. WXYZ made that clear in a statement posted Oct. 28, after the Oct. 27 YouTube video was uploaded.

Trump campaign uses cherry-picked video to attack Biden
","President Donald Trump’s campaign is using a snippet of video to show a moment when Joe Biden ostensibly stumbled when asked about court packing. The message is that Biden’s stumble was his staff’s cue to hustle reporters away.  In reality, the full video shows that Biden gave a lengthy answer, and then Biden’s staff began moving members of the press to attend the next campaign event.  The deceptive clip is now part of Trump’s rallies, appearing most recently at his Oct. 28 rally in Arizona. It started when Francis Brennan, the Trump campaign’s director of strategic response, tweeted the video excerpt. The campaign shared it that day on the Team Trump Facebook page and on Trump’s YouTube account. ""MUST WATCH: When asked about court-packing, Biden's staff immediately escorts the camera out,"" read the headline of the YouTube video posted to Trump’s YouTube page. The video clip is from Biden’s Oct. 26 appearance in Pennsylvania. It shows him talking with a small semi-circle of people. The clip begins with Biden’s signature pivot, ""Here’s the deal.""  ""One of the reasons that is important,"" Biden continues. ""Keep in mind, although they are going to vote on ..."" At this point, Biden pauses. Members of the press are in motion, moving and shifting away from where Biden is speaking with supporters. According to the Trump campaign, Biden’s staff were moving the press to protect him as he began to stumble.  But the full video, as streamed by ABC News and others, shows a different sequence. In the ABC News video, a supporter asks Biden about court packing by Republicans (see minute 4:50). Biden gives a long answer about forming a commission to explore options in federal judicial appointments, which are lifetime appointments. ""I’m not a big fan of court packing,"" Biden said. ""I’m going to listen to all of the ideas."" Biden said his commission would include conservative, liberal and middle-of-the-road scholars and would have six months to give him a list of options. After Biden finished, he joked with a nearby reporter and started talking about the courts again (which is where the Trump clip picks up).  The video shows that Biden is going on at even greater length with a single reporter as other reporters Biden started to move away. (See 6:45 in the video.).  Members of the media were directed down a path to a more open area where a lectern had been set up.  Biden later went to the lectern to take more questions. Asked about his plans for the Supreme Court, he repeated the answer he’d given earlier. The Trump campaign said that Biden staff hustled reporters away to cut off his stumbling answer to a question. The full video shows a different scene. Biden had already given a long answer to a question about court packing and seemed to be following up with one reporter for even more comments.

Did Ann Wagner vote to repeal pre-existing conditions protections?
","With the elections around the corner, Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District is in the eye of the storm. Democratic challenger Jill Schupp and incumbent Republican U.S. Rep.  Ann Wagner are battling for the district that includes parts of St. Louis, St. Charles and Jefferson counties. The Cook Political Report says the race is a toss-up. In one of Schupp’s attacks in a video on Facebook, Schupp stated: ""Rep. Wagner doesn't want you to know that she's voted five times against protecting pre-existing conditions."" In a time when people with pre-existing conditions are vulnerable, is it really true that she voted against these protections? Let’s take a look. Introduced in 2010, the Affordable Care Act was designed to broaden the reach of health care coverage. In the past decade, gaps in health coverage have decreased. Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration oppose the law and have taken steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act. One protection at the core of the Affordable Care Act outlaws denying coverage to those who live with pre-existing conditions. A pre-existing condition is a health problem that was around before someone’s health coverage began. According to the liberal Center for American Progress, Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District has more than 320,000 people living with pre-existing conditions. We asked Jill Schupp’s campaign to provide evidence of Wagner’s votes. Schupp’s communications director Natalie Edelstein provided five unsuccessful attempts by the Republican-led House to repeal the Affordable Care Act while President Barack Obama was in office. In 2013, Wagner voted to repeal the account restrictions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR 25).  In 2014, Wagner voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HRs 96).  In 2015, Wagner voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (HR 596).  In 2015, Wagner voted for a proposed amendment that repealed the Affordable Care Act (HR 27).  In 2015, Wagner voted again on the budget above which would establish a reserve fund and allow health care spending to be adjusted.  These votes are in line with Schupp’s claim. It’s worth noting that one of the votes is a second vote on the same budget. Also, only one of these is an actual vote to directly repeal the ACA, H.R. 596; the rest are mainly budget votes that cut or redirect funding to the ACA. HealthReformVotes.org, a website that tracks votes concerning health care reform, cites Wagner’s vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act as unfavorable to consumers.  We asked Wagner’s campaign to comment on this claim. Press secretary Arthur Bryant sent a history of Ann Wagner’s votes, as well as legislation Wagner has co-sponsored to keep people insured. Here are the votes sent by Wagner’s campaign from 2019: Wagner voted on HR 5 which would guarantee that no Americans could be denied coverage or charged higher premiums as a result of their health status. Wagner voted to recommit the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019, which would make it clear that pre-existing conditions protections cannot be waived under current law. Alongside colleagues in Congress, Wagner introduced the Protecting Patients with Preexisting Conditions Act in 2019. The act would amend the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to guarantee coverage even if the Affordable Care Act is completely repealed. The act also seeks to outlaw discriminatory premium rates. As it stands, the Protecting Patients with Pre-existing Conditions Act was introduced a year ago and hasn’t been acted on since. Another piece of legislation Wagner co-sponsored, HR 1066, aims to keep pre-existing conditions protections in place. Wagner also co-sponsored the Maintaining Protections with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2018. PolitiFact found that this (as well as another bill) has loopholes in denying coverage if companies do not have the capacity to do so. Schupp stated in a Facebook post that ""Ann Wagner doesn’t want you to know that she’s voted five times against protecting people with pre-existing conditions."" Wagner has repeatedly voted for legislation that repealed the Affordable Care Act, which establishes protections for those with pre-existing conditions. If the repeals had been successful, the protections for pre-existing conditions would be gone.  Wagner’s introduction of various bills as alternatives to the Affordable Care Act that would guarantee protections suggests that’s not the whole story. She has co-sponsored legislation to keep protections in place, but there are loopholes that could jeopardize coverage if the Affordable Care Act was dismantled.

Joni Ernst said she 'stood with the Dreamers' but hasn't always supported DACA
","Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst and her Democratic challenger in this year’s election, Theresa Greenfield, squared off in three televised debates to take on several topics important to Iowans, including immigration. Asked on Iowa Public Television the night of Sept. 28 if she supported residency, legal status, or citizenship for Dreamers – immigrant youths qualifying to stay in the United States under the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act – Ernst said: ""I have been very clear with DACA. Even in my campaign six years ago I stood for those Dreamers."" Asked if this would mean granting legal residency or citizenship for Dreamers, Ernst responded, ""I would support more of a legal residency."" DACA, which is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, protects juveniles who came into the United States under specified circumstances from deportation. Immigrants in the program have to renew their DACA status every two years. We wanted to look at the statement because of how emotional this topic is and how significant it is politically. We looked into statements from Ernst’s office as a U.S. senator, her voting record, her 2014 campaign for the seat she holds, and her performance in 2014 debates for the seat with her then-challenger, Democrat Bruce Braley. The Ernst campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s request to comment, although campaign spokesperson Brendan Conley sent on what he called background links to news stories in which Ernst said she would not vote to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Our research has shown that while she has consistently claimed to support the Dreamers, she has voted both for and against legislation that would grant permanent legal residency to those with DACA status. During a U.S. Senate debate on Oct. 11, 2014, Ernst was asked if she would try to repeal DACA. She first responded, ""No, I would not."" She then elaborated, saying, ""There are a number of children who have been brought here not of their own accord, and I do support allowing those children some of the freedoms that are here in the United States. We are a country of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws, which is why with a comprehensive immigration plan I don’t support the amnesty for those adults that knowingly come here when it is illegal to do so."" A statement on her Senate website is consistent with what Ernst said at the debate. She says on that website she ""supported efforts to block overreaching executive amnesty"" but she would like to ""modernize our broken immigration system by enacting reforms to promote improved legal avenues for workers and families."" Her website also includes a statement on DACA from September 2017 in which she states, in regard to the Dreamers, ""…we must show compassion toward these children. While I do not support giving them citizenship, we must identify and pursue a measured approach that addresses their unique situation, but also respects the importance of our immigration laws and discourages future illegal immigration."" Ernst also made an appearance on Iowa Press in 2017, where she said she would ""vote to grant legal permanent residency to those that are currently covered under DACA."" She said while this was a point of conflict, some legislators ""would insist on immediate citizenship"" while others ""would insist on absolutely no citizenship, under any circumstances"" for DACA recipients. She went on to say that she stood somewhere in the middle, and that she would like to see a permanent status for those who are covered by DACA. Ernst’s voting record in the Senate shows mixed approaches. In 2018, Ernst voted against two proposals that would have provided a path to legal residency for Dreamers. One proposal was an amendment attached to an Internal Revenue Service bill that would allow a tax credit to be used to pay for unsubsidized COBRA health coverage. The amendment, S. Amdt 1958 to H.R. 2579, was introduced by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and called for an end to removing DACA recipients from the country and to adjust their status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on a conditional basis. DACA recipients no longer eligible for the designation because of misconduct would not be granted this status change under the amendment. A Senate cloture vote to bring the amendment up for approval failed 54 to 45 in favor but needing 60 yes votes to move forward. While some Republicans voted to move the matter to a final decision, Ernst voted no. The second proposal Ernst voted against was another amendment in the same IRS-related bill introduced by Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Delaware, S. Amdt. 1955 to S. Amdt. 1958, which included the same provision for DACA recipients. The Senate decision to move toward a final vote on that amendment also failed, 52 to 47 for cloture, with some Republicans, but not Ernst, voting to move forward. Ernst voted to approve one 2018 proposal, S. Amdt. 1959 to H.R. 2579, which includes an opportunity for 1.8 million DACA or DACA-eligible residents to earn citizenship. She called the legislation in a statement on her government website ""a reasonable approach to shielding children illegally brought to our country through no fault of their own while also taking the meaningful steps to ensure nobody finds themselves in the same situation in the future."" According to a report from Iowa Public Radio, Ernst said at a town hall meeting in Sigourney, Iowa, in 2018, ""I’ve been an outspoken proponent for our DACA recipients. I think we have to find a pathway forward. They are contributing to our communities. They’re very important to us."" A year earlier, she delivered a similar message in Cedar Rapids. Ernst has stated multiple times during and since her 2014 campaign that she supports DACA recipients and would vote to grant them legal permanent residency. However, her voting record does not completely indicate this. She has voted both for and against legislation that would grant legal permanent residency to DACA recipients throughout her term. When she had a chance to cross party lines and join a handful of other Republicans to support ending Dreamer deportations she voted ""no."" For these reasons, we rated the claim that Ernst has been clear with her stance on DACA and that even six years ago she stood for the Dreamers as being Half True.

Yes, because of gerrymandering only one Republican Assembly seat has flipped Democratic since 2013
","Wisconsin is among the most gerrymandered states in the country, but have Democrats only flipped a single Republican seat in the last seven years? That’s the claim from state Rep. Robyn Vining, a Democrat who accomplished that feat when she beat Republican Matt Adamczyk by 138 votes in 2018. That handed Vining, D-Wauwatosa, the District 14 seat previously held by Republican Dale Kooyenga, who ran for the state Senate that year.  In an Oct. 25, 2020, episode of WISN-TV’s ""UpFront"" program, Vining said her win was unique during the tenure of Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. The Rochester Republican has headed the chamber since 2013. ""I’m the only Democrat to beat the speaker,"" Vining said, discussing her 2020 campaign. ""This is the first time Speaker Vos has lost a seat, and so he wants it back."" A federal court said in 2016 the maps drawn by Wisconsin Republicans in 2011 were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years, designed to ""secure Republican control of the Assembly under any likely future electoral scenario for the remainder of the decade."" Calculating gerrymandering is an imprecise business, but two studies have agreed with that court finding, ranking Wisconsin among the most five skewed states in the nation. Has the maneuver really been as beneficial to Republicans as Vining claims? Republicans control nearly two-thirds of the 99-member Assembly, a level they have held have since the new maps were drawn in 2011. Wisconsin Democrats enter the 2020 election hoping to cut into Republicans 63-34 majority, while the GOP is looking to lock in a veto-proof majority. RELATED: Attacking Republicans, Democratic state senator says Wisconsin among most gerrymandered states Gerrymandering is done by drawing legislative boundaries in such a way that voters in one party are concentrated in a limited number of districts, while voters from the other are spread out just enough to ensure victories. Lawmakers accomplish this by drawing irregularly shaped districts that strategically include and exclude certain groups of voters rather than cordoning off districts based on geography or municipality. The result in Wisconsin is Democrats tend to win their districts by a landslide, while Republicans win by narrower margins. The 2018 election highlighted this, as Republicans didn’t even bother sending out a candidate in 27 of the 36 Assembly districts Democrats won, Ballotpedia reported. In the general election contests with two candidates, Democratic winners outpolled their Republican counterparts by an average of 37%, while Republican winners won by an average of 20%. In another sign of the lack of competitive districts, a whopping 49 Assembly races were uncontested in 2016. With that context, let’s focus in on Vining’s claim about seat flipping since 2013. There were three elections in that span — every Assembly member is up for election in even-numbered years — and the Republican majority hardly budged. Republicans held 63 seats after the 2014 election, picked up one in the 2016 election, then dropped back to 63 with Vining’s victory in 2018. Most Democratic victories in that span came from incumbents. But a review of the Wisconsin Blue Book’s election results for 2014, 2016 and 2018 shows more than a dozen non-incumbent Democrats were elected to the Assembly in that span.  For all but Vining, however, those lawmakers were filling a seat previously held by another Democrat. The closest call came in 2014 in District 51, centered around Dodgeville an hour west of Madison. Republican Todd Novak won the seat by 65 votes that year, and it stayed close in the two elections since, which he won by 723 votes in 2016 and 332 votes in 2018. Vining said her victory in 2018 was the first seat to flip from Republican to Democrat since Vos took over the Assembly in 2013. Almost every Wisconsin district has been locked one way or another as a result of the maps drawn by Republicans in 2011. Only one district flipped from Democrat to Republican in that span.  And only one flipped from Republican to Democrat — in line with Vining’s statement.

Toalson Reisch is off about Columbia schools’ test scores
","On Oct. 6, Cheri Toalson Reisch joined community members for a protest in support of returning children to in-person classes. Toalson Reisch is the Republican incumbent running for Missouri House District 44. In a Facebook post supporting students re-entering classrooms, she spoke about how Columbia Public Schools in her district are affected by the pandemic.  ""All schools are open in Boone County except Columbia. Their kids are suffering,"" Toalson Reisch wrote. Toalson Reisch then made this claim: ""The Columbia school buildings in my district have the lowest test scores in all of Boone County."" She linked the scores to the fact that CPS schools are online, while other school districts in Boone County are teaching in person, such as the Hallsville R-IV school district. Toalson Reisch’s district includes Hallsville and parts of Columbia.  Words like ""most"" or ""lowest"" are warning bells at PolitiFact. So we decided to look deeper into this claim.  In an email, Toalson Reisch said she was referring to Annual Performance Reports, or ""APR"" scores, specifically for Blue Ridge Elementary, Alpha Hart Lewis Elementary, and Eliot Battle Elementary in the Columbia schools district. We used other elementary and intermediate schools in the county as a comparison.   Missouri APR scores rate schools on their performance using these terms: floor, approaching, on track or exceeding. Floor is the worst rating, while exceeding is the best. A floor rating means the school improved by less than 1% on Missouri Assessment Program tests. An exceeding rating means the school improved by 5% or greater.  According to Mallory McGowin, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Education, the APR is calculated based on three principles: status, progress and growth. Each school gets a rating in one of these principles, as well as a category. For example: growth in math, status in language arts, etc.  Here’s how McGowin explained each principle: Status: Student achievement levels. Progress: A school district’s improvement from prior years. Growth: The gains students are making over time. Columbia Public Schools spokesperson Michelle Baumstark says state assessments weren’t given this year due to the pandemic, and she said APR scores weren’t calculated at the school building level for the 2017-18 or 2018-19 school years. The data that Toalson Reisch is referencing wasn’t calculated since the 2016-17 school year. Any data she is referencing is over three years old.  However, McGowin was able to provide building level data for Boone County. The school data showed how each school performed in different categories like language arts and math scores. We looked at each school based on the number of ""floor"" ratings it received. Floor ratings ranged from 2 to 21. High schools in Boone County had the most floor ratings on average, between 12 and 21. The range for middle and elementary schools was from two to 12.  According to the data provided by the Missouri Department of Education, here’s how the Columbia schools Toalson Reisch spoke about performed in the past two school years. Blue Ridge Elementary: 10 floor ratings Alpha Hart Lewis Elementary: 12 floor ratings Eliot Battle Elementary: Seven floor ratings But some other schools in Toalson Reisch’s district performed as bad or worse during the past two school years. These schools are in her district but are not in Columbia: Centralia Intermediate: 12 floor ratings Cedar Ridge Elementary: 12 floor ratings Harrisburg Elementary: 12 floor ratings While Alpha Hart Lewis had as many floor ratings as these schools, the other schools Toalson Reisch provided are actually doing better. Toalson Reisch said, ""The Columbia school buildings in my district have the lowest test scores in all of Boone County.""  Elementary schools such as Alpha Hart Lewis Elementary and Blue Ridge Elementary have some of the lowest APR scores in Boone County. However, there are other schools in Boone County that are just as low or lower.

Yes, Biden seeks to eliminate policy that reduces inheritance taxes
","On the campaign trail back in October 2019, before he was the Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden pitched his plan to provide two years of free community college to students. His campaign said the plan would be funded in part by eliminating a tax policy called ""stepped-up basis"" that reduces inheritance taxes. Stepped-up basis provides a big benefit to those who inherit certain assets, including real estate. It means that the person who inherited the asset only has to pay tax on its gains in value beginning from the time it was inherited, rather than from the time it was originally purchased, according to the nonprofit Tax Policy Center.  The difference in tax liability can be significant, the Tax Policy Center points out, and Facebook users noted the same thing. One Oct. 25 Facebook post says, ""Did you know Biden wants to get rid of something called ‘stepped up basis’??? How does this affect you! When your parents pass and leave you the family house normally you would inherit that property at what it is worth today. If you were to sell that house you would only pay taxes on the gain from what it is worth today and what it sells for. If Biden does away with ‘stepped up basis’ you will inherit the property for what your parents paid for the property. If you decide to sell you will pay taxes on the difference between the original purchase price and what it sells for today."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although, in this case, the claim gets it right.  Biden’s campaign team specifically mentioned eliminating stepped-up basis in October 2019 when Biden unveiled his community-college plan, ABC News reported. The issue came up again in June, when Biden told donors at a fundraising event that he intends to roll back Trump’s tax cuts and ""close loopholes like capital gains and stepped-up basis,"" according to CNBC.  Stepped-up basis takes its name from the ""step up"" to fair market value that happens when a person inherits certain assets. The basis — which is another way of saying the original purchase price, plus improvements, minus depreciation — adjusts to current fair market value at the time it is bequeathed.  If the asset is sold after it’s inherited, then the stepped-up value is the base that gains are measured against for taxes. Any gains in value from the time of original purchase to the time the asset is ""stepped up"" to market value when inherited are not taxed.  The policy has been part of the U.S. tax code since 1921, according to The Hill, which reports that its origins are unclear but likely related to the difficulty in determining the original price of assets at that time. Biden has said he wants to eliminate the policy, and if he is elected, he can propose changes to tax law, but only Congress can enact tax laws.  A Facebook post claims that Biden wants to get rid of stepped-up basis, a tax policy that allows people inheriting and selling certain assets to only pay tax on the increase in value from the time it was inherited, rather than on the gains in value from the time it was originally purchased. Biden and his campaign have said that he wants to eliminate stepped-up basis. His campaign says the increased tax revenue would be used to help fund Biden’s plan for free community college.

Donald Trump wrong that a winner has to be announced Election Night
","As Nov. 3 approaches, President Donald Trump has been expressing alarm about ballot counting extending beyond Election Night. ""Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd,"" Trump tweeted on Oct. 26 Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd. The following day, Trump added in remarks to reporters, ""It would be very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on Nov. 3, instead of counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws.""  However, the president was wrong. When the media ""calls"" a presidential race — which may or may not happen on Election Night — it is because they feel that projections from the current results are strong enough to announce one candidate over the other. It’s not an official result.  ""There are no official results on Election Night — there never have been,"" said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University constitutional law professor who specializes in elections. ""Election Night tallies are always just preliminary, pending certification of the canvass of returns under state law, which takes time. Every state has a law on this point."" Especially in this year’s election, when many voters are sending in their ballots or voting early in person rather than voting on Election Day due to the coronavirus pandemic, experts say it will take a decisive victory by one candidate or the other to be able to declare a winner on Election Night or early the following morning. (Trump’s tweet was later flagged by Twitter as potentially harming the integrity of the election.). Here are some of the specific reasons why Trump is off-base. According to the National Conference on State Legislatures, 19 states have laws allowing ballots to be counted if they arrive after Election Day, but are postmarked on Election Day (or, in some states, the day before Election Day). This number could vary this year due to pending litigation. In many cases, such postmark rules for absentee ballots have been around ""for years,"" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. In close races, even a modest number of late-arriving ballots could prove decisive. Many states allow service members stationed overseas a grace period for ballots they mail back to the mainland. For instance, states like Texas and West Virginia will require overseas military ballots to be received by Nov. 9, while others require a postmark, but not receipt, by Nov. 3, such as Georgia and Nevada. Provisional ballots are those that are cast when a voter’s eligibility is in question. If election officials resolve those questions, the ballot will be counted, but the checking and counting process takes time. The rules for provisional ballots were streamlined by the Help America Vote Act, a federal law passed in 2002. ""Provisional ballots by their very nature cannot be counted on Election Day or Election Night and must be verified subsequently as part of the canvassing of returns,"" Foley said. Under federal law, states have until Dec. 8, or six days before the presidential electors vote, to finalize their ballot count. This deadline acknowledges, as a matter of federal law, that states are not obligated to have a final official result on Election Night.  Even if a projected winner were to be announced by television networks and other media companies on Election Night, nothing would be official until the presidential electors cast their ballots on Dec. 14, and Congress officially counts the electoral votes on Jan. 6. As a practical matter, Weil said, ""the vast majority of ballots will be counted within two or three days of Election Day, even in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that cannot start counting absentee ballots until the day before Election Day or on Election Day itself."" The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump said that ""counting ballots for two weeks ... is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws."" He’s wrong. Post-election day time to count absentee ballots, overseas military ballots, and provisional ballots are enshrined in both federal and state law. In addition, federal law allows states until more than a month after the election to finalize their results for the casting of electoral votes. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

No, Harris did not break Ohio law with election site visit
","Social media posts falsely suggest that Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, broke Ohio election laws when she addressed voters outside of an early voting site in Cleveland. ""Three strikes for Kamala’s campaign events Sunday, yells at people in line to vote in Ohio, may have broken laws,"" stated a headline on DJHJ Media, a conservative opinion website. A link to the article was posted on Facebook Oct. 26. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The DJHJ story included a tweet by conservative actor James Woods that showed a video clip of Harris speaking Oct. 24 outside the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections building. Woods wrote ""you can literally be arrested for campaigning at a polling station."" Neither the tweet nor the DJHJ article provided proof that Harris violated state laws restricting campaigning near a polling place.  County election officials told PolitiFact that Harris followed the law. States often have laws prohibiting electioneering at polling sites in an effort to protect voters from feeling intimidated. These laws usually set boundaries explaining how far people campaigning must stand from voters or an election site. Ohio laws state that near polling sites: No person can engage in any kind of election campaigning within 10 feet of any voter waiting in line. U.S. flags shall be placed 100 feet from a polling place to mark the zone where people can’t campaign. No person can ""solicit or in any manner attempt to influence any elector in casting the elector's vote."" Harris spoke to a long line of voters on the first day of early in-person voting in Cuyahoga County, according to the press pool report by Buzzfeed reporter Henry Gomez. There was a ""massively long line of early voters snaked around the building on Euclid Avenue, down East 30th Street and around the block,"" he wrote. Harris spoke to the crowd using a cordless microphone before walking up and down the stretch of East 30th between Euclid and Chester and waving at voters.  In a 39-second video by Seth Richardson, a Cleveland.com politics reporter, Harris didn’t mention any candidates on the ballot but gave a pep talk about the importance of voting. ""Thank you for voting and voting early. Your vote is your voice, your voice is your vote, There is  so much at stake — don’t let anyone ever take your power. ….  You are going to make the difference,"" she said.  Harris posted an 18-second video of the event on Twitter. After her brief comments, she danced to some music being played across the street by a DJ who called out ""Senator! Senator! Senator!"" according to the press pool report. As for the 10 foot rule, eyeballing the video, Harris appears to be more than 10 feet from the voters lined up on the sidewalk. She’s separated from the line by two traffic lanes, which are typically about 10 feet wide in urban areas. We couldn’t see the flags in the Twitter videos of Harris marking the 100 foot barrier. But Harris was speaking to voters in a line that extended beyond the election office. WKSU, public radio in Ohio, wrote that Harris ""made a brief stop across the street from the line — and outside the 100 foot neutral zone — to thank people for voting."" Tony Kaloger, Cuyahoga’s election and compliance administrator, sent us a statement about the unannounced visit by Harris to the earling voting site.  Several local elections employees including the director ""were outside during the majority of her stop and witnessed no violations of Ohio's electioneering laws,"" the statement said. Harris did not come onto the property of the elections center. She was surrounded by Secret Service agents, and no voter or bystander was permitted to approach her.  ""There are several officers on-site at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections Early Vote Center tasked mainly with managing traffic and voter flow,"" the statement said. ""They will step in to assist our staff with the enforcement of the neutral zone (100 feet from the entrance or 10 feet from the voters in line when the line extends further than 100 feet) as necessary. No assistance was required during the Senator's visit."" The county pointed to a two-page excerpt from a 2019 directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, that explains where people are allowed to campaign. Part of that directive says: ""Nothing in Ohio’s election laws prohibit a person or entity from campaigning, displaying campaign material, or distributing food outside of the neutral zone of a polling location (i.e., outside of the flags marking the 100 foot barrier or beyond 10 feet from any elector waiting in line to vote, if the line to vote extends beyond the flags)."" Sabrina Singh, a spokesperson for Harris, said Harris ""stood behind the 100 foot boundary line beyond the neutral zone."" A headline in a story posted on Facebook stated that Harris ""may have broken laws"" when she campaigned outside a voting site in Ohio. A county election official said that Harris did not violate laws against electioneering near a polling site. Police officers were on site during the visit by Harris and are allowed to help election officials enforce the neutral zone, but the county said that wasn’t required. We rate this statement False.

A $10,000 Obamacare penalty? Doubtful.
","A viral Facebook post claims that former President Barack Obama’s health insurance law penalized a family a large amount of money for not buying health insurance and that President Donald Trump was responsible for stopping the practice. The post features writing on the back of a car windshield that says, ""Because our family couldn’t afford health insurance, Obama/Biden penalized us about $10,000, then took that $10,000 and used it to pay for others’ free Obamacare. Trump ended that theft."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with Facebook.) We found a similar post on Instagram. The post appears to refer to the individual mandate penalty, a tax under the Affordable Care Act placed on those who chose not to get health insurance. At the end of 2017, Republican-backed tax legislation, also supported by Trump, zeroed out the fine. Beginning in 2019, people could no longer be penalized for not having health insurance. Thus, the mandate hasn’t been in effect for about two years. But $10,000 — the hefty amount this family was supposedly penalized for not having health insurance — raised questions for us. And was that money really used to pay for other people’s health insurance? We decided to look into it. The ACA was implemented in 2010 during the Obama administration. The aim of the health care law — often referred to as Obamacare — was to ensure everyone had health insurance. To that end, the law used what health policy experts call a ""carrot-and-stick"" approach. For low-income and middle-income individuals who had difficulty affording health insurance, the government would provide tax subsidies to reduce the cost of insurance — that was the carrot. And to make sure everyone enrolled in a health insurance plan, those who didn’t sign up were fined, under what was known as the individual mandate provision. That was the stick. The individual mandate, which didn’t kick in until 2014, was unpopular with the American public, according to polling at the time. A 2017 KFF poll showed that 55% of Americans supported the idea of eliminating the requirement that everyone must have health insurance or pay a fine. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) Although one of Trump’s key campaign promises was to repeal and replace the ACA, efforts to do so failed in 2017 when the Republican-held Senate failed to get the votes it needed. Instead, in their 2017 tax bill, Republicans set the penalty for the individual mandate to $0. Starting in 2019, Americans no longer had to pay a fine for not having health insurance. Trump signed the 2017 tax bill into law. So, it is true that Trump and congressional Republicans were responsible for neutralizing the penalty. However, experts pointed out that the individual mandate is still in place, it’s just that the penalty is set to $0. In fact, the end of the penalty is behind the justification for a court case attempting to overturn the ACA, brought by Republican attorneys general and supported by the Trump administration. The plaintiffs argue that the health care law is no longer constitutional because the penalty no longer ""produces at least some revenue"" for the federal government. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the case Nov. 10. The viral social media posts claim that the family ""couldn’t afford health insurance"" and was penalized $10,000. Health policy experts told us that while the social media post doesn’t give all the specifics needed to know if this was absolutely true, it seems unlikely a penalty would be this high. One issue is the post doesn’t specify whether the $10,000 penalty was incurred in one year or over multiple years. It also doesn’t say how many individuals were part of the family. Assuming the $10,000 penalty was incurred in one year, multiple experts told us that the family would have had an annual income above $400,000 and at least one person would have had to be uninsured for the entire year. That math is based on the penalty structure in place in 2018, the last year the mandate was enforced. In 2018, the penalty was calculated one of two ways. The fine was the greater of the two results: The first way to calculate the penalty obviously doesn’t apply since the max was $2,085 per year. So, the second would be the only way to get a $10,000-a-year penalty. To arrive at such a number, you would have to take 2.5% of the family’s income. In this case, 2.5% of a $400,000 income gets you close to $10,000. And experts said it is highly unlikely that a family with a $400,000 income would have had difficulty affording health insurance. ""So I would highly doubt the veracity of what is written on that car windshield,"" Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow in health reform and private insurance at KFF wrote in an email. ""People with that much income almost always have job-based health benefits and, if not, generally are inclined to insure themselves very well in order to protect assets — otherwise, if hospitalized and uninsured, they could owe many multiples of the penalty amount in medical bills."" Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, also pointed out that a $10,000 penalty would have been rare. ""Very few American families would have paid anything close to that amount in penalty for not having insurance — the average penalty per person in 2017 was around $700,"" Oberlander wrote in an email. ""Moreover, only a small percentage of Americans ever paid the penalty for not having health insurance — in 2017, 4.6 million persons,"" or about 1% of the population. (In 2017, 325 million people lived in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau.) It’s also unclear whether it would have just been cheaper for the family to pay for health insurance rather than incur a $10,000 penalty, said Matthew Fiedler, a health policy scholar at the Brookings Institution. ""It depends on the ages of the members of the family, where they live, what year (or years) we are talking about, and the family’s income,"" Fiedler wrote in an email. ""There are conceivable scenarios where the family could have found a bronze plan for $10k or less. But there are also plenty of plausible scenarios where they could not have. Without knowing more about the family’s circumstances, it’s just hard to say with any confidence."" Experts also told us that the post’s assertion that the penalties paid for not having health insurance were directly applied to fund other people’s health insurance was off the mark. The individual mandate penalties were assessed during each annual tax filing, and then payments were made the year after there was a lapse in insurance coverage. Those penalties were collected just like any other tax payment. ""As a strict accounting, keep in mind, everything gets dumped into the Treasury regardless of the source, and then it is appropriated out of the Treasury by Congress,"" said Edmund Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health care policy at the Heritage Foundation. ""It’s not like money goes into one account and then another."" So, while it’s certainly possible that the penalty money could have been used to help pay for some of the ACA subsidies for other people, the money also could have gone to any other number of things the government pays for, like the military, disaster relief or education. ""You don’t know exactly where your taxes or penalties go,"" said Evan Saltzman, an assistant professor in economics at Emory University. ""Maybe a small share went to Obamacare, but that’s a stretch. You can’t track where every dollar you spent on your taxes is going."" It’s also misleading to say that other individuals received ""free Obamacare"" from the penalty payment. The experts said that while Medicaid expansion, which was a part of the ACA, does provide health care coverage for low-income people who are eligible, those who bought insurance on the marketplace would still likely have paid for some part of their coverage after subsidies were applied. A viral social media post claims that a family was penalized $10,000 for not being able to afford health insurance. It also claimed the penalty money was taken to pay for others’ ""free ObamaCare"" and Trump stopped that practice. It is true that Trump and Congress did zero out the individual mandate requirement, so people could no longer be penalized for not having health insurance. But after that, skepticism abounds. For instance, it’s very unlikely that a family would face a $10,000 penalty in one year. Moreover, if such a family did face this penalty for not having health insurance, they would likely be in a high-income bracket for which health insurance tends to come from an employer or be affordable. And the charge that the penalty was used to provide ""free coverage"" for others doesn’t fit with federal accounting processes. Experts said, though, that the lack of specifics about this family’s situation makes it difficult to be completely definitive. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/oct/28/facebook-posts/10000-obamacare-penalty-doubtful/
