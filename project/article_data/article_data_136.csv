CIA documents say Speaker Pelosi was told about enhanced interrogation techniques
","
Republicans who oppose efforts to pursue legal action against government lawyers who signed off on waterboarding and other controversial interrogation techniques used after 9/11 have settled on a high-profile target: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
 
In the latest game of ""What did she know and when?"" Republicans claim Democrats' outrage is hypocritical because Pelosi and other Democrats were briefed on waterboarding and other ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" back in 2002 and 2003 and did not raise objections.
 
In an April 23, 2009, news conference, Pelosi was asked if, during the fall of 2002, she and other key members of the intelligence committee were briefed on interrogation methods, including waterboarding.
 
Pelosi said that on only one occasion had she received a CIA briefing on interrogation techniques, but that ""we were not, I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel — the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would.""


""Further,"" she said, ""the point was that if and when they would be used, they could brief Congress at that time. ... My experience was they did not tell us they were using that, flat out. And any contention to the contrary is simply not true.""
 
But her comments are directly contradicted by a CIA timeline prepared by the director of national intelligence that indicates that Pelosi and Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., then-chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, were briefed on enhanced interrogation techniques.
 
Specifically, the CIA timeline states that on Sept. 4, 2002, Pelosi and Goss received a ""Briefing on EITs (enhanced interrogation techniques) including use of EITs on (alleged al-Qaida operative) Abu Zubaydah, background on authorities, and a description of the particular EITs that had been employed.""
 
That briefing came a month after the CIA began using Justice Department-approved enhanced interrogation techniques — including the drowning simulation technique known as waterboarding — on Abu Zubaydah, according to a Justice Department memo released in March 2009.
 
The CIA version is backed up by Goss, who resigned from Congress in 2004 to become CIA director under President George W. Bush, a post Goss held until 2006.
 
In an April 25, 2009, commentary for the

Washington Post,

Goss said ""a disturbing epidemic of amnesia seems to be plaguing my former colleagues on Capitol Hill."" Goss said he was ""slack-jawed to read that members claim to have not understood that the techniques on which they were briefed were to actually be employed; or that specific techniques such as 'waterboarding' were never mentioned.""
 
""Let me be clear,"" Goss wrote, ""It is my recollection that: The chairs and the ranking minority members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, known as the Gang of Four (including Pelosi), were briefed that the CIA was holding and interrogating high-value terrorists; we understood what the CIA was doing; we gave the CIA our bipartisan support; we gave the CIA funding to carry out its activities.""
 
Pelosi has been adamant that her briefing was not about interrogation techniques that had been done in the past or present, but only were under consideration for the future.
 
""They can say whatever they want, but the fact is they did not brief us in that regard,"" Pelosi said.
 
The timeline — and Goss' corroboration — contradicts her, although we should add one caveat about specific discussions of waterboarding.
 
Although Goss says waterboarding was part of the discussion, there's nothing in the CIA timeline that states it was specifically discussed in the briefing Pelosi attended. So if we stick strictly to public documents released so far, there's no conclusive evidence that Pelosi was briefed on waterboarding. However, waterboarding

was

specifically mentioned elsewhere in the timeline for briefings for other members of the intelligence committee who presumably would be covered by her reference to ""we.""
 
The timeline says waterboarding was mentioned in a Feb. 4, 2003, briefing with Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., during which, according to the CIA data, enhanced interrogation techniques were ""described in considerable detail,"" including ""how the water board was used."" Roberts was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time, and Rockefeller was ranking Democrat.
 
Jamie Smith, a Rockefeller spokeswoman, told the

Chicago Tribune

""Sen. Rockefeller was briefed but was not presented with the full picture, nor was he told critical information that would have cast significant doubt on the program's legality and effectiveness.""
 
In a May 5, 2009, memo submitted with the timeline, CIA director Leon Panetta acknowledged the differing accounts of the meeting that Pelosi and Goss attended. But he said the CIA's version is based in part on records created at the time of the meeting.
 
""This letter presents the most thorough information we have on dates, locations, and names of all members of Congress who were briefed by the CIA on enhanced interrogation techniques,"" Panetta stated in his letter to Rep. Silvestre Reyes, chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. ""This information, however, is drawn from the past files of the CIA and represents MFRs (memorandums for the record) completed at the time and notes that summarized the best recollections of those individuals. In the end, you and the committee will have to determine whether this information is an accurate summary of what actually happened.""
 
At PolitiFact, we normally would be reluctant to make a Truth-O-Meter ruling in a he-said, she-said situation, but in this case, the evidence goes beyond the competing accounts from Pelosi and Goss. We are persuaded by the CIA timeline, which the agency says is based on ""an extensive review of (the CIA's) electronic and hard copy files.""
 
It's also important to note that the timeline that contradicts Pelosi was put together at the behest of an administration controlled by her own party. That document provides compelling — albeit sparsely worded — evidence that Pelosi's recollection is incorrect. There may be further evidence on this that emerges in the future. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has asked director of national intelligence Dennis Blair and CIA director Leon Panetta to release the CIA briefing notes that the timeline is based on. We reserve the right to change our ruling if new information emerges that contradicts the CIA timeline, but for now, we rule Pelosi's statement False.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Stimulus', ""Conservatives for Patients' Rights""]","
Health board in the stimulus bill not meant to imitate Britain
","A television ad makes the argument that the United States is on the path to a nationalized health service similar to the United Kingdom's. The advocacy group Conservatives for Patients' Rights created the ad, which features the group's chairman, Rick Scott, talking about the economic stimulus bill that became law Feb. 17, 2009. Scott is a health care executive who founded Solantic, a chain of urgent care clinics in Florida. ""Deep inside the stimulus bill Congress buried an innocent-sounding board, the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research,"" Scott says in the ad. ""It's not so innocent. It's the first step in government control over your health care choices. This federal council is modeled after the national board that controls Britain's health system."" The ad goes on to quote doctors who complain about lack of choice and long waiting times for care in the national health care systems of Britain and Canada. ""Not only could a government board deny your choice in doctors but it can control life and death for some patients,"" Scott says. ""Tell Congress you won't trade your doctor for a national board of bureaucrats. Let's put patients first,"" he concludes. The ad is correct that the stimulus bill includes language creating the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. But to say it's modeled after the British health system is wrong. The board is simply an effort to pull together disparate federal agencies to find the best health treatments. Comparative effectiveness research is an effort in health care to determine which treatments work best. The new board's goal, according to the bill's conference report, is to ""reduce duplication of comparative effectiveness research activities within the federal government."" The legislation requires that half of the board's 15 members be physicians or ""other experts with clinical expertise."" The legislation also specifically states it does not permit the board to ""mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer"" and that the none of the board's reports or recommendations ""shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment, coverage, or treatment."" This stands in sharp contrast to the British system, where government entities run the health care system and a national board, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence, determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. In defending its ad, the group has said that its ad makes clear that the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research is simply a ""first step"" toward the British system. But that seems to be the group's opinion more than a fact. There are relatively few supporters for a government-run health care system in Congress, though Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, both Democrats, support similar models known as single-payer health systems.  President Barack Obama has specifically rejected a government-run health care system in the style of Britain or Canada, even though some of his supporters have asked him to consider it as an option. He addressed the matter most directly during a town hall on March 26, 2009, where people submitted questions via the Internet, including, ""Why can we not have a universal health care system, like many European countries, where people are treated based on needs rather than financial resources?"" Obama said that the British and Canadian systems are too different from what exists in the United States, where the majority of people get health care coverage through their employers. (Read his extended answer via  the White House transcript  .) ""I don't think the best way to fix our health care system is to suddenly completely scrap what everybody is accustomed to and the vast majority of people already have. Rather, what I think we should do is to build on the system that we have and fill some of these gaps,"" he concluded. He also added that he hoped to ""lower costs through reforms in how we reimburse doctors so that they're not getting paid just for the number of operations they're doing, but for whether they're quality outcomes."" That seems how a board like the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research would make an impact under Obama's plan. We can't say for sure, though, because Obama and Congress have yet to reveal the full details of health care reform. This is not to say that implementing comparative effectiveness research will be painless for the public, and Obama has admitted as much. In an interview with the  New York Times  on April 14, 2009, he discussed his grandmother's decision to get a hip replacement even though she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and died soon after the replacement. ""I would have paid out of pocket for that hip replacement just because she’s my grandmother,"" Obama said. ""Whether, sort of in the aggregate, society making those decisions to give my grandmother, or everybody else’s aging grandparents or parents, a hip replacement when they’re terminally ill is a sustainable model, is a very difficult question."" Obama added that answering tough questions on end-of-life care will ""have to be a conversation that is guided by doctors, scientists, ethicists. And then there is going to have to be a very difficult democratic conversation that takes place. It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels. And that’s part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It’s not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance."" Getting back to the ad: It is right that the economic stimulus bill created the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. But the ad is wrong that it is ""modeled after the national board that controls Britain’s health system."" We see no evidence for that. In fact, the president has specifically rejected the British model, while praising comparative effectiveness research as an acceptable way to rein in spending. Because the ad significantly distorts the reason for the board's existence, we rate its claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976A9700>],/factchecks/2009/may/11/conservatives-patients-rights/health-board-stimulus-bill-not-meant-imitate-brita/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Chain email']","
Money for humanitarian aid, not emigration assistance
","
Claims in chain e-mails we are asked to check have so often proved to be ridiculously and maliciously false, we wonder who takes these things seriously anymore.
 
In this case, the answer seems to be be ... a U.S. senator.
 
First, the chain e-mail. Our readers have sent us several versions, but they all begin with typical chain e-mail boilerplate (at least the conservative variety), beginning with the suggestion that President Barack Obama is actually a Muslim and that Congress has recently passed something ""behind our backs."" (To see one version, click

here

.)
 
Then the meat: ""Obama funds $20M in tax payer dollars to emmigrate (sic) Hamas Refugees to the USA. This is the news that didn't make the headlines...


""By executive order, President Barack Obama has ordered the expenditure of $20.3 million in 'migration assistance' to the Palestinian refugees and 'conflict victims' in Gaza.


 ""The 'Presidential Determination', allows hundreds of thousands of 'Hamas' Palestinians to resettle in the United States and was signed on January 27, 2009 and appeared in the Federal Register on February 4.


 ""Few on Capitol Hill, or in the media, took note that the order provides a free airline ticket, replete with housing and food allowances, to individuals who have given their overwhelming support to the Islamic Resistance (Hamas) in the parliamentary election of Jan, 2006.""
 
Most of this appears to be lifted from a Feb. 7, 2009, article written by Dr. Paul L. Williams for The New Media Journal, a conservative Web site.
 
Helpfully, some of the e-mails include a link to ""Presidential Determination No. 2009-15 of January 27, 2009,"" a memo from Obama to the Secretary of State on ""Unexpected Urgent Refugee and Migration Needs Related To Gaza.""
 
The memo — which is legitimate — states that ""it is important to the national interest to furnish assistance under the (Migration and Refugee Assistance) Act in an amount not to exceed $20.3 million from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund for the purpose of meeting unexpected and urgent refugee and migration needs, including by contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations and payment of administrative expenses of Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State, related to humanitarian needs of Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza.""
 
We can understand how someone could misinterpret the ""migration needs"" language in the memo.
 
But a news release from the State Department on Jan. 30 makes it all very clear. It provides a breakdown on the distribution of the funds and shows the money does not got for plane tickets for ""Hamas"" Palestinians to resettle in the United States:
 
""$13.5 million will go to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), $6 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and $800,000 to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). These organizations are distributing emergency food assistance, providing medical assistance and temporary shelter, creating temporary employment, and restoring access to electricity and potable water to the people of Gaza.""
 
And, the release notes, the contribution to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency supplemented $85 million the U.S. contributed in December 2008 (under President George W. Bush).
 
And it says the money was used in the Middle East. ""Of that amount, $25 million supported UNRWA emergency operations in West Bank and Gaza,"" the release notes. ""The remaining $60 million supported UNRWA’s services for 4.6 million Palestinian refugees in the region, including Gaza. UNRWA is the largest provider of humanitarian aid in Gaza, providing 70 percent of the population with emergency food assistance, essential healthcare, and primary education.""
 
At this point, we'd like to tip our cap to our fellow fact-checkers over at Snopes.com, who first knocked down these false e-mail claims with an item posted on Feb. 17, 2009. Two days later, on Feb. 19, 2009, FactCheck.org debunked it as well. We note the dates, because two weeks later, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., the Senate minority whip, offered an amendment to the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, a ""prohibition on the use of funds in this bill for resettlement into the United States of Palestinians from Gaza.""
 
Explained Kyl: ""There has been a suggestion that perhaps that might be permitted, and we simply want to make it clear that will not be permitted with any funds in this bill.""
 
Three days later, several senators objected on the floor of the Senate.
 
""Frankly, it is unnecessary and for the United States, a nation of immigrants, it goes against everything we stand for,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ""We don’t resettle anybody from Gaza, nor do we resettle anybody from Gaza who is living in the U.N. refugee camps in the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan. The amendment is a solution looking for a problem. If a Palestinian from Gaza gets to a place like Italy, or somewhere in Europe, the amendment would prevent the State Department from even considering that person for resettlement to the United States. We would have to tell them 'Sorry, you can’t come in, because you are from a place that has terrorists.'""
 
Kyl defended the amendment by saying ""it was a response to a news story which gained a great deal of attention from my constituents related to the January 30 order by the President, ordering $20 million for urgent relief efforts to provide migration assistance to Palestinian refugees. That has gotten a lot of attention from folks. They wanted to know what we were doing.""
 
Again, the only source we found for this claim was a story in The New Media Journal, which our friends at FactCheck.org noted has posted stories comparing Obama to Hitler and calling Islam ""a pathological doctrine and a vestige of long ago barbarism.""  We called Kyl's office to get more details about his knowledge of the e-mail but did not hear back.
 
Kyl was right that it gained a lot of attention. We found it posted on lots of conservative Web sites like NoBamaNation, AntiObama.net and Patriots for America.
 
Nevertheless, the following day, Kyl withdrew the amendment after receiving a letter from the Department of State, which he entered into the Senate record.
 
The letter, from Michael C. Polt, acting assistant secretary of state, states that the $20.3 million drawn from the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund (ERMA) ""will be used to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza. None of these funds will be used to resettle Gazans in the United States.""
 
And yet, the chain e-mails live on. Like so many chain e-mails we are asked to check, we throw this one on the Pants on Fire heap.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Chain email']","
One of Obama's first calls was to Palestinian leader, and Israeli leader
 ","
A recent chain e-mail claiming President Barack Obama directed $20.3 million to allow ""hundreds of thousands of 'Hamas' Palestinians to resettle in the United States"" (which we found was Pants on Fire wrong) includes a common refrain of chain e-mails that Obama is a Muslim (one we've checked before and found was False), plus a new twist. It said that after Obama's inauguration, ""His first call to any head of state, as president, was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory.""
 
We checked the accounts of Obama's first day and found some truth to the claim. According to a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, on the morning of Obama's first full day in office, Jan. 21, 2009, the president placed brief phone calls to four Middle Eastern leaders — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Jordan's King Abdullah and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
 
""He used this opportunity on his first day in office to communicate his commitment to active engagement in pursuit of Arab-Israeli peace from the beginning of his term, and to express his hope for their continued cooperation and leadership,"" Gibbs said in the statement. ""In the aftermath of the Gaza conflict, he emphasized his determination to work to help consolidate the ceasefire by establishing an effective anti-smuggling regime to prevent Hamas from rearming, and facilitating in partnership with the Palestinian Authority a major reconstruction effort for Palestinians in Gaza. He pledged that the United States would do its part to make these efforts successful, working closely with the international community and these partners as they fulfill their responsibilities as well.  The President appreciated the spirit of partnership and warm nature of these calls.""
 
Palestinian officials on the West Bank bragged that Obama called Abbas first.
 
According to a story in Agence France Presse on Jan. 21, 2009, Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina quoted Obama as saying, ""This is my first phone call to a foreign leader and I'm making it only hours after I took office.""
 
The spokesman said Obama vowed ""to work with him (Abbas) as partners to establish a durable peace in the region"" and that he (Obama) ""would deploy every possible effort to achieve peace as quickly as possible.""
 
The New York

Daily News

wrote a story about the slippery diplomatic slope that comes along with things as small as who got called first. The story quotes a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy in Washington as saying his government had ""no idea"" who Obama called first; and that the White House was mum on the issue. We also got no response from the White House on the matter.
 
But we think the issue of who got called minutes before someone else is irrelevant. The point is that Obama's first calls were to leaders of this region — all of them. The e-mail may be right that Obama called Abbas first. At the very least, Abbas was among the very first. But consider the context in which the statement was made, to back up the suggestion that Obama is actually a Muslim. Assuming Obama did call Abbas first — and again, we can't confirm that — we do know that one of his very next calls was to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. The e-mail conveniently leaves that detail out.
 
Here at PolitiFact, we define a Half True statement as one that is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We think this claim fits the bill. Half True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama exaggerates role of ""pay as you go"" in balancing federal budget
","
President Barack Obama has been singing the praises of ""pay as you go,"" a budget approach that is supposed to force lawmakers to offset new spending with an equal amount of revenue or budget cuts.
 
In his April 25, 2009, radio and video address, Obama said, ""We need to adhere to the basic principle that new tax or entitlement policies should be paid for. This principle— known as PAYGO — helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s. Now, we must restore that sense of fiscal discipline.""
 
He repeated the claim on May 7, 2009, in a speech at the White House when he unveiled the details of 2010 budget.
 
""One important step is restoring the ""pay as you go"" rule — and I've called on Congress to do exactly that,"" he said. ""This rule says, very simply, that Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar elsewhere.  This is the principle that guides responsible families managing a budget.  This is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s.""
 
We wondered if he was correct about PAYGO's role in balancing the federal budget in the 1990s.
 
We found that Obama is correct that Congress operated under a PAYGO law that was in effect from 1990 until it expired in 2002. When the Democrats took control of Congress after the 2006 elections, they established a PAYGO rule, but it has been waived for some of the most expensive bills, such as the economic stimulus bill. Fiscal hawks are urging Congress to replace that rule with a new law that would have more impact and be more binding.
 
Obama is also right, of course, that the federal budget was balanced by 1998 and ran four years of surpluses before plunging back into deficit. The question is how much to credit PAYGO for those surpluses.
 
To find the answer, we interviewed budget analysts and examined reports on the deficit and the impact of PAYGO. We found a general consensus that PAYGO was a factor that reduced the deficit, but most said it was not as important as the two biggest forces that led to a balanced budget— the increase in tax receipts from the booming economy and defense cuts made possible by the end of the Cold War.
 
Still, there was a range of opinion on how much the rule helped.
 
Alice Rivlin, budget chief under President Bill Clinton, characterized PAYGO as a significant factor. She said in a recent interview on PBS's

Frontline

that PAYGO and other budget rules ""made it easier for the Clinton administration to work on the budget deficit."" 
 
She said the PAYGO rule provided discipline so policymakers could resist tempting but expensive programs. The rule ""meant that the president could say no, and the Congress could say no to a lot of good-sounding ideas, including Medicare prescription drugs"" that would have made it difficult to balance the budget.
 
That's backed up by a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that said, ""Between 1991 and 1997, most new revenue and mandatory spending laws that were enacted were consistent with the PAYGO requirement to be deficit neutral; end-of-session balances on the PAYGO scorecard consistently showed zero or net reductions in the deficit.""
 
Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility and was founded in the midst of the PAYGO movement in 1992, said PAYGO provided some important discipline for members of Congress even if it was not as big a factor as the booming economy and the defense cuts. ""There always needs to be a check on irresponsibility in Congress and PAYGO provides that,"" he said.
 

 
But Brian Riedl, a budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said PAYGO's importance has been exaggerated. ""There is this grand myth that we passed PAYGO and then we got this balanced budget. But we got the balanced budget because the Cold War ended and a bubble temporarily pushed revenues through the roof.""
 

 
He said that PAYGO didn't provide as much discipline as some claim because Congress repeatedly used gimmicks or took steps to ignore it.
 
So back to Obama's claim. He said the PAYGO ""is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s."" He is correct that it is a basic principle behind the effort to balance the budget, but his statement leaves the impression that it was the biggest factor. It wasn't.
 
Yes, PAYGO rules provided some discipline that might have restrained Congress from adding more spending or new tax cuts, but the economy and the defense cuts were the biggest factors that led to the balanced budget. So we find his statement Half True.

Republican Party identification is shrinking
","
Democrats are still celebrating over Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch from Republican to Democrat — and are mocking the Republicans about it.
 
Their latest Web ad is a spoof of the television show

Survivor

, showing a parade of Republican leaders and asking, ""Which one will win the battle for the heart and soul of the GOP?""
 
The ad was inspired by an op-ed that Republican moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine wrote for the

New York Times,

lamenting what she sees as the Republican Party's hostile attitude to moderates.
 
""It is true that being a Republican moderate sometimes feels like being a cast member of

Survivor

— you are presented with multiple challenges, and you often get the distinct feeling that you’re no longer welcome in the tribe,"" Snowe wrote. ""But it is truly a dangerous signal that a Republican senator of nearly three decades no longer felt able to remain in the party.""
 
The DNC's ad starts with that quote, then shows a parade of Republican leaders identified by their first names. There's Mitt (Romney, former governor of Massachusetts); John B. (John Boehner, the House minority leader); Sarah (Palin, the governor of Alaska); Karl (Rove, political adviser to George W. Bush) and more. The ad concludes with Rush Limbaugh.
 
The video is really just an effort to mock Republican leaders. But one checkable fact stood out to us: ""21 percent party ID and shrinking,"" meaning that the GOP now has only 21 percent of the electorate, and that figure is declining.
 
To find out the facts, we have to turn to polls for how people cited their party because some states don't require voters to declare an affiliation.
 
Two nonpartisan polling organizations, the Gallup Polls and Pew Research Center for People and the Press, released polling data on party identification close to the same time the DNC ad was released. Gallup found 28 percent identified as Republicans, while Pew counted it at 23 percent.
 
To broaden the picture, we turned to the Web site Pollster.com The site creates data models that aggregate many polls, with an eye toward more accurate results. The site lists an NBC poll at 20 percent and one from the Associated Press at 18 percent, but most are above the 21 percent cited by the Democrats. Using the range numbers, Pollster.com calculated an overall estimate of 26.4 percent.
 
So the Democrats are cherry-picking the low end.
 
The next question is whether Republican registrations are declining. The ad doesn't give a time frame.
 
Both the Gallup and Pew polls show declines since roughly 2005. Gallup has recorded a decline in Republican Party identification from about 35 percent in 2005 to 28 percent in 2009. Pew showed a decline from 30 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2009.
 
During similar time frames, Democrats have seen small upticks or been flat. Pew showed independents increasing from 30 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2009.
 
So the DNC is right that the number of voters identifying themselves as Republicans has been declining. But 21 percent is from the low end of accepted estimates. So we rate their statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'Pundits', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Rush is right about Judiciary Committee rules
","Rush Limbaugh speculated recently that Sen. Arlen Specter's switch to the Democratic Party wouldn't necessarily be a boon to Democrats when it comes time for Supreme Court nominations. ""The conventional wisdom was that Arlen Specter defecting to the Democrats put them close to a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate which would allow Obama to just skate through his agenda,"" Limbaugh said on his radio show May 1. ""And on most subjects, it appears to be true. However, Specter's defection may actually end up giving Republicans the ability to filibuster judicial nominees at the Judiciary Committee level so that the nominees never get out of committee. Now, these are big 'if's, but it's possible."" Limbaugh cited a legal blog,  Dorf on Law  , as his source on the matter. Law professor Michael Dorf wrote that the Senate Judiciary Committee has a rule that one member of the minority party must agree for a matter to be brought to a vote. Otherwise the matter will not be voted on. Dorf is a law professor at Cornell University and a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. We confirmed the Senate Judiciary Committee's rule that the blog cited. Rule IV states, ""The Chairman shall entertain a non-debatable motion to bring a matter before the Committee to a vote. If there is objection to bring the matter to a vote without further debate, a roll call vote of the Committee shall be taken, and debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter to a vote without further debate passes with ten votes in the affirmative, one of which must be cast by the minority."" We should note that this is not a filibuster, which is a tactic used on the Senate floor to prevent a vote by refusing to stop debating. It was immortalized in the movie  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,  in which Jimmy Stewart portrays a senator who filibusters to save his reputation. He eventually  collapses in exhaustion  . These days, the threat of filibuster is usually enough to stop legislation on the Senate floor until supporters can muster the 60 votes needed to overcome it. But Rule IV is a way of refusing to allow a measure to get a committee vote. Typically, though, there has been great reluctance to bottle up nominations like this. A Senate staff member referred us to a 2001 letter signed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy and then senior Republican Orrin Hatch. (Leahy is still chairman; the new top GOP member is Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.) The letter states, ""The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the Committee has completed its consideration. This has been true even in cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed by a majority of the Judiciary Committee. We both recognize and have every intention of following the practices and precedents of the Committee and the Senate when considering Supreme Court nominees."" Limbaugh conceded that using Rule IV would be controversial. ""Now, folks, admittedly this is a bit of a long shot because this is going to require that the Republicans have the fortitude to even do this, to even try it; 'cause if they did — if they essentially filibustered the vote in the Judiciary Committee — the media is going to be all over these things,"" he said. ""I mean, nuclear ammo is gonna rain down on these guys if they try it. But it's possible."" But we wondered if using this Rule IV would be the end of the story. To find out, we turned to one of the Senate's official historians, Donald Ritchie. He said that both the House and the Senate have rules that allow them to pull matters out of committee, even when the committee refuses to vote on a measure. The rules usually require that the matter lay over for one day, but then the body can take up the matter that the committee failed to address. ""It's not 100 percent on either side. It's not easy for the majority, but it's not impossible either,"" he said. ""Nothing is easy in the Senate. I don't make any predictions."" It's also important to note that a nominee can get a failing vote from a committee, and then still be approved by the full Senate. A prominent example of this is when President Franklin Roosevelt nominated Henry Wallace to be secretary of commerce in 1945. The Senate committee voted against the nomination, but the full Senate then voted on the matter and approved his nomination, Ritchie said. Limbaugh is right about the existence of the committee rule and its potential effects. He admits it's a longshot. But it's not a filibuster in committee in the way that the rule works. And unlike the classic filibuster, the Rule IV move could likely be overcome by the full Senate. But at its core, Limbaugh is right it's a possible maneuver for the Republican minority. We rule Limbaugh's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972CDEC0>],/factchecks/2009/may/05/rush-limbaugh/rush-right-about-judiciary-committee-rules/

Sunstein has said people ought to be able to sue on behalf of abused animals
","
At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Feb. 27, 2009, the National Rifle Association's fiery Wayne LaPierre teed off on one of President Barack Obama's lesser-known appointees.
 
The target: Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor who was tapped to head up the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a position better known as the administration's regulatory czar.
 
LaPierre opened with a zinger: ""Sunstein is a radical animal rights extremist who makes PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) look like cheerleaders with pooper-scoopers.""
 
How extreme? LaPierre said Sunstein is ""a man who wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat.""
 
LaPierre isn't alone in making similar claims. Go to the self-explanatory Web site StopSunstein.com, sponsored by the American Conservative Union, and you'll find this quote from one of Sunstein's books: ""Animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives …""
 
The quote comes from Sunstein's 2004 book

Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions

. We call your attention to Chapter 11, titled ""Can Animals Sue?"" Sunstein argues that there are already plenty of animal cruelty laws on the books that just aren't enforced.
 
""My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law. I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law.""
 
In a speech at Harvard in 2007, Sunstein argued there is ""a real gap"" in the laws governing animal cruelty laws, essentially that prosecutors have a monopoly in making sure those laws are followed. ""The law should be changed to give affected persons, interested persons, those who have some sort of connection with the animal, a right to sue either for damages or for an injunction to get that violation of what is standard already in law to stop.""
 
That Sunstein is an animal rights activist is undisputed. For a CNN interview in the late 1990s, he once insisted on being joined on-air by his dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Perry. And LaPierre is correct when he says that Sunstein has talked about allowing animals to sue — albeit through a human representative. But we think LaPierre has twisted Sunstein's words. Sunstein wasn't saying you — the meat eater — could be sued by Porky Pig for eating bacon. But he was saying that if the pig that winds up on your breakfast plate was raised or killed in a way that violates existing animal cruelty laws, then someone ought to be able to sue the processor on the pig's behalf. That's all, folks.
 
We rate LaPierre's statement Half True.

"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'Technology', 'Chain email']","
Cass Sunstein once considered a ""Fairness Doctrine"" of sorts for the Internet, but then thought better of it
","
A PolitiFact reader sent us a chain e-mail that claims that President Barack Obama's nominee to be the administration's regulatory czar once advocated a ""Fairness Doctrine"" of sorts for the Internet, one that would require partisan sites to link to sites with opposing viewpoints.
 
We're talking here about Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor, who was tapped to head up the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
 
First off, let's peel back the onion a bit on this chain e-mail. It originates from an article on the conservative news site World Net Daily about comments on Sunstein by Brad O'Leary, author of the book

Shut Up, America! The End of Free Speech.

 


Said O'Leary: ""It's hard to imagine President Obama nominating a more dangerous candidate for regulatory czar than Cass Sunstein. Not only is Sunstein an animal-rights radical, but he also seems to have a serious problem with our First Amendment rights. Sunstein has advocated everything from regulating the content of personal e-mail communications, to forcing nonprofit groups to publish information on their Web sites that is counter to their beliefs and mission. Of course, none of this should be surprising from a man who has said that 'limitless individual choices, with respect to communications, is not necessarily in the interest of citizenship and self-government.' If it were up to Obama and Sunstein, everything we read online — right down to our personal e-mail communications — would have to be inspected and approved by the federal government.""
 
To explore whether the claim is true, we went back to Sunstein's 2002 book,

Republic.com

. In it, Sunstein discusses the drawbacks of limitless choices on the Internet that allow people to seek out only like-minded people and opinions that merely fortify their own views, creating an echo chamber that Sunstein argued is bad for democracy. In the book, Sunstein talks about the idea of the government requiring sites to link to opposing views.
 
In a later edition of the book released in 2007,

Republic.com 2.0

, Sunstein tempers that position, advocating instead for the creation of public spaces on the Internet where people with differing viewpoints could share their ideas with one another.
 
But in a video interview on the Web site Bloggerheads.tv on Feb. 29, 2008, Sunstein actually goes a little bit farther than that, calling it a ""bad idea"" he should never have ventured.
 
Asked to explain some of the differences between the first book, what Sunstein called ""the initial inadequate edition,"" and its successor, Sunstein said, ""To me, the most important (difference) is that the first

Republic.com

was full of some bad policy recommendations and I was able to get rid of those. So I feel the book has been corrected.""


""The initial book was interested in at least considering some government mandates that would require people to link to opposing views, that would require some attention to arguments that maybe had been neglected,"" Sunstein said. ""And while the book

Republic.com

was pretty tentative about that, to be tentative about a bad idea, it's probably better not to even venture a bad idea. Some of the bad ideas I ventured tentatively as worth considering in

Republic.com

, in

2.0

I say they'd be bad ideas and they'd be unconstitutional.""
 
The World Net Daily story notes that Sunstein ""rethought"" the proposal as ""too difficult to regulate"" and ""almost certainly unconstitutional,"" but that caveat is made later in the article and is overshadowed by the headline, which says ""U.S. regulatory czar nominee wants Net 'Fairness Doctrine.'""
 
Yes, Sunstein acknowledges this was an idea he once threw out there — albeit, in his words, ""tentatively."" But he now thinks it's a bad idea. So the chain e-mail/article is correct that Sunstein once suggested it. But contrary to the headline, it's a position he no longer holds, as he has since said strongly and repeatedly. Once true. No longer. That leaves us at Half True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Transportation', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden wrong on the way germs travel through an aircraft
","Vice President Joe Biden went on the  Today  show on April 30, 2009, to quell concern about swine flu. But he didn't quite stay on message.  Interviewer Matt Lauer began by asking Biden why the federal government wasn't closing the border between the United States and Mexico, where the outbreak began. ""We have contacted and been in constant contact with the leading health experts both in the world as well as here in the United States, and they have suggested that that is not the way we should move,"" Biden told Lauer. Lauer pressed Biden further on closing borders, saying, ""Let me ask this, and this is by no means a gotcha type of question, I promise. But if a member of your family came to you ..."" — Biden laughs here — ""No, Mr. Vice President, if a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?"" Biden: ""I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me. I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway. So from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing."" That ended Lauer's flu questions. (His other questions were about the economy, Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch, and why Biden wasn't included among members of Obama's team named to  People  magazine's list of most beautiful people.) Within hours, Biden's spokesman sent out a statement: ""On the  Today Show  this morning the vice president was asked what he would tell a family member who was considering air travel to Mexico this week. The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico. If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week. As the president said just last night, every American should take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick; and keep your children home from school if they're sick."" We were most curious about Biden's statement that germs spread like crazy inside an airplane cabin. The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true. ""Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,"" said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. ""The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well. The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings."" We wanted to consult an independent scientist, though, so we turned to Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University. Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment. The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration. Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze ""might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,"" Overfelt said. ""They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said."" ""Quite a bit of research indicates that,"" he added. And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said. We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point: • A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to ""a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis."" • A 2003 study in the  New England Journal of Medicine  on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that patients who became infected on airplanes were ""clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft."" • A 2005 study in  The Lancet  concluded, ""The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk."" That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes. This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to — you guessed it — rubbing your eyes. ""If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles,"" Overfelt said. ""With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go. I wouldn't hesitate at all to get on an airplane."" If Biden had said people should be careful about touching contaminated surfaces, that would have been one thing. But his statement was ""When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft."" That's just wrong. And he made the statement in the context of a highly sensitive public health matter where it's important to give the public accurate information. For fanning the flames of fear without having the facts on his side, we rate his statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280978BFE80>],/factchecks/2009/may/04/joe-biden/biden-wrong-way-germs-travel-through-aircraft/

Specter's party change shows the Full Flop in its finest form
","
Yes, this one is a no-brainer. But we can't resist using our Flip-O-Meter to record such a complete reversal of position.
 
Arlen Specter, the senior senator from Pennsylvania, was a moderate Republican, and one of only three Republican senators to vote for the economic stimulus bill that passed in February 2009.
 
But many moderates in Pennsylvania have jumped ship. In the 2008 election, about 200,000 Pennsylvania Republicans became Democrats, many so they could vote in the hotly contested Democratic primary between Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton.
 
This meant that as Specter looked to re-election next year, his prospects for beating a more conservative challenger — Pat Toomey, a former congressman who headed the free-market, antitax Club for Growth — were looking pretty bad.
 
Yet Specter had ruled out switching parties, until ... Well, let's look at the evidence.
 

Specter, in an interview with

The Hill

on March 17, 2009:

 
""I'm staying a Republican because I think I have a more important role to play there,"" he said.
 
""I think each of the 41 Republican senators, in a sense — and I don’t want to overstate this — is a national asset,"" he said, ""because if one was gone, you'd only have 40, the Democrats would have 60, and they would control all of the mechanisms of government.""
 

Specter, in a news conference on April 28, 2009:

 
""In the course of the last several months since the stimulus vote, I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls, and have found that the prospects for winning the Republican primary are bleak. I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate ... . But I'm prepared today take on all comers — all comers — in a general election. And therefore, I have decided to be a candidate for re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary.""
 
Some of our rulings require a lot of time spent gathering evidence and a finely calibrated review of tricky points. Not this one, though. Like judges in an Olympic diving competition, we know a perfect move when we see it: Full Flop!

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Michele Bachmann']","
Michele Bachmann wrong that swine flu broke out under Carter
","
Michele Bachmann, a Republican member of Congress from Minnesota, is known for her controversial remarks. During the fall of 2008, she nearly lost her re-election campaign because she said Barack Obama ""may have anti-American views."" In a 2009 radio interview, she said incorrectly that six Muslim clerics who were removed from a US Airways flight in 2006 were attending a ""victory celebration"" for Keith Ellison, a Muslim who was elected to Congress.
 
So we weren't exactly surprised when we heard her suggest a link between Democratic presidents and the swine flu. Here's her comment, from an interview with Pajamas Media:
 
 ""I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president, Jimmy Carter. And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an interesting coincidence.""
 
Well, at least she's right about the decade. Yes, the last big swine flu scare occurred in the 1970s. But other than that, her statement is utterly false.
 
The scare began in February 1976 when recruits at Fort Dix, N.J., came down with flu symptoms, and one died. This led to fears of a pandemic. The president in 1976 was Gerald Ford — a Republican.
 
Ford, following the advice of public health officials, called for a nationwide vaccination program. In just 10 days, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. But three senior citizens died shortly after receiving their swine flu shots. A public outcry blamed the deaths on the immunizations even though there was no evidence. As a recent

article in Salon

notes, ""The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu — now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations.""
 
Political analyst Craig Crawford wrote this week that ""Gerald Ford's decision to inoculate every person in the country (including himself) resulted in a political debacle that contributed to a reputation for incompetence that scuttled his 1976 election bid.""
 
Swine flu also surfaced briefly in 1988, killing a woman in Wisconsin who had visited a swine exhibit at a county fair. The president at the time was Ronald Reagan — a Republican.
 
So Bachmann is wrong about a Democrat being in charge during the 1976 outbreak and she fails to note the swine flu death in 1988. Hmmm. Two swine flu incidents during Republican administrations. By Bachmann's logic, we should find that ""interesting."" But we don't. It's ridiculous for her to suggest a partisan link with a deadly disease. That's not just a mistake, that's absurdly false. So we'll get out the lighter (after we wash our hands!) and set the Truth-O-Meter ablaze. This one's a Pants on Fire.

Studies show handwashing reduces disease
","
President Barack Obama was asked about swine flu at a prime-time news conference marking his first 100 days in office. The reporter wanted to know if Obama would consider quarantines or closing the border with Mexico, where the flu appears to have started.
 
Obama said his health advisers were not recommending closing the border.
 
""But the most important thing right now that public health officials have indicated is that we treat this the same way that we would treat other flu outbreaks, just understanding that because this is a new strain, we don't yet know how it will respond to that,"" Obama said.
 
""So wash your hands when you shake hands. Cover your mouth when you cough. I know it sounds trivial, but it makes a huge difference,"" Obama said. ""If you are sick, stay home. If your child is sick, keep them out of school. If you are feeling certain flu symptoms, don't get on an airplane, don't get on any system of public transportation where you're confined and you could potentially spread the virus.""
 
We wondered about hand-washing and covering your mouth when you cough. Have our mothers been right all these years?
 
Indeed, Obama's remarks mirror the advice from the Centers for Disease Control almost perfectly.
 
When it comes to preventing the flu, the CDC recommends the following:
 
• Avoid close contact.
 
• Stay home when you are sick.
 
• Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
 
• Clean your hands.
 
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
 
• Practice good health habits, like getting lots of sleep, getting exercise, and eating nutritious food.
 
We also found numerous independent scientific studies that found handwashing significantly reduced the transmission of disease, including the MRSA bacteria and the flu.
 
The University of Michigan School of Public Health is in the midst of a two-year study examining whether face masks and handwashing can reduce the transmission of the flu. The study tracked the spread of flu among college students in university dorms, and used a control group to compare outcomes.
 
Initial results indicate that face masks and hand sanitizing reduced the transmission rate of the flu by as much as 50 percent.
 
But knowing you should wash your hands and doing it are two different things. And putting your hands under the faucet for three seconds and then wiping them on your slacks doesn't count.
 
Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of

Consumer Reports

magazine, has been trying to raise awareness of the importance of handwashing in hospitals. Studies show that doctors and health care workers wash their hands only about half the time they should before examining patients, said Lisa McGiffert, the director of the group's ""Stop Hospital Infections"" campaign.
 
""Some people think that this is such a simple thing that it couldn't make a difference. But it does,"" McGiffert said. ""This is what the experts have been trying to get health care workers and doctors to do for decades, and it does make it difference.""
 
Hand sanitizers are a good substitute for handwashing, and coughing into your arm is better than coughing into your hand, she said. To make sure you've washed your hands thoroughly, sing

Happy Birthday

(silently, please). When the song is over, you've washed long enough. And regular soap works just fine.
 
Obama said that handwashing and covering your mouth when you cough can make a huge difference. The scientific consensus on handwashing backs him up. We rate his statement True.

Harry Reid among flip-floppers on Senate's 'nuclear option'
","""What they are attempting to do in this instance is really too bad. It will change this body forever. We will be an extension of the House of Representatives, where a simple majority there can determine everything."" Sen. Harry Reid, remarks on Senate floor, May 23, 2005 ""The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change, as it has over the history of this great country. To the average American, adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense. This is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This is about making Washington work — regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate. Sen. Harry Reid, remarks on Senate floor, Nov. 21, 2013 After years of threats and retreats by both parties, the Democratic Senate majority on Nov. 21, 2013, enacted a controversial rule change called the ""nuclear option."" The change eliminated the filibuster — a blockage of floor action, typically by the chamber’s minority party — for executive branch nominations as well as judicial appointments short of the Supreme Court. Under the new rule, the Senate only needs a 51-vote majority instead of a 60-vote supermajority to end a filibuster and move to a final vote on a nomination. The question of whether to change the rule has long divided the chamber’s majority and its minority. In fact, supporting or opposing the ""nuclear option"" has been much more closely linked to a senator’s position in the majority or the minority than whether they’re a Republican or Democrat. This means that both sides in this recent faceoff made different arguments than they had in previous iterations of the battle. The rule change was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and was implemented with the support of all but a few Democrats and no Republicans. Yet Reid had strongly condemned the nuclear option when he was still in the minority. Time to take out the Flip-O-Meter! PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on whether the change is justified or not. It simply looks at whether they did, indeed, change their stated position. We’ll take a look back to 2005, when the partisan lineup was substantially different. President George W. Bush had recently won a second term, while his fellow Republicans had a majority in the Senate. (The House was also controlled by Republicans, but the House isn’t directly involved in the filibuster fight.) In the Senate, the Democratic minority had filibustered a number of Bush’s judicial appointments, displeasing Republicans, who seriously considered implementing the nuclear option that would allow them to confirm judges with a simple majority. The effort drew the outrage of Democrats, among them then-Minority Leader Reid. ""You should not be able to come in here and change willy-nilly a rule of the Senate,"" Reid said on the Senate floor in May 2005. Reid was afraid how a nuclear option could undermine the power of the Senate. ""What they are attempting to do in this instance is really too bad. It will change this body forever,"" he said. ""We will be an extension of the House of Representatives, where a simple majority there can determine everything."" The threat to go nuclear was eventually rescinded when a bipartisan group of senators – the ""Gang of 14"" – pledged to block the effort. Seven Democrats agreed to no longer support their party’s filibusters on judicial nominees, while seven Republicans promised not to vote with their colleagues to invoke the nuclear option. In 2008, when Reid was already the Senate majority leader, he discussed the 2005 events in an interview with C-SPAN. He continued to condemn the fact that the Republicans even contemplated using the nuclear option: ""The Senate was set up to be different, that was the genius, the vision of our Founding Fathers. … That's why you have the ability to filibuster, and to terminate filibuster. They wanted to get rid of all of that,"" Reid said.   Then he was asked if he would ever consider invoking the nuclear option himself: ""As long as I am the leader, the answer’s no,"" Reid promised. ""I think we should just forget that. That is a black chapter in the history of the Senate. I hope we never ever get to that again because I really do believe it will ruin our country."" Fast-forward to 2013. Now, Democrats held the White House and a Senate majority. The Republican minority had been stalling nominations and appointments by Obama, including filibustering the nomination of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense. Senate Democrats decided to go nuclear after the Senate GOP made clear that they had no intention of allowing three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be filled. At that point, Senate Democrats took the opposite view they had taken in 2005. Led by Majority Leader Reid himself, they successfully invoked the nuclear option in a near-party-line vote, 52-48. Before the vote, Reid explained his plan on the Senate floor: ""The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change, as it has over the history of this great country … This is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This is about making Washington work — regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate,"" Reid said. Then he added: ""It is time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete."" Our ruling In 2005, Reid strongly condemned a proposed Senate rule change by the Republican majority. This week, with a Democratic majority, he proposed it himself.

Mike Huckabee says more people want to hunt moose in New Hampshire than want Obamacare
","With dismal early enrollment numbers, the new federal health insurance marketplace that went live in October 2013 has been derided by critics, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Speaking on his radio program, The Mike Huckabee Show, on Nov. 18, 2013, the one-time Republican presidential candidate argued that a staggeringly low number of Americans are interested in buying coverage under Obamacare. For example, in New Hampshire, Huckabee said, only 269 people enrolled in a health insurance plan through the new federal health insurance exchange. ""To compare that, 281 people in New Hampshire were issued permits to hunt moose,"" Huckabee said. ""So I mean, the fact is, you've got more people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want Obamacare."" Huckabee tried to drive home his point a little further, asking, ""Which is more likely to help you survive the winter in New Hampshire, a freezer full of moose meat or health insurance that your doctor won’t even accept?"" The moose reference was so catchy that variations of the claim were made on several other talk radio shows around the same time, and they and took off across Facebook and Twitter as well. Huckabee’s radio show is broadcast on more than 200 radio stations in 44 states. We reached out to Huckabee, who offered little explanation. ""It was a radio story I did based on report from NH that more people had applied for moose hunting permits than signed up for Obamacare,"" he said through a staffer. We wondered if it was true that more people in the state want to bag a moose than want to buy health insurance under Obamacare. First, the numbers. Huckabee is correct that New Hampshire’s Fish and Game Department issued 281 permits to moose hunters this year. But the number who wanted to go moose hunting was higher. Wildlife officials received more than 13,000 applications from people wanting to go moose hunting this year, and the state held a lottery to determine who got the permits. Not all of those applications were from New Hampshire residents, but there were about 13,000 people ""wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire."" Meanwhile, as of Nov. 2, 2013, only 269 people in New Hampshire had enrolled in a new health insurance plan. That’s fewer than the number of permits to hunt moose in New Hampshire, and far fewer than the number of applications to hunt moose in New Hampshire. But is that number greater than the amount of people in New Hampshire who ""want Obamacare?"" This is where things get tricky, because there’s no way to know how many people in New Hampshire want insurance coverage through the federal marketplace. By asserting that only 269 people in the state want a health care plan through the federal marketplace, Huckabee implies that everyone who wanted to sign up for coverage under Obamacare has already done so. There are a few reasons why this probably isn’t the case. For starters, it’s possible that some people just haven’t gotten around to enrolling in a plan yet. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services predicted the pace of enrollment would initially be slow when the marketplace opened in October 2013. DHHS is anticipating peaks in December -- when the deadline falls to apply for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2014 -- and March, when the open enrollment period is scheduled to end. It’s also true that lingering technical problems with the federal health care website prevented some people in New Hampshire from signing up. New Hampshire engaged in a partnership with the federal government to operate its insurance exchange. That means residents who want to buy coverage online must navigate through healthcare.gov, the troubled website that was established to support the president’s health reform law. And while only 269 New Hampshire residents have enrolled in a new health care plan through the federal marketplace, a far greater number of individuals were listed as having completed applications. Some 7,817 people from New Hampshire were named on those applications. Very few of them enrolled in a plan, but it can be argued that every individual named on an application showed some level of interest in buying coverage under Obamacare. Many, if not most of these people, can reasonably be assumed to want Obamacare. We also have to consider the possibility that enrollment numbers increased during the month of November 2013. Huckabee cited data that reflects only the enrollment numbers up to Nov. 2, 2013. Sixteen days transpired between then and Nov. 18, 2013, when Huckabee made his claim. On that same day, the New York Times reported that enrollment through the federal health insurance marketplace had increased from less than 27,000 people nationwide during October to about 50,000 by mid-November. The new group of customers may include people from New Hampshire. The Department of Health and Human Services isn’t expected to release new enrollment figures until mid-December, making it impossible for now to gauge exactly how many additional people in New Hampshire have signed up. Our ruling Huckabee said that there are ""more people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want Obamacare."" His statement is grounded in some verifiable data, but his wording choice casts doubt on the accuracy of the statement. On the one hand, at least 13,000 people applied to go moose hunting in New Hampshire this year, which is far more than the 269 who bought insurance through the new marketplace during the first month it was operational. However, it’s unlikely that only 269 people in New Hampshire want Obamacare. For starters, 7,817 New Hampshire residents were named on applications as potential enrollees. And others were likely scared away by the federal website’s technical problems, and the pace of enrollment was always expected to increase as deadlines neared. The bottom line is that no one can truly know how many people in New Hampshire ""want Obamacare"" at this early stage of enrollment.

"['National', 'History', 'Harry Reid']","
Harry Reid says 82 presidential nominees have been blocked under President Barack Obama, 86 blocked under all other presidents
","As Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was about to execute the ""nuclear option"" -- changing the chamber’s rules to eliminate a 60-vote supermajority for executive nominations -- his office released a graphic designed to show how Senate Republicans had used filibusters to target a disproportionate number of President Barack Obama’s nominees. The graphic -- which quickly went viral among Democrats using social media -- showed a pie chart with the following caption. ""In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents."" We received numerous requests from readers to take a look at the numbers. So we did. First, some background. Senators can filibuster, or delay, action either by talking as long as they can on the floor, or by making an objection to party leaders. Such a blockage can be overcome by passing a ""cloture"" motion with a supermajority of votes. Currently, 60 votes are needed to pass a cloture motion and proceed to a final vote on the matter at hand. (Before 1975, it was 67.) Reid pursued the ""nuclear option"" -- called that because it represents a significant break with Senate tradition -- on Nov. 21, 2013. Using a parliamentary maneuver, Reid secured approval to end the minority’s filibuster right in all but extraordinary circumstances for executive-branch nominations and judicial nominations short of the Supreme Court. It passed with 52 Democrats voting in support. When we asked Reid’s office for their supporting evidence for the graphic, they pointed us to two documents from the Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress. Collectively, the two documents list every instance in which a presidential nominee was blocked and cloture was attempted. Looking over the documents, we found that the numbers were essentially right, but that the way the graphic described them was wrong. The most recent of the two documents, a CRS memo, said, ""In brief, out of the 168 cloture motions ever filed (or reconsidered) on nominations, 82 (49 percent) were cloture motions on nominations made since 2009."" This means that the numbers in the graphic -- 82 presidential nominees blocked under Obama and 86 nominees blocked previously -- were described incorrectly. The figures actually represent the number of cloture attempts that had been made, not the people who were nominated . This matters because some of the nominations resulted in multiple cloture efforts. By our calculation, there were actually 68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama’s term, for a total of 147. Reid’s point is actually a bit stronger using these these revised numbers. Using these figures, blockages under Obama actually accounted for more than half of the total, not less then half. Either way, it's disproportionate by historical standards. Indeed, when we presented this finding to Reid’s office, they agreed and released an updated version of the graphic. It now reads, ""In the history of the United States, there have been 168 filibusters of presidential nominees, 82 filibusters under President Obama, 86 filibusters under all other presidents."" ""Point well taken on the number,"" Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson told PolitiFact. ""We have actually been careful to specify that 168 is the number of times a nominee was blocked in our materials. The miswording was unintentional. I don't think the point is any less strong when it is worded as ‘times’ versus ‘nominees.’"" We found another bit of questionable wording in the graphic. The report’s count of cloture motions started in 1949, when the Senate first allowed cloture to be sought on nominations. That means that only 11 pre-Obama presidents were included in the count, not the 43 whose thumbnail portraits are included in the graphic. On this one, however, Jentleson said the office was sticking with its wording. ""I see your point there, but still feel comfortable,"" he said. ""The record suggests that filibusters against nominees were rare prior to 1949. If there were data suggesting that there were enough filibusters against nominees prior to 1949 to make the ‘half in the history of the U.S.’ statistic misleading, we would consider incorporating that into our wording going forward. But as it stands, we believe that the record suggests the opposite."" To support the notion that blocked nominations were rare prior to 1949, Reid’s office provided us with the names of just seven nominations that were rejected before 1949, some of whom were nominated more than once. They are: Roger B. Taney, nominated by Andrew Jackson to be Treasury Secretary; Caleb Cushing, nominated by John Tyler to be Treasury Secretary; David Henshaw, nominated by Tyler to be Navy Secretary; James M. Porter nominated by Tyler to be Secretary of War; James S. Green, nominated by Tyler to be Treasury Secretary; Henry Stanbery nominated by Andrew Johnson to be Attorney General; and Charles B. Warren, nominated by Calvin Coolidge to be Attorney General. None of these appear to have been filibustered, Jentleson said, judging by the relatively short periods between their nomination and their rejection, as well as the fact that each did ultimately get votes. Our ruling Reid’s graphic said that ""in the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents."" The figures are solidly sourced to the Congressional Research Service, but the graphic’s wording was wrong -- an error that Reid’s office acknowledged after we contacted them, and for which they released a corrected version of the graphic. Meanwhile, the question of how many pre-Obama presidents should be included is a bit murkier. The CRS report doesn’t incorporate data prior to 1949, but there’s evidence that blocked nominations were rare to nonexistent before that. Since the revised numbers actually increase the accuracy of Reid's underlying point -- that blockages under Obama have accounted for a disproportionate share of those undertaken in United States history -- we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2B4140>],/factchecks/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-82-presidential-nominees-have-been/
"['National', 'Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Pat McCrory']","
N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory says most Democrats in his state ""agree"" with voter ID, election law
","One of the most contentious battles over voting rights in 2013 took place in North Carolina, where a Republican governor and legislature enacted a bill to overhaul the way the state holds elections. Among other things, the measure -- passed with strong Republican support and broad Democratic opposition -- required voters to show a government-issued ID at the polls, shortened the early voting period, ended same-day voter registration, and ended provisional ballots for voters who go to the wrong precinct. The bill, signed on Aug. 12, 2013, helped spark protests at the state capitol known as ""Moral Mondays."" The critics argued that the law curtailed voting rights to address a rare problem -- voter fraud -- and that minority voters, who disproportionately vote Democratic, could be particularly hard hit. After the law was enacted, the Obama administration’s Justice Department filed a lawsuit to challenge the law. On the Nov. 20, 2013, edition of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown, host Chuck Todd asked Gov. Pat McCrory why he signed the law. McCrory made the argument that the bill was widely supported. ""I think it's more about politics there than anything else,"" he said. Todd responded, ""There's no politics on your side? This is not political at all? You don't see any political benefit for the Republican in these more restrictive laws?"" McCrory replied, ""No. Actually, if you survey, most Democrats also agree with our laws and voter ID."" We wondered: Is it true that a majority of Democrats agreed with the law McCrory signed, and with the concept of showing voter identification at the polls? We found several polls that address these questions. Voter ID In 2011, the newly installed Republican majority in the North Carolina Legislature passed a voter ID law, but it was vetoed by then-Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat. In January 2011, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm that uses automated telephone polling, found that 56 percent of North Carolina Democrats supported a law to ""show a government-issued photo ID in order to vote,"" while 36 percent opposed one. This result supports McCrory’s position, and it was echoed by subsequent live-caller polls conducted by Elon University. In February 2013, an Elon poll found that 52 percent of Democrats supported a law ""requiring voters to show some sort of government approved photo identification before they are allowed to vote,"" while 43 percent opposed it. Other polls backed up this pattern as well. A September 2012 automated-dial poll by SurveyUSA found 56 percent of Democrats supporting a photo ID requirement to vote, and an April 2013 poll by the same firm found 59 percent support among Democrats for showing a government-issued photo ID ""such as a driver's license or passport."" But that had changed by the time Elon asked the question in September 2013 -- nine months after McCrory became the state’s first Republican governor since 1993 and one month after he signed the law. Asked whether they supported or opposed the recently passed law ""requiring voters to show some sort of government-approved photo identification before they are allowed to vote,"" 42 percent of Democrats said they supported it, compared to 54 percent who opposed it. Kenneth E. Fernandez, director of the Elon poll, said he doubts this is a random blip. Elon’s November poll -- which was not released at the time McCrory made his statement -- showed Democratic opposition to voter ID had risen further in the succeeding two months, with 62 percent of Democrats now opposed. ""Prior to September 2013, a majority of Democrats supported the voter ID law, but that is no longer the case,"" he said. ""My guess is that the Moral Monday protests and the national media attention has changed many Democrats’ minds."" Data from another pollster actually detected skepticism among Democrats even before September 2013. In May 2013, the Civitas Institute, a conservative think tank, found that 58 percent agreed with the statement that ""being required to present photo ID disenfranchises poor voters and minorities, and may even violate their constitutional rights to vote."" Only 39 percent said they agreed that a voter ID law ""is a common-sense safeguard against in-person voter fraud."" Democrats were narrowly opposed to voter ID as early as February 2013, when Civitas found that a plurality of Democrats opposed voter ID -- 48 percent supported it, while 49 percent opposed it. The law as a whole In the meantime, we only found one poll that offered partisan breakdowns for a question about the law as a whole. That was an August 2013 survey by Public Policy Polling. Respondents were asked, ""Do you support or oppose the bill the legislature passed that shortened early voting by a week, eliminated same-day voter registration, required a photo ID to vote, eliminated straight-party-ticket voting, and allowed voters to be challenged by any registered voter of the county in which they vote rather than just their precinct?"" Among Democrats, 16 percent said they supported the bill, while 72 percent said they opposed it. In fact, it’s been other parts of the law beyond voter ID that Democrats have most forcefully opposed. Two polls -- by Public Policy Polling in April 2013 and Elon in September 2013 -- found Democrats rejecting early voting changes by 3-to-1 margins. And Public Policy Polling asked in March 2013 about another part of the law -- ending the option of voting for a straight-party ticket. On that question, 70 percent of Democrats said straight-ticket voting should be allowed and just 17 percent said it should be eliminated. It’s worth noting that McCrory has objected to the opponents’ characterizing these changes merely as being reductions in days of early voting without also noting that the total number of hours is to remain the same.  (It's the same number of hours, but stretched over fewer days.) Neither poll added language about the hours remaining the same. After we showed McCrory’s office the data, deputy communications director Ryan Tronovitch stood by the governor’s claim, saying that much of the previous polling aligns with his claim. ""If you want to take Governor McCrory to task over a few percentage points or what poll he was referencing in a two- or three-minute interview, fine, but at the end of the day most North Carolinians support this common-sense law and support showing an ID to vote,"" he said. ""Even the most recent polling you cite (the September Elon poll) shows a high rate of support for the legislation,"" including 94 percent among Republicans, 74 percent among Independents and 70 percent among North Carolinians overall. A note about margins of error Polls are subject to sampling error -- the possibility that the views of the population sampled in the poll diverge from that of the population as a whole. These are expressed as ""plus or minus"" a certain number of percentage points. For polls with large numbers of respondents, the margins of error are usually around three to four points. This means that if a poll has a 3-point margin of error and 51 percent of those surveyed agreed with a particular question, then it’s almost certain that the actual percentage is between 48 percent and 54 percent. The polls cited here have a larger margin of error, because the number of Democrats sampled is smaller than the number of respondents in the entire poll, and that leaves more room for uncertainty. We asked the polling directors and they said the margin of error in these polls for Democrats alone tended to be between 6 and 7 percentage points. This means that most of the voter ID polls mentioned here -- those with differences between ""support"" and ""oppose"" of smaller than 12 to 14 percentage points -- have a higher degree of uncertainty. However, this high margin of error cuts both ways for the purposes of our fact check. Democrats can’t claim with certainty that Democratic sentiment now runs against voter ID, but neither can McCrory claim with certainty that most support the policy. Our ruling McCrory said, ""If you survey, most (North Carolina) Democrats also agree with our (election) laws and voter ID."" There’s a bunch of polling data on this question; some of it is conflicted, and much of it with a degree of uncertainty due to small sample sizes in the polls. Still, there’s enough data to cast at least some doubt on the accuracy of McCrory’s statement. While a majority of North Carolina Democrats were indeed comfortable with a voter ID law for many months, that support turned to disapproval beginning no later than September 2013 (according to the Elon poll) and possibly as early as February 2013 (according to the Civitas poll). And the one poll question that asked about the law as a whole found strong opposition among Democrats, to a degree that is well outside the margin of error. We give more weight to the recent polls that were public knowledge when he made his statement, so we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970BF240>],/factchecks/2013/nov/22/pat-mccrory/nc-gov-pat-mccrory-says-most-democrats-his-state-a/
"['Debt', 'Medicare', 'Military', 'Social Security', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Medicare and Social Security -- not defense -- are driving debt, says Marco Rubio
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gave a speech about foreign policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute Nov. 20. After his speech, a Floridian in the audience asked him a question about how to convince Americans to support consistent defense spending. During part of his answer, Rubio made some claims about the debt. ""The reason we have a national debt is not because of defense spending. What is driving our long-term debt are Medicare and Social Security programs that are structured in unsustainable ways."" We decided to check in with several economists across the political spectrum and ask if Rubio’s assessment about the debt was correct. Medicare, Social Security and defense The economists we interviewed generally agreed that Medicare and Social Security account for huge chunks of our long-term debt. However, they also said that defense spending is also a factor, and some experts noted that Rubio left out a couple of other important factors: interest payments on the debt and Medicaid. Rubio didn’t quantify the role of defense in our national debt or specify a timeframe, he simply said that debt isn’t due to defense spending. But it’s a bit too simplistic to let defense spending entirely off the debt hook. ""It is incorrect to say our current debt has nothing to do with defense spending, because we spend a lot of money on national defense every year, and we have large deficits -- therefore defense spending is one of the causes of our debt increase,"" said Josh Gordon of the centrist Concord Coalition. Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute sent us numbers which showed that based on 2014 total spending,  ""defense is 17 percent of the problem, Medicare is 17 percent of the problem, and Social Security is 24 percent of the problem."" Rubio zeroed in on the long-term debt and Medicare and Social Security -- and there is evidence to support his claim. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that spending as a percentage of gross domestic product for entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security will grow much faster than defense. Defense spending will also grow, but at a far slower rate. Here’s a chart we found from the CBO that illustrates that general point; the CBO includes other health programs in the top line in addition to Medicare: 

  By 2023, ""the share of total spending by the entitlements will be much more than defense, and thus increasingly the entitlements are more drivers of deficits and debt than defense,"" Edwards said. While entitlements are more of a problem, ""defense and other areas of spending are problems as well."" All of our spending is responsible for the debt, said Ron Haskins, a senior fellow in the Economic Studies program at the Brookings Institution and a past senior adviser on welfare policy for President George W. Bush. ""However, if you look at the most expensive and rapidly growing items as the major culprits, which seems reasonable to me, then Social Security is the biggest item, and Medicare in particular and health care in general the most rapidly growing in most years,"" Haskins said in an email. ""Rubio’s list does not include a huge item, and that is interest payments. Over the next few decades, interest payments are likely to be the biggest single item in our budget and the most rapidly growing."" Romina Boccia, a fellow in federal budgetary affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, cited spending growth in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Obamacare subsidies for our long-term deficit. ""Social Security is the largest federal spending program and has held this position since surpassing defense in 1993,"" she said. Dean Baker, a liberal economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, argued that Social Security can’t drive the debt. ""Under the law it can only pay benefits insofar as it has money in the trust fund,"" he said. ""This means that it cannot possibly spend more than was collected in Social Security taxes."" (We should note that the questions around the Social Security trust fund are particularly complex. Earlier this year, we rated a claim that the Social Security trust fund is ""sound"" as Half True.) So what’s the solution to reducing our debt? ""Reversing the upward trajectory of the debt will require taking a look at ways to control health costs and reform Social Security,"" said Jason Peuquet at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""But that doesn't mean other savings can't play a vital role. Reforming the tax code to raise more revenue and reducing other spending will be vital elements in actually getting the debt under control."" Our ruling Rubio said in a speech, ""The reason we have a national debt is not because of defense spending. What is driving our longterm debt are Medicare and Social Security programs."" Rubio is correct that Medicare and Social Security are drivers of our debt -- but there are other factors, too, including Medicaid and interest, economists said. Also, defense spending isn’t entirely off the hook. While Medicare and Social Security are projected to grow as a percentage of GDP, defense is projected to shrink by the same measurement -- but defense is a factor in our debt, albeit a far lesser one. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097561040>],/factchecks/2013/nov/22/marco-rubio/medicare-and-social-security-not-defense-are-drivi/

University of Texas student-athletes may borrow limited number of iPads, but all of them don't automatically get them
","Speaking against paying student-athletes, a long-time Texas Longhorn official said sports scholarships already include special benefits. Jody Conradt, a University of Texas special assistant, said during a Sept. 28, 2013, Texas Tribune Festival panel discussion on the UT campus: ""I have to make one point. We’re not just talking about a scholarship as defined by scholarship. We’re talking about the money spent, unlimited tutors, unlimited access to athletic training; all of your injury issues are taken care of. You can get money to go home at Christmas if that is an emergency… You can get clothes, through a program called the Student Athlete Opportunity Fund."" Conradt, who coached the UT women’s basketball team for 31 years, continued: ""So over time there have been ways to give more benefit to student-athletes that is not what people consider the scholarship."" For instance, she said, ""all... student athletes get an iPad. They get a lot of things that the normal student does not."" Most of those declared benefits didn’t surprise us. But does each UT student-athlete get the popular Apple iPad tablet (which were retailing for about $180 to $500, depending on screen sizes and other features, when we online window-shopped this November)? Nick Voinis, UT’s senior associate athletic director, told us by phone that UT’s student-athletes, who numbered 551 as of mid-November, may borrow iPads, Amazon Kindles and other electronic equipment thanks to a fund created by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for intercollegiate athletics. Voinis stressed that many student-athletes come to school already having computers, laptops or iPads. Still, he said, the option is there for those students to check out a laptop or iPad. ""Some check them out for a day or two, some for a semester,"" Voinis said, or the full year. He said the programs keeps 30 tablets, mostly iPads, available for checkout. For the year that started in August 2013, Voinis said, nearly $338,000 flowed from the NCAA to UT’s Student Athlete Opportunity Fund. Those dollars, he said, could be spent on computers, laptops, iPads, school supplies and other items such as university fees not covered by scholarships, including emergency trips home. That’s correct, a NCAA official told us. According to an Aug. 22, 2012, online post by the NCAA, the association and its member schools in 2010-11 paid more than $53 million to more than 81,000 student-athletes. ""The money, which comes from the NCAA’s Student Assistance Fund, paid for trips home, clothing, summer school, tutoring, graduate test fees, health insurance and countless other costs that scholarships don’t cover,"" the NCAA said. ""A version of the Student Assistance Fund was first offered in 1999, after the NCAA inked a $6 billion broadcast deal with CBS. The decision to start the fund came from the NCAA’s desire to give back to student-athletes more directly than through grants or other forms of aid that are often laden with restrictions. The fund has grown each year since its inception."" By email, NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn pointed out an association rule (15.01.6.1) restricting how such aid is spent. The rule says universities shall not tap such aid to finance salaries, grants-in-aid (other than summer school) for student-athletes with remaining eligibility, capital improvements, stipends and outside athletics development opportunities for student-athletes (e.g., participation in a sports camp or clinic, private sports-related instruction, greens fees, batting cage rental, outside foreign tour expenses)."" So iPads are permitted, it looked to us. We recognized another way that some student-athletes land iPads--as gifts to participants in football bowl games. Players in the 2012 Valero Alamo Bowl, which was won by the Texas Longhorns, received $550 worth of gifts including an iPad Mini, bowl spokesman Rick Hill told us by phone. Our ruling Conradt said all UT student-athletes get an iPad. That’s not so, though less than 30 iPads are available for UT’s 500-plus student-athletes to borrow for up to a year at a time.

Braves seek home run with Cobb plan
","The Atlanta region has many places where one can walk from home to bars, restaurants and other entertainment options. But none of those places includes a baseball stadium. When the Atlanta Braves unveiled renderings of the proposed $1 billion stadium and entertainment complex in Cobb County, one team official boasted that no one has embarked on such an ambitious plan. ""No one in the country has ever built a brand-new sports facility and created this kind of development at the same time,"" Braves Executive Vice President Mike Plant told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The team made the same claim to Channel 2 Action News when it unveiled renderings of its plans Wednesday. As Cobb’s elected officials and community leaders debate the blockbuster plan to fund the team’s move to the area, the Braves are apparently using this claim as a talking point to sway residents to support the plan. Cobb commissioners are scheduled to vote on the plan Tuesday. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Plant was entirely correct about the scope of what the team wants to accomplish. The Braves’ plan consists of two phases: Phase One: stores, restaurants and a possible hotel, totaling between 700,000 square feet and 1 million square feet. Phase Two: residential options, such as apartments and condos, and potential offices. The Braves plan also includes an amphitheater. The team plans to have everything open when the umpire yells ""Play Ball!"" for the first time in 2017. Pro sports franchises are becoming more creative in their business approach. One idea is to make the areas surrounding the sports facility a fan-friendly experience that encourages them to hang around before or after a game and spend money. ""I’ll call it baseball Atlantic Station,"" Georgia State University professor Bruce Seaman said, referring to the popular residential, shopping and entertainment district in Atlanta. ""(The Braves) want fans to get there early and stay late."" Over the years, one of the Braves’ biggest rivals has been the New York Mets, who play in Queens, N.Y. In nearby Brooklyn, another development project with a sports facility rivals what the Braves have in mind. In 2012, the Brooklyn Nets basketball team began its first season at its new $1 billion arena, the Barclays Center. The arena is part of a $5 billion project called the Atlantic Yards that includes about 6,430 units of housing and nearly 700,000 square feet of retail and office space on 22 acres in downtown Brooklyn. The first phase of the project includes the arena and five other buildings, most of which will be residential with market-rate and affordable housing. The second phase includes 11 residential buildings, 8 acres of open space and neighborhood retail. News accounts say the Atlantic Yards housing component has been behind schedule and the original developer, Forest City Ratner, announced plans last month to sell 70 percent of the project to Chinese-based developer Greenland. In Los Angeles, developers built an entertainment and hotel project called L.A. Live around the Staples Center, home to four professional basketball and hockey franchises. The Staples Center opened in 1999, and the subsequent development included a 7,100-seat theater, 13 restaurants, several nightclubs, a movie theater and several hotels, including a Ritz-Carlton with residential units that start at $1.3 million. L.A. Live was completed in 2010. The Los Angeles City Council approved construction of the Staples Center in 1997 on the condition that the developers eventually build the entertainment complex to help the city’s Convention Center attract more business, according to the Los Angeles Times. L.A. Live was built between 2007 and 2010, nearly a decade after the Staples Center opened. Seaman, who specializes in sports economics, said he’s unaware of any development projects that have been done simultaneously with sports facilities. Seaman said the L.A. Live project may come closest to what the Braves want to do. Braves spokeswoman Beth Marshall called the L.A. Live project ""awesome,"" but she noted that the sports arena was completed several years before the rest of the complex. For most stadium/arena projects, one element of the project is completed before the other, Marshall said. Construction on the first part of the residential component of the Brooklyn project began two months after the arena opened. ""This is the first time the development and the stadium have been built simultaneously,"" Marshall said. Similar mixed-use development plans in conjunction with pro sports facilities are in the works in other parts of the country. In Minneapolis, the development firm Ryan Cos. is planning a 125-unit apartment complex and a pair of commercial and residential towers to go along with a new football stadium for the NFL’s Minnesota Vikings. The team, the state of Minnesota and the city of Minneapolis are sharing the construction costs of the $975 million stadium. The stadium and the additional development, estimated to cost $400 million, are both scheduled to be completed by September 2016, according to news reports. In Santa Clara, Calif., two teams of developers are planning mixed-use projects near the home of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers, which is under construction. One of the projects -- a $400 million luxury hotel, office and entertainment project -- is being quarterbacked by Hall of Fame 49ers signal caller Joe Montana. Again, Plant said no one in the country has built a new sports facility and development as the Braves envision at the same time. Technically, he’s correct that no one has currently constructed a project with the type of retail, residential, restaurants and other proposed elements simultaneously. Other sports facilities have been planned along with development projects. Different portions of the Brooklyn project were being constructed at about the same time. The Minneapolis project is being built simultaneously, but by different developers. The Staples Center was approved with the goal of adding additional development alongside the arena. PolitiFact Georgia believes there is some context necessary to fully examine Plant’s statement.

David Axelrod says 8.5 million Americans received rebates from health insurance companies in 2013
","It’s not an easy time to be a supporter of the health care law. There’s rage at every turn, for the millions of policy cancellation notices in Americans’ mailboxes, for the faulty online marketplace, and for President Barack Obama’s leadership in general. David Axelrod, Obama’s former campaign strategist and adviser, tried batting down the dearth of bad press with some positive statistics about the law Thursday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. The law allows young adults under 26 to stay on their parents’ plan, prohibits insurers from refusing coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, and eliminates lifetime caps, Axelrod said. Plus, ""8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care."" Shortly after his segment, Axelrod took to Twitter and said he was talking about rebates sent in 2013. We wanted to know if his point is accurate. You’re probably wondering who got free money from their insurance companies, and why, because it likely wasn’t you. One of the health care law’s many requirements demands health insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of each dollar they charge in premiums on medical care, not for administrative purposes. Policy wonks know it as the medical loss ratio, or the 80/20 rule (for larger employers, it’s more like the 85/15 rule, but that’s more than we need to know for this fact-check). Some Americans know it as the way they got paid by their insurer. If a company spends less than 80 percent on medical services, it must return the difference to the consumer either as a cash payment or as a reduction in future payments. Two-thirds of insurance companies were already meeting the ratio without a policy change, according to a 2011 Government Accountability Office study, though compliance varied upon policy type. For example, 77 percent of companies that sold to large employers with more than 100 employees met the 80/20 rule, while only 43 percent of companies serving customers in the individual market were in compliance. The ratio does not apply to self-funded plans. Insurance companies had to report their premiums and spending for the first time in 2011. Companies returned $1.1 billion in total rebates to 13.1 million policyholders in 2012, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. Companies returned about half as much in rebates in 2013 to 8.85 million policyholders (Axelrod was citing the agency’s original estimate of 8.5 million recipients). The average rebate was $98. So Axelrod is on somewhat solid ground here. But there’s a caveat. While 8.85 million policyholders were due rebates, it doesn’t mean people are getting checks as Axelrod claimed. Our colleagues at PolitiFact  pointed this out in a statement from Obama over the summer. (Obama also tried to put a dollar amount on the checks, which led to a rating of Half True.) About one-third, or 2.9 million people, received rebates for coverage in the individual market in 2013 (the proportion was about the same in 2012). That means they physically got a check. The rest of the rebates went to the small and large employers who manage health insurance plans for their employees. Employers and employees often share the cost of health insurance, with employers picking up the bulk of the cost. In those cases, the rebate goes to the employer because they buy the insurance. But the law requires that the rebate be split proportionately. Employers can pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by ""applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees,"" such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits. Again, the rebates came but they doesn’t mean it trickled down to policyholders in the form of a check. Our ruling Axelrod said, ""8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care."" He is correct on the number of rebates. However, like Obama before him, Axelrod’s claim isn’t clear on the fact that these checks are mostly going to employers who run plans for their workers, not individual Americans. Employers can then choose to pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by ""applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees,"" such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A4B240>],/factchecks/2013/nov/21/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-85-million-americans-received-r/
"['Tourism', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott declares Florida 'the top travel destination across the world'
","Florida Gov. Rick Scott is our salesman-in-chief when it comes to recruiting tourists. His office blasted a press release chock full of statistics about tourism in Florida that made us nod off like a lazy tourist on the beach -- until we came across this phrase: ""As we move toward our third consecutive year of record tourism growth, it is clear why the Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world,"" stated the Nov. 15 press release. The ""top travel destination across the world""? Is the home state of Mickey Mouse kicking the derriere of tourist hot spots like France? We went on a virtual trip to find out. Florida tourism stats We asked a spokesman for Scott for an explanation as to how he arrived at his claim. John Tupps said Scott was simply expressing a personal opinion that Florida is the best place to visit in the whole world, not making a quantitative statement. ""The governor truly believes Florida is the ‘top travel destination’ in the world,"" Tupps said in an email. ""It’s his personal view."" We thought Scott’s wording went further than a personal opinion, though, so we decided put his statement on the Truth-O-Meter. We soon found that comparing tourism stats is tricky, because various states and countries use different methodologies to count visitors. Visit Florida, a quasi-state agency, counts out-of-state, overnight visitors. By that measurement, Florida had 91.5 million visitors in 2012. In California in 2012, there were 61 million out-of-state overnight trips. New York had about 62 million overnight out-of-state visitors in 2011, the most recent year available. So in state-to-state competition, Florida wins on the metric that Visit Florida uses. But the picture changes when we look around the world. According to the U.N.’s World Tourism Organization, in 2012, there were 83 million international visitors to France, compared with the United States in second place with 67 million. So on the metric of international visitors, France is clearly leading Florida. ""We continue to say our goal is to beat France,"" said Kathy Torian, a spokeswoman for Visit Florida. Still, the comparison of Florida with France is tricky, because France is a country and Florida is a state. Florida’s 19 million population is about one-third the size of France’s population of about 66 million. Also, many Europeans travel to France just for a weekend, or visitors book a short stay in France, and then move on to other European destinations. So France may not be as dominant as its visitor counts make it appear. Comparing the number of visitors is not the only way to compare tourism rankings. We could also examine the amount of money spent by visitors. And while France is No. 1 in the number of international visitors, it tumbles behind the United States and Spain when you consider spending, the AP reported: ""International visitors spent more than double in the U.S. than they did in France in 2012 – $126.2 billion, compared to $53.7 billion, according to the U.N.’s World Tourism Organization. That despite the fact that France welcomed 20 percent more tourists."" The U.S. Travel Association reports that travel spending was $71.5 billion in Florida in 2011. That amount lags behind California, at $105 billion in 2011. Both those numbers top France's $53.7 billion in 2012. But to Scott's point, those spending numbers still don't put Florida in the No. 1 position. Our ruling While touting Florida’s tourism numbers, Scott said, ""The Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world."" There isn’t one simple way to declare ""the"" top travel destination in the world. But Scott’s claim would probably elicit a ""mais non!"" from Scott’s counterparts in France, who can boast to being the undisputed global leader of international tourists. And if you don't consider France a fair comparison, recent data on travel spending shows that California edges out Florida. Visit Florida is clamoring to achieve that No. 1 ranking, but we didn’t find proof that we are already there. Scott is clearly a cheerleader for his own state, but the data to back up his claim is murky and difficult to substantiate. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096682B00>],/factchecks/2013/nov/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-declares-florida-top-travel-destination/

Wasserman Schultz tweets 500K signed up for Obamacare
","A lot of numbers were thrown at us when the White House finally announced on Nov. 13 how many individuals had signed up for health care coverage through online marketplaces. The general consensus, including from many Democrats, is the early returns were underwhelming. Still, there was a lot of confusion. How many successfully navigated through the error-laden federal marketplace website? Who actually purchased coverage? Where does Medicaid fit into all of this? Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., tweeted a simple breakdown. ""This week we found out 500,000 people have signed up for #Obamacare,"" the chair of the Democratic National Committee said. ""It's good news, but we have more work to do."" But is that an accurate overview, or did she oversimplify it? We decide to break it down ourselves. To the numbers The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has the statistics of who signed up in the first month: From Oct. 1 to Nov. 2, 1,509,883 people applied for coverage through a federal or state marketplace. Of those individuals, 106,185 approved applicants actually picked an insurance plan — 79,391 through a state marketplace and 26,794 through the federal marketplace. About a quarter of the people who applied, or 396,261, were told they were eligible for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Wasserman Schultz’s office said her tweet came by adding those who picked a private insurance plan to those deemed eligible for Medicaid. And it’s true, adding those two figures together gets us 502,446. But have those people ""signed up for Obamacare""? President Barack Obama didn’t put it so bluntly. Instead, at a Wall Street Journal CEO Council meeting Nov. 19, he said ""About half a million Americans are now poised to gain health care coverage beginning Jan. 1."" (Wasserman Schultz’s camp said they were simplifying matters to meet Twitter’s pesky 140-character limit.) We should note here that Obamacare is a complex law with many moving parts, not a single government program in which people enlist. (Wasserman Schultz knows that, but the average voter might not.) The Medicaid element in particular adds a perplexing twist. Medicaid is an existing state-federal health insurance program largely for the poor. The health care law allows states to expand Medicaid eligibility, and some states are doing that, while others aren’t. According to the Department of Health and Human services, about 400,000 individuals were ""determined or assessed eligible for Medicaid or CHIP,"" but are they actually signed up? Does the applicant have to take additional steps to officially enroll, just as he or she must pick a plan after the application is processed? The federal health department said they shouldn’t have to. Instead, ""the state Medicaid or CHIP agency takes additional steps to finalize an eligibility determination,"" according to a health department report. In states like Kentucky, who run their own marketplace, it’s pretty seamless. ""We have a streamlined application process,"" said Jill Midkiff, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services. ""Somebody comes in and gives the information, and if they’re determined eligible for Medicaid then they’re directed to Medicaid, and that happens pretty quickly."" From there, the applicant picks a Medicaid provider, and if they don’t, one is assigned to them. For states operating under the federal marketplace, the process involves a bit more red tape. In some states, Medicaid eligibility is determined by the federal marketplaces, and if eligibility is met, the individual should be all set. In others, the final eligibility determination is left up to the states. Florida, for example, opted out of the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and chose not to operate its own marketplace. Some people applying through healthcare.gov are eligible for the state’s existing program. For those people, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families said determining final eligibility will be ""quick but not automatic."" But there’s a delay in that process. The federal marketplaces do not yet have the functionality to transfer Medicaid eligibility data to the states. And it’s unclear when it will be. With 36 states relying on the federal government to run the insurance marketplace, that could push back Medicaid enrollment for thousands beyond Jan. 1 if it is not fixed in the coming weeks. As another example, Arizona expanded Medicaid, but also allowed the federal government to run its exchange. There, officials are advising anyone who was told by the federal marketplace they may be eligible for Medicaid to just apply through the state’s online Medicaid portal. ""Once all of these systems are running as they should, there will be no wrong door,"" said Monica Coury with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment Systems. ""The account transfer of Medicaid eligible from the Marketplace to the state will be seamless. But for now, it’s not working as it should, and anyone that looks Medicaid-eligible needs to come in through the state’s site."" A final note: It’s not clear how many individuals told they were eligible for Medicaid would have qualified even before the expansion of the program under Obamacare. Those numbers have not been released by the administration. So it’s possible a large chunk of new Medicaid enrollees would have qualified for the joint federal-state program prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said ""500,000 people have signed up for #Obamacare."" The numbers add up if you count different parts of the law that work together to expand coverage, but it’s a little simplistic. The fate of many of the Medicaid enrollees remains up in the air due to the problems with the federal marketplace. It’s unclear whether those individuals will receive their benefits on time, and some are being asked to take additional steps to sign up.

Ari Melber says Barack Obama's approval ratings are in line with other presidents at this point
","This item was updated at 3:30 p.m. on Nov. 21, 2013, to include an additional comment from Melber. President Barack Obama’s job approval rating took a hit in the first few weeks of November amid a heap of controversy over implementation of the Affordable Care Act. But to hear the folks on MSNBC tell it, Obama’s poll numbers are par for the course for presidents in their second term. Ari Melber, co-host of MSNBC’s The Cycle, said during a segment on the show Monday that Obama’s approval rating isn’t so far off of some second-term presidents. ""As to the approval numbers, it’s very important to understand, we look at Gallup over the entire history of second-term presidents, and you’ve got in the 40s this president,"" Melber said. ""At the same point, 1,700 days or so in, that’s exactly about where (George) W. Bush was, it’s where LBJ (Lyndon B. Johnson) was. (Bill) Clinton was higher because he was a very popular second-termer. ""But this notion that this is really bad or worse for Obama, it’s actually right in the average, and if anything impressive because we’re in such a super polarized time period."" He spoke over a bar chart showing approval ratings of the presidents he mentioned ""about 1,750 days"" into their second term. Here’s a screenshot:  Intrigued by his point, we looked into it. In an interview with PunditFact, Melber told us he used data from Gallup’s Presidential Job Approval Center, an interactive tool that allows users to compare Gallup approval ratings of each president since President Harry Truman (1945-53) at various points in office. Melber isolated Johnson, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. For all but Johnson, the 1,750th or so day falls around the first full week of November. (Johnson’s 1,750th day does not fall around the same time because he finished out Kennedy’s term before being re-elected, so his comparable rating is from September 1968, just months before he left office.) Obama’s 1,750th day fell during the week of Nov. 4-10, when his job approval rating was at 41 percent. For the comparable week, Johnson’s was 42 percent, Bush’s was 40 percent, and Clinton’s was 59 percent. Melber said he chose to compare those presidents because Bush is recent and the others are Democratic two-termers. ""We created the graphic of four presidents' ratings in order to reference those four presidents -- not all presidents,"" Melber said in an email. Even by this narrow comparison, it’s not accurate to say Obama’s poll numbers are ""right in the average."" But we’re not sure viewers would think Melber was comparing Obama with just three other presidents -- particularly when he said ""over the entire history of second-term presidents."" If you expand the pool, how does Melber’s claim stand up? (Gallup’s polling goes back to Harry S. Truman.) Approval rating for presidents in their 1,750th day in office President Percent Obama 41 percent George W. Bush 40 percent Bill Clinton 59 percent Ronald Reagan 65 percent Richard Nixon 27 percent Lyndon Johnson 42 percent Dwight Eisenhower 58 percent Harry Truman 37 percent Average of all presidents 46.8 percent   So the overall average approval rating for those presidents, under Melber’s metric, is about 47 percent -- 6 percentage points higher than Obama. Another way to look at the data Gallup editor in chief Frank Newport said there’s no right way to compare the approval ratings, but he would use a different method. He looked at the monthly average of polls for presidents in the first November of their second term. He argued this way smooths out weekly blips, and offers a more accurate portrayal of Truman and Johnson, who shared first terms with predecessors who died in office. Comparing by the number of days served puts Johnson well into his second term in September 1968, when his approval rating began to sour over the Vietnam War, Newport said. That exaggerates the disparity. Using Newport’s methodology, second-term presidents had an average approval rating of about 51 percent. Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Melber is correct about one thing: This is one of the most polarized eras in American history. ""Sometimes it seems to me that the American people are living in different countries, or different universes,"" she said. ""Republicans and Democrats have completely different impressions."" Bowman also would have gone about the comparison in a different way, starting by including Reagan over Johnson, and by looking at different polls, too. (A CBS News poll released Wednesday, after Melber’s segment, put his approval rating at 37 percent. Gallup’s three-day rolling average for Nov. 17-19 was down to 40 percent.) She said the political climate was so different in Truman and Eisenhower’s time that she, like Melber, would have left them out. She empathized with Melber trying to make a point in a tight crunch on television. ""People pick and choose polling data they want to highlight,"" Bowman said. ""I think he should have been more precise in his wording, but I’m not gonna give him darts and arrows for this kind of thing."" Our ruling Melber said: ""As to the approval numbers, it’s very important to understand, we look at Gallup over the entire history of second-term presidents, and you’ve got in the 40s this president. At the same point, 1,700 days or so in, that’s exactly about where (George) W. Bush was, it’s where LBJ (Lyndon B. Johnson) was. (Bill) Clinton was higher because he was a very popular second-termer."" Depending on what presidents you pick, and how you gauge the time frame, Melber comes close. Obama’s approval ratings are roughly in the range of some presidents. But looking at the numbers other ways produce vastly different results.   Melber’s claim is partially accurate but take things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D11D80>],/factchecks/2013/nov/20/ari-melber/ari-melber-says-obamas-approval-ratings-are-line-o/

Alison Lundergan Grimes says Mitch McConnell 'blocked the Senate over 400 times'
","Is Mitch McConnell the ""guardian of gridlock""? One of the marquee races in the 2014 midterm elections is McConnell’s bid to win a sixth term representing Kentucky. And one of the issues likely to get significant attention in the campaign is whether McConnell, as the Senate’s minority leader, has unduly obstructed the Senate majority’s work. The allegation of obstructionism is at the center of an ad released in October by his Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes. The ad shows a house slowly catching fire, as the narrator says, ""He calls himself a proud guardian of gridlock. He’s blocked the Senate over 400 times, then voted to shut down the government, hurting Kentucky’s economy. Mitch McConnell can’t light the house on fire, then claim credit for putting it out, especially while it’s still burning."" As evidence, the Grimes campaign cited a report by WFPL, the Louisville NPR affiliate, in July 2013. The radio report noted that ""since 2007, Senate statistics show McConnell has used the filibuster 413 times as minority leader. That is almost twice as much as when Democrats held the minority from 1995 to 2001."" The rules behind filibusters can get pretty wonky, but Grimes’ claim has sparked intense discussion concerning some highly technical rules of Senate debate. Our fact-checking colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked into the claim, with FactCheck.org concluding that ""Grimes uses inflated figures,"" and the Fact Checker giving the claim three Pinocchios out of a possible four. Meanwhile, political scientists pushed back, saying Grimes’ claim had merit. We decided to take a fresh look at the evidence. The finer points of Senate procedure Under the Senate’s rules, action on legislation can proceed one of two ways. The smoother path, if it can be achieved, is through unanimous consent of all senators on the terms of a debate. But, as the term ""unanimous"" indicates, this standard means that any senator who wishes to can block consent. The alternative is to file a ""cloture motion."" If it passes, then debate on the underlying legislation can proceed. If it fails, Senate action remains stalled. A cloture motion must secure a supermajority -- 60 votes. Because rounding up 60 votes is no easy task, the Senate’s minority party -- and indeed any individual senator in either party -- can wield significant influence by slowing or stopping action, simply by objecting, either publicly or behind the scenes. The claim in Grimes’ ad, that McConnell blocked the Senate 400 times, counts almost every time a cloture motion was filed between 2007 and 2013. But skeptics have pointed out that, in some of those cases, cloture was approved, meaning that the blockage was ultimately overcome. In other cases, cloture requests were withdrawn, meaning the parties managed to work out an agreement to proceed. And in some cases, it was McConnell who filed cloture to end a Democratic blockage, a move that shouldn’t be considered part of McConnell’s efforts to block action. After weeding out these instances, both Factcheck.org and the Fact Checker settled on 120 cases in which the chamber voted on cloture but failed to approve it. That’s a lot less than 400. McConnell’s office agrees with this interpretation. ""As a matter of a fact check, your job is simple,"" McConnell spokesman Don Stewart told PolitiFact. ""Did McConnell block the Senate ‘over 400 times’ or not? That’s an easy one: No."" The Grimes campaign acknowledged that there are other reasonable interpretations of the data, but said it stands by the ad. Other ways to define obstructionism Experts on congressional procedure told PolitiFact that counting only 120 cloture votes doesn't fully encapsulate the extent of blocking undertaken by McConnell or the conference he leads. Part of the uncertainty stems from the definition of the word Grimes used: ""block."" If blocking means a maneuver that permanently prevents something from happening, then 120 examples would seem to be the right call. But if blocking means a delaying action, sometimes for months or years at a time, then the number of cloture motions filed -- roughly 400 -- begins to look much more defensible. When counting the number of cloture motions filed, rather than just those voted down, ""the sequence of events suggests that the majority tried to move forward but couldn't because they were blocked by the minority,"" said Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution. ""So the majority filed for cloture, and then the minority came to the table. You just can't drop those from the count. McConnell, with support of his party, effectively blocked the Senate, at least temporarily."" Binder offered two examples to illustrate the larger phenomenon. In the first case, Barbara Keenan, a judicial nominee, had to wait four months for a confirmation vote due to GOP opposition. After Reid filed for cloture, the Senate approved cloture by a 98-0 margin. ""Yes, cloture was invoked, but GOP obstruction delayed seating a judge for four months,"" Binder said. Binder’s second example is Richard Cordray, President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Cordray waited almost two years for a vote; one finally came in July 2013, when cloture was approved, 71-29. ""How can you say there was no effort to block the Senate from confirming Corday?"" Binder said. ""The minority tried to block him and they failed."" Binder sees the Keenan and Cordray cases as ""examples of a more general phenomenon."" Other congressional scholars agreed. ""Looking only at things actually killed by failed cloture motions is the narrowest way to look at the impact of filibusters and threatened filibusters,"" said Norm Ornstein, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ""Instances of filibusters invoked on bills and nominations that passed unanimously or nearly so are done to soak up huge amounts of the Senate's most precious commodity, time. I view those actions as blockage."" Steven Smith, a congressional scholar at Washington University in St. Louis, thinks the more expansive definition of what counts as ""blocking"" has merit, because delays aren’t cost-free. ""Agencies that go without leadership, courts struggling with large workloads, departments without regular appropriations, and many, many other consequences of delay cannot be dismissed as inconsequential,"" he said. In fact, if you use the broader definition of ""block"" -- and throw in examples of the minority using amendments, motions, extraneous debate and roll-call vote demands -- then the number 400 could actually underestimate the amount of blocking going on. How much is McConnell to blame? Another tricky issue is whether the obstruction can be pinned on McConnell personally. Most experts we checked with said both parties bear some responsibility for the current paralysis in the Senate -- both due to Democratic actions prior to 2007 (when their party was in the minority) and current actions by the Democratic majority that have minimized the GOP’s ability to offer amendments. In addition, each senator is individually empowered to block whatever legislation they wish, so some of the blocking is being driven by individual senators rather than McConnell specifically. Still, the experts agreed that just because McConnell shares the responsibility doesn’t mean he’s absolved of all responsibility. After all, he’s been the GOP leader since 2007 and once said, ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" Binder believes that as the party’s leader and chief Senate strategist, ""it’s reasonable to hold him accountable for party-backed filibusters."" ""If an observer can't see that this is central to McConnell's style of leadership, then it's time to find another line of work,"" said Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in Congress. Our ruling In her ad, Grimes said that McConnell has ""blocked the Senate over 400 times."" If you look at cases of permanent blockage -- which you can do by counting failed cloture votes -- then Grimes’ number significantly exaggerates the scale of McConnell’s obstructionism. But her 400 figure sounds much more reasonable if one uses a broader definition of ""block"" that counts delays, many of which have gone on for months and even years. In fact, there are enough ways for a minority to gum up the works that aren’t counted in the statistics that the actual number of blockages -- if it could be divined -- could well push the number higher than 400. And that’s a key problem for Grimes -- the number can’t be divined, meaning that Grimes’ figure, even if it is actually a low estimate, communicates a false sense of statistical specificity. It’s also debatable how much McConnell deserves blame for the Senate’s current gridlock, though most experts say he at least deserves some. On balance, we rate Grimes’ claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973FE6C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/20/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-says-mitch-mcconnell-block/

20% of Austinites foreign-born, mostly from Mexico, Asian nations
","""Austin is truly an international city. Nearly 20 percent of our residents are born overseas,"" an Austin city official, Natalie Betts, said in a Nov. 8, 2013, press release about an orientation session in Austin’s International Welcome Program. That sparked our curiosity. City demographer Ryan Robinson told us by phone that according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey analysis covering 2007-11, about 19.3 percent of Austin’s residents were born in foreign countries. Census spokeswoman Virginia Hyer told us by phone that the bureau most recently published results of a survey covering 2010-12, which similarly indicated that about 19 percent of Austinites were born abroad. Hyer said, though, that the five-year survey released Dec. 6, 2012, remained a good source for data on small groups such as foreign-born populations because of its larger sample size. Specifically, according to data from the five-year analysis that city spokeswoman Melissa Alvarado emailed to us, 150,565 of the city’s 782,149 residents were born abroad. (Not included: the 11,548 Austinites born in Puerto Rico and U.S. Island areas or born abroad to American parents, who were classified as ""native."") That makes the Live Music Capital of the World more cosmopolitan than the U.S. in general (13 percent foreign-born) or Texas (16 percent), according to other 2007-11 survey data Robinson emailed us. Austin also edged San Antonio (14 percent) and Fort Worth (17 percent). However, it had fewer residents born abroad than Dallas (25 percent) and Houston (28 percent). Robinson said the increase in Austin’s share of foreign-born residents is a long-term trend, rising from ""maybe 16.5 percent in 2000"" and less in 1990. ""We’ve long had an international community, and it’s very much been tied to the University of Texas. That’s huge,"" he said. Only 23 percent of Austin’s foreign-born residents were U.S. citizens, according to the survey. That doesn’t mean the rest are here illegally, though; the survey did not ask about legal immigration status. In case you’re curious: The 2007-11 survey also showed that 53 percent of Austinites were born in Texas. Among Austinites born abroad, the survey found, the largest contingents came from Latin America (66 percent of the foreign-born population), Asia (24 percent) and Europe (6 percent).   2007-2011 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates:
   State demographer Lloyd Potter told us by phone, ""That’s true for most all of Texas, that the bulk of our immigrants are from Latin American countries. Mexico is without question the biggest sender."" In fact, about one-tenth of all Austinites were born in Mexico, we found in expanded results from the 2007-11 survey. Mexico accounts for more than half the city’s foreign-born population -- 54 percent. Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Cuba each account for 1 percent to 3 percent of those born abroad. Note: The city press release said ""overseas,"" and clearly not all such residents had to cross an ocean to get here, but PolitiFact has equated ""overseas"" with ""outside the U.S."" in numerous past fact-checks. Potter and Robinson each said the percentage of Austinites hailing from Asian nations is noteworthy. In general, Asians are the city’s fastest-growing demographic group, according to an Oct. 23, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story -- surging by 60 percent in the past decade, triple the rate of the city’s overall growth. Of Austin’s foreign-born residents, the five-year survey shows 6 percent were born in India, 4 percent each in China and in Vietnam, and 3 percent in Korea. Potter said high-tech companies in the Austin area draw a high percentage of Asian immigrants seeking higher education or already possessing such an education and in-demand skills; employers then help them get visas. Overall, they tend to have high income and low levels of unemployment, he said. In the longer-established Latin American migrant stream, Potter said, immigrants are more likely to be joining relatives under a ""family preference"" visa, a type that does not require them to have a job in hand. Broadly speaking, Potter said, the group tends to exhibit higher unemployment, lower education and lower income levels. In September 2013, Austin opened an Asian American Resource Center, a 16,000-square-foot community center built in part with $5 million in voter-approved bonds. That center housed the Nov. 9, 2013, ""Welcome to Austin"" orientation advertised in the city’s press release. Betts, the city’s global business recruitment and expansion coordinator, told us by email the session included Korean and Mandarin translation. ""We looked at which languages are spoken by the largest numbers of recent immigrants,"" she said. The first two sessions were in English and Spanish. Participants are briefed on public transportation, schools, health care and city resources such as police, libraries and parks, according to the press release; they also are offered information on starting a small business and on managing finances. What does having one-fifth of its populace born abroad mean for Austin? Robinson said it indicates Austin is increasingly tied to the global economy, for better or worse. And, he said, ""It’s a piece of evidence that supports the narrative that Austin is indeed becoming much more of an international city than it ever was in the past."" Our ruling A City of Austin official said, ""Nearly 20 percent of our residents"" are born abroad. Such residents made up 19.3 percent of the city’s population in the 2007-11 period covered by a federal survey. We rate the statement as True.

Elisabeth Hasselbeck suggests Census worker admitted to 2012 jobs conspiracy
","A drop in the unemployment rate right before the 2012 election has given conservatives a whiff of conspiracy. On the Fox News Channel morning show Fox and Friends, co-hosts Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade and Elisabeth Hasselbeck discussed a New York Post report that alleged Census Bureau workers cooked the books between August and September 2012, dropping the unemployment rate from 8.1 percent to 7.8 percent. Hasselbeck said the report, from a Post columnist, identified one Census Bureau worker who admitted to fudging data in the past. ""Now we're finding out there was someone on one side of the scale,"" Hasselbeck told viewers. ""There was a name, Julius Buckmon. ... He told in an interview that he was told to make up information as he went along. This is on crucial information as we headed into an election season."" The report was also cited on Fox News’ The Five and later on Hannity. We decided to see if Buckmon is indeed a smoking gun about the reported 2012 fraud. We also wanted to learn a little bit more about how the unemployment rate is calculated and what impact a Census Bureau employee can have. The 'Post' report The original New York Post report from columnist John Crudele essentially reaches the same conclusion as Hasselbeck, though perhaps not as definitively. Using an unnamed source, Crudele builds a case that Census Bureau workers were told by their supervisors to help drive down the unemployment rate ahead of the 2012 presidential election. The source also handed over a piece of evidence -- the case of Census Bureau worker Julius Buckmon. Buckmon was part of a Census Bureau team that helped collect information used to calculate the unemployment rate, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households. The Census Bureau is in charge of the people who ask the questions. The data is then collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the Labor Department, which in turn creates monthly employment statistics. Buckmon said he made up at least some of his results instead of surveying households. Buckmon told the Post about a conversation with his supervisor at the bureau. ""It was a phone conversation — I forget the exact words — but it was, ‘Go ahead and fabricate it’ to make it what it was,"" Buckmon said. The problem for Hasselbeck is that Buckmon wasn’t working for the Census Bureau in 2012. According to the Post, the alleged incident he described took place in 2010. Buckmon left the Census Bureau in August 2011, Census Bureau officials told us. So Hasselbeck incorrectly overlapped Buckmon’s story with the rest of the Post article, which relies on an anonymous source. (Buckmon did not return our calls seeking comment.) The unemployment report To be clear, we cannot say if the Post article is correct in its other points. But experts we spoke with agreed that it would be extremely difficult to alter the nationwide unemployment rate. William Shobe, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Studies at the University of Virginia and head of the Virginia chapter of the Association for University and Business Economic Research, said it’s important to remember that there are many measures of unemployment, including privately produced surveys. ""And they all agree, within the margins of error,"" Shobe said. ""The immediate conclusion that you can draw from that is that no rogue interviewer or group of rogue interviewers have managed to budge the unemployment far (or at all, mind you) from the value it would have had otherwise."" Shobe added that any effort to fudge the national numbers would require the participation of interviewers across the country. ""Otherwise you would see only a localized move which would wash out as noise in the national stats,"" Shobe said. Former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Katharine Abraham backs up Shobe’s point. Abraham, who served as commissioner from 1993-2001 under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said that the typical interviewer handles between 35 and 55 households. That would translate to anywhere between about 1,000 and 1,700 interviewers to cover 60,000 households. ""Even if an interviewer made up all of his or her interviews,"" Abraham said, ""each interviewer's share of the full sample is small enough that it would be rather unlikely for the made-up interviews to have affected the topside unemployment numbers at all."" In addition, Abraham said the Census Bureau doesn’t trust its staff blindly. It has a regular and random process of going back to the same households that were interviewed and interviewing them again. As for the drop in the unemployment rate that led to suspicions of manipulation, Abraham remembers the popular reaction at the time, but says the monthly numbers can jump around. ""It's just not that surprising that, in the context of an unemployment rate that was generally trending downwards, there would be months when it took a big drop,"" Abraham said. We should note that the Post story has gained traction beyond the media. Rep, Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chair of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to the head of the Census Bureau, saying he found the allegations ""shocking."" Issa told the bureau to deliver many documents, including emails to or from Buckmon and any investigations of alleged falsification of data. Our ruling Hasselbeck said Julius Buckmon was ""on one side of the scale"" and his fabricated interviews helped push the unemployment rate lower in September 2012. Buckmon did not work for the Census Bureau in 2012 and even if he had, people familiar with the workings inside the bureau doubt it would have made a difference. If he had slanted all of his reports to show a brighter employment picture, he would have likely been found out. If he slanted a smaller number, it would have no statistical impact. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D427C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/20/elisabeth-hasselbeck/elisabeth-hasselbeck-suggests-census-worker-admits/
"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Allan Levene']","
Candidate planning run for Congress in four states
","Crazy. That’s how one constitutional expert described Cobb County resident Allan Levene’s plan to simultaneously run for the U.S. Congress in Georgia and three other states. ""I may be crazy like a fox,"" Levene, a Republican, told us by telephone. Levene, who lives in Kennesaw, recently posted an article on his campaign website claiming the U.S. Constitution does not prevent him from campaigning in multiple states. His plan is to run in Hawaii, Michigan and Minnesota. Levene believes the only constitutional requirement is that he has to be a resident of one of those states before the general election in November 2014. He says he can run in numerous state primaries without living in those states. Levene said he only has to establish residency if he wins a primary and wants to be on the ballot for the general election. PolitiFact Georgia first saw Levene’s claim on The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog. We wondered whether Levene is correct about what the Constitution says and does not say about candidates running for Congress in more than one state? Several experts we interviewed said they had never heard of a candidate running for office in more than one state at the same time. We, too, were unfamiliar with any such situations by an aspiring politician. Our research showed Levene may be a fox in regards to this claim. Levene was a late write-in candidate last year to unseat U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Marietta, who represents Georgia’s 11th U.S. House District, where Levene currently resides. Levene pulled 30 votes in 2012. Gingrey, who routed Democratic challenger Patrick Thompson, performed a little better, garnering 196,968 votes. Levene wants to improve his odds next year. He read Article I, Section II of the U.S. Constitution and came up with his idea. It stipulates that a member of the House of Representatives must be an inhabitant of the state ""when elected."" ""It’s like looking at a wall and the hieroglyphics and I saw an opportunity,"" Levene, a self-employed information technology expert, said of the section. ""Hopefully, it will work."" One opportunity came when Gingrey announced his plans to run for the U.S. Senate in 2014, creating an opening, perhaps, for Levene. Maybe not. Several high-profile GOP candidates have announced plans to run for Gingrey’s seat, such as former Congressman Bob Barr, state Rep. Ed Lindsey, state Sen. Barry Loudermilk, retired U.S. Army Col. Larry Mrozinski and Tricia Pridemore, a former executive director of Georgia’s Office of Workforce Development who is also a close ally of Gov. Nathan Deal’s. In case Levene loses in Georgia, he’s hoping he’ll win the GOP nomination for a House seat in Hawaii, Michigan or Minnesota. Considering the recent cold spell here, we’d recommend Levene focus on the Aloha State. Levene, 64, said he’s too old to try the traditional route of ""working your way"" to Congress by serving on a city council or being mayor, then becoming a star in the state legislature before going to Washington. Perhaps. But doesn’t the Constitution prevent his four-state strategy? Here’s the conclusion Levene posted on his website: ""According to Article One, Clause Two you must inhabit the state when elected. Elections are held in November, not the primaries where the top contenders are selected, typically one Republican and one Democrat. A candidate is not elected at the primary; that election is the semi-final. Even if a candidate wins and no other party opposes him, the election is not official until November. So that one day in November tells the whole story."" The Federal Elections Commission would not formally rule on the constitutionality of Levene’s plan, a spokesman said. Levene said he is awaiting approval from the federal agency on raising funds in multiple states. Levene said he also contacted the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office about his plan. Spokesman Jared Thomas said his office contacted the state Attorney General’s Office for clarity about Levene. ""Mr. Levene will not be disqualified in Georgia as a candidate for Congress in the event he also qualifies in another state,"" Thomas said via email. ""If he, however, wins (the general election) in Georgia and one other jurisdiction, then we will assess from a Georgia law and U.S. Constitution perspective."" Several constitutional scholars we interviewed also referred to that portion of the Constitution when offering their interpretation of the accuracy of Levene’s claim. Duke University law professor Guy-Uriel Charles: ""That strikes me as correct as a matter of the U.S. Constitution."" Emory University law professor Robert Schapiro: ""He doesn’t have to be an inhabitant before"" the primary. University of Texas law professor Joseph Fishkin: ""I think the guy is basically right about the main point -- that you don’t have to live in the district when you put in your primary bid -- just when you win the election."" University of Virginia law professor Dan Ortiz: ""I don’t think there’s any constitutional problem there. It’s crazy. It’s, politically, a crazy strategy."" Fishkin also had doubts Levene’s strategy would work. But if Levene wins the primary in more than state, he presumably would have to withdraw from one of the races, Ortiz said. To sum up, Levene said the U.S. Constitution does not prevent him from running for office in more than one state simultaneously. The one requirement, he said, is that he must be a resident of the state where he is running at the time of the general election. Several constitutional scholars agreed with his assessment. Levene might have uphill political battles ahead. But on his constitutional point, he’s a winner.

"['National', 'Medicare', 'Mark Pryor']","
Rep. Tom Cotton voted to make Medicare voucher system, says Sen. Mark Pryor
","Attack ads are in full swing for the 2014 Arkansas Senate race. The latest back-and-forth between incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican, focused on Medicare funding. Each candidate accused the other of cutting funding. ""Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70,"" Pryor's ad said. ""Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare,"" Cotton’s ad shot back. We’ll address Cotton’s Medicare claim in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on Pryor’s statement about the voucher system. Did Cotton really vote for a voucher system? Cotton’s office did not respond to our requests for comment, but we decided to look into it. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims for years, and it’s still hanging around in 2014 rhetoric. Pryor’s spokesman told us the ad was referencing the Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., budget plan. Ryan first introduced his plan as an alternative to the federal budget in 2009, but he modified it in subsequent years as it gained traction in the House. A big part of his proposal has been to rein in future costs for Medicare. Pryor’s spokesman correctly pointed out that Cotton did vote in favor of Ryan’s budget proposal in March. As we noted in an earlier fact-check in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, we also need to determine if Ryan’s proposed plan in 2013 qualifies as a ""voucher system."" There’s debate in policy wonk circles about what constitutes a voucher system versus ""premium support,"" the term that Republicans prefer. Ryan’s latest plan, the one Cotton voter for, called for a flat payment to eligible seniors (at an increasing age for eligibility) to purchase private insurance or a traditional Medicare plan. The value of the payment would be either equal to the second-cheapest private plan available in a given area, or the cost of traditional Medicare -- whichever is cheaper. The fact that Ryan leaves in the option for traditional Medicare is noteworthy here. That means people can opt to have their subsidy go toward the current system. So there’s no mandatory move to a private plan. That’s a key difference from Ryan’s 2011 proposal. The other big change is that the 2013 plan allows for a different method of indexing of cost growth, which ensures the payments to seniors keep up with the changing economy, according to both left- and right-leaning health policy experts we spoke to. Could we consider this a ""voucher system""? Paul Van de Water, a health policy expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed us toward a book released in 2000 called Vouchers and the Provision of Public Services, which details voucher programs in several spheres, health care being one. A voucher is defined as ""a subsidy that grants limiting purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of goods and services."" The Brookings Institution, published a paper in 1995 that referred to Medicare reform as ""premium support"" but didn’t totally rule out the voucher distinction. One distinction between vouchers and premium support is that a pure voucher system would mean handing people money not adjusted for inflation. However, Ryan’s plan does adjust for cost growth by year. So it’s not a perfect voucher system, which conservative health policy expert Robert Moffit at Heritage Foundation told us in a previous fact-check would resemble a simpler system like airline vouchers for food and drink. Yuval Levin, a health policy expert at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center told us he wouldn’t consider the proposal a voucher system at all. There’s definitely debate over semantics, but to the average voter (if not the average policy wonk), it seems like the word ""voucher"" would accurately describe the basics of Ryan’s proposal (which, by the way, doesn’t sound all that different from the healthcare.gov marketplaces for the uninsured). Calling programs like this ""voucher systems"" has been common in the field for years without negative connotations, Van de Water said. Our ruling Pryor’s campaign ad said Cotton voted to turn Medicare into a voucher system. Liberal and conservative  experts have debated whether it’s a voucher system in every sense of the word. When we set aside the negative connotation that Democrats want to pin to Ryan’s proposal by using the word ""voucher,"" we think it’s still an accurate way to describe the process of encouraging seniors to shop for their own plans from private insurers. The ""voucher system"" is the colloquial way to refer to a program that gives people credit to purchase something. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B80C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/19/mark-pryor/rep-tom-cotton-voted-make-medicare-voucher-system-/

Sen. Mark Pryor 'cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare,' says Rep. Tom Cotton
","So far, PolitiFact has heard some familiar attacks in the 2014 midterm election campaign rhetoric. The latest comes from the Arkansas Senate race, where incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, faces U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican. Recently, they traded jabs over Medicare funding. ""Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70,"" Pryor’s ad said. ""Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare,"" Cotton’s ad shot back. We’ve addressed Pryor’s claim in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on Cotton’s assertion that the Affordable Care Act strips Medicare funding. Cotton’s office didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but we did hear from Pryor’s folks. We’re certainly no stranger to different versions of this claim. There is a connection between the Affordable Care Act and cuts to Medicare funding. Both parties have recognized a need to rein in Medicare costs, which were growing at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ""Without reform, the nation’s already excessive health care spending would have reached unsustainable levels within the next few decades,"" the 2010 CMS report read. With the enactment of the health care law, Medicare’s growth was projected to slow to 5.3 percent, according to the same CMS report. Over time, CMS predicts this will result in a 10-year savings of more than $700 billion. The savings will come from reductions to Medicare Advantage, which represents a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. In additions, hospitals will be paid less if they don’t meet certain benchmarks for patient care. The law’s intent was to save money by making the system more efficient and without making reductions in benefits. So Obamacare doesn’t ""cut"" Medicare funding that already exists. Rather, it controls future spending, which politicians on both sides of the aisle called for.    The cost control ""is part of what Congress does to try to manage the insanely complex and expensive Medicare system,"" said Jay Wolfson, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. ""It is not new, nor is it partisan."" When Mark Pryor voted with the Senate to pass Obamacare in 2009, he wasn’t voting to cut Medicare. He was voting to slow its growth. The goal is to reallocate some of the money saved toward Obamacare’s goal of covering the currently uninsured, said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University health policy law professor. So the savings are designed to offset costs in Obamacare so that the law doesn’t increase the national deficit. Our ruling Cotton’s ad claimed that ""Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare."" In reality, the Affordable Care Act calls for a slowed growth of Medicare funding, not a slash to current funds. The savings from this approach will be used to offset Obamacare costs. Because the ad doesn’t make this clear, we rate Cotton’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280977ADB80>],/factchecks/2013/nov/19/tom-cotton/sen-mark-pryor-cut-medicare-pay-obamacare-says-rep/
