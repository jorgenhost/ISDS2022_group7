I’m just trying to figure out which black lives matter. It can’t be unborn black babies. They are destroyed without a second thought. It’s not black cops. They don’t seem to matter.

Giroir says labs that test livestock could ease the COVID testing backlog for people
","In a heated exchange late last month on CNN’s State of the Union, host Jake Tapper pressed Adm. Brett Giroir, the Health and Human Services assistant secretary who oversees COVID testing efforts for the Trump administration, on why the government isn’t requiring commercial labs to increase testing capacity in order to speed turnaround time. Giroir’s response described a series of steps — some unusual — being taken by the federal government. One focus was on the role veterinary labs, including those with special certification, could play in helping to build capacity. ""Five veterinary labs have their CLIA certification to officially test human patients,"" he said. ""There are a lot of labs who are doing surveillance testing that don't need the CLIA certification."" He was referring to certification under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, a federal law that sets the standard for labs that test human specimens. So that got us wondering: Can labs that test cattle, chickens or your pet Fido run tests on humans? And, if so, what role are they playing in the national pandemic, and how much is it helping? After all, the issue of expanding lab capacity will likely come up repeatedly as demand for testing increases with mounting case counts. Turnaround times at some labs have grown, with results now taking days to more than a week in some areas, frustrating consumers and public health officials. Delays for test results mean delays for contact tracing and quarantining. The administration’s pandemic response, including testing issues, is also proving to be a hot topic on the campaign trail. We reached out to HHS for more information about Giroir’s statement. An HHS spokesperson emailed a list of nine veterinary labs that have received the required certification to do patient-specific human testing, saying Giroir had been mistakenly briefed before the interview that there were only five. A U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson said there are 15 National Animal Health Laboratory Network facilities nationwide that have CLIA certification to test human samples. Clearly, there are vet labs in the U.S. with the necessary credentials, but the exact number is a matter of confusion. As for the surveillance efforts, the HHS spokesperson did not provide specific examples of veterinary labs doing such work but provided a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services FAQ saying labs that don’t have CLIA certification can do some types of surveillance if results are not given to specific patients. Our experts all quickly noted that veterinary labs — especially those that focus on food animals, including cows, pigs and chickens, have long tested for diseases, including many kinds of coronaviruses. They’re on the lookout for microbes that can affect food safety, such as salmonella or E. coli, or diseases that can devastate the animals themselves, including avian influenza, hoof and mouth disease or African swine fever. Hence, a lot of testing goes on in the 63 food-animal testing labs in 33 states and four Canadian provinces accredited by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, said its executive director, David Zeman. ""In some states, we have more capacity in the vet labs than in the public health labs,"" he added. Those vet labs, often affiliated with universities or government agencies, use highly sophisticated equipment, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, as do labs focusing on human testing. Many of the COVID tests being done are PCR, which can detect the virus’s genetic material. ""It’s the same machines, the same science,"" said Zeman. However, these are large, full-service labs that deal mainly with farm animals, different from the smaller labs generally found at your neighborhood vet. So, sorry, Fido. Earlier this year, researchers at Iowa State University found that the testing process for the new coronavirus is similar to that used to test pigs for porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus, a disease that killed thousands of piglets in 2013. Because a lot of labs had updated their equipment and processes so they could check for PED, they were in a good position to help with COVID-19 testing. Except, of course, it’s never that simple. While the science and technology are the same, the administrative requirements are not. Veterinary labs must meet standards for accreditation by such groups as the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians and are overseen by federal and state agricultural agencies. Human labs also must meet strict standards, including CLIA, and fall under the auspices of other agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One requirement is that the CLIA lab must have a director who is a medical doctor with specialized experience. Most animal labs are run by, not surprisingly, veterinarians, often ones with Ph.D.s. Some vet labs have formed partnerships with CLIA-certified labs to clear this hurdle. Still, it’s a process that can take weeks, so it’s not an overnight fix, said Zeman.  But can these labs really make a difference in the testing backlog? A June article on the American Veterinary Medicine Association website quoted an official in May saying that the then-seven CLIA-certified vet labs had the capacity to process 12,000 PCR samples with a 24-hour turnaround. Zeman said he sent out a survey in July to his 63 members in response to an HHS inquiry and found that, on average, each lab — if CLIA-certified — could process 500 to 1,000 COVID samples a day on top of what it needs to do to monitor animals. ""Multiply that by 60 some labs and you have a rough idea of what they could do,"" he said. The math adds up to at least 31,500 tests a day. Currently, more than 700,000 samples are taken daily and sent to all types of labs — mainly large commercial and hospital-based facilities, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University. The Atlantic’s COVID Tracking Project notes similar testing numbers at the end of July. More vet labs participating ""could ease the burden on these labs, but it doesn’t sound like a game changer in terms of wait times,"" said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Some vet labs are working with public health labs to ""test a specific segment of the population (university students, routine screening of government workers, etc.),"" said Michelle Forman, media manager for the Association of Public Health Laboratories in an email. ""So it’s not so much taking existing burden off of the public health labs and commercial labs but it is preventing additional burden from being put on them."" Giroir said ""lots"" of labs that are non-CLIA certified labs are helping by doing research or  surveillance, but Zeman was not aware of such efforts by such labs in his organization. Perhaps Giroir was talking about ""pooled testing,"" in which a number of specimens are tested in a batch, speculated Mark Ackermann, director of the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Corvallis, Oregon. Under that method, if any batch tests positive, individual specimens from the batch are then each tested to see who is positive.  Ackermann, whose lab has CLIA certification, pointed to another way vet labs might be helping: Many are making the liquid needed for the vials that hold the swabs taken from patients’ nasal passages. Giroir was correct in saying there are some veterinary labs helping out with COVID testing. But even if all 63 accredited food-animal vet labs in the U.S. and Canada were pressed into processing human COVID tests, an industry survey estimates it would increase capacity by between 31,500 to 63,000 samples per day. While helpful, that would still be only a small portion of the more than 700,000 daily tests being conducted, which some experts say falls short of what is needed. Additionally, while vet labs are helping in some ways, Giroir provided little evidence to back up his assertion that ""lots"" of labs that lack CLIA certification are assisting in surveillance efforts.

Sen. Bob Casey said federal agents ‘kidnapped’ protesters in Portland. Is that true?
","Democrats and civil libertarians have decried the Trump administration’s response to unrest in Portland, Ore., in recent weeks. Federal agents have been criticized for beating and pepper spraying a peaceful Navy veteran and shooting another man in the face with a nonlethal munition, fracturing his skull. When President Donald Trump threatened to send federal agents to Philadelphia, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa.) accused the officers in Portland of ""kidnapping and holding citizens without charges."" We wondered whether Casey’s description was accurate. Our analysis of this claim focuses on two detentions. A federal judge ruled one of them was unconstitutional, and a Trump administration official said agents lacked probable cause for the second. Legal experts say those seizures meet the common language definition of kidnapping, even as they stressed that the officers involved would never be charged. Federal agents don’t typically patrol American cities. But in late June, Trump signed an executive order directing federal law enforcement agencies to send personnel to cities where monuments had become focal points for protests against systemic racism and police violence. A few days later, Homeland Security agents from Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement — who didn’t have proper training in riot control or mass demonstrations — arrived in Portland to support officers of the Federal Protective Service, the division responsible for protecting federal buildings such as the city’s Mark O. Hatfield courthouse, which had been vandalized. When Casey said protesters in Portland had been kidnapped, he was relying on news reports and legal documents that described two protesters who were picked up under ""irregular"" circumstances early July 15, said Natalie Adams, Casey’s spokesperson. One is Mark Pettibone, who said he was seized near the courthouse by a group of armed agents traveling in an unmarked minivan. Pettibone told Oregon Public Broadcasting that as the van drove off, officers covered his eyes and restrained his hands. Pettibone said he was taken to a building he later learned was the federal courthouse, loaded into a cell, and read his Miranda rights. He was patted down and photographed, and his belongings were searched. Officers didn’t tell him why he was being arrested, he said, and when he declined to answer questions without a lawyer present, he was released without any record of an arrest. The details are outlined in a sworn statement and were corroborated by Connor O’Shea, a friend who was walking with Pettibone moments before he was picked up. The other incident was captured in a now-viral video. It shows a team of federal agents dressed in combat gear surrounding a peaceful protester, removing him from the street, and carrying him away in an unmarked van — just like Pettibone. The protester in the video hasn’t been identified. Legal experts said neither of these arrests was lawful because the officers lacked probable cause. When Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum sued the Trump administration, she argued that the agents who snatched Pettibone violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendments rights and that his detention constituted ""an unreasonable seizure."" Michael Mosman, the federal judge who ruled on the case, agreed. Mosman wrote: ""There is no video of this arrest and no evidence relating to its legality other than Mr. Pettibone’s sworn statements. Defendants have not refuted the state’s allegation that Mr. Pettibone’s seizure lacked probable cause. I therefore assume, only for the purposes of this opinion, that this seizure was unlawful and constituted a violation of Mr. Pettibone’s rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Regarding the arrest depicted in the video, Mosman added: ""The video shows the seizure but does not show any context for what preceded it. It therefore does not speak to probable cause one way or another because it is equally plausible that the individual was an innocent bystander or that he had committed some criminal act just before officers seized him."" But when a Trump administration official was asked to describe the probable cause, he admitted the officers had none. Rather, the agents wanted to question the man about a crime he might have observed — and believed they needed to move him to do so safely. Richard ""Kris"" Cline, deputy director of the Federal Protective Service, said at a news conference that as agents approached the man, ""they noticed that coming in their direction were violent demonstrators."" This necessitated moving the man ""to an area that was safe for both the officers and the individual,"" Cline said. Cline went on to argue that the officers’ conduct was lawful because it was not actually an arrest, but rather a stop, which does not require probable cause. Cline is wrong. Forty years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in Dunaway v. New York that taking a suspect into custody, transporting him to a new location, and detaining him for questioning is ""indistinguishable from a traditional arrest."" And for such an arrest to be lawful, probable cause is required. The court drew similar conclusions in Davis v. Mississippi and Hayes v. Florida. Harvard Law professor Andrew Crespo described the case law this way: ""Any one of these cases, standing alone, resolves the question at hand. Taken together, the conclusion is inescapable: When the agents put the man in the van, took him off the street, and brought him inside for questioning, they arrested him. Cline says they did so without probable cause. That means they violated the Constitution."" So, can these two incidents be considered kidnapping? Rosenblum used the word kidnap in her petition for an injunction against future arrests involving protesters. ""Ordinarily, a person exercising his right to walk through the streets of Portland who is confronted by anonymous men in military-type fatigues and ordered into an unmarked van can reasonably assume that he is being kidnapped and is the victim of a crime,"" Rosenblum wrote. Some legal experts didn’t hesitate when asked if what happened was kidnapping. ""Apprehending a person by force and holding him or her in captivity without legal authority is the definition of kidnapping,"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert and the dean at Berkeley Law. ""That is exactly what was done to some who were apprehended in Portland."" Former federal prosecutor Ken White, an outspoken legal commentator on Twitter who goes by @popehat, said calling the detentions kidnapping is a mostly rhetorical question rather than a legal one because it’s unlikely the agents responsible would ever be charged. But he didn’t dispute that some elements of the crime of kidnapping match what happened to Pettibone and the other protester. ""The arrest could certainly be unlawful and in violation of the Fourth Amendment, which has consequences in any criminal case against the arrestee and potential civil consequences if the arrestee sues,"" he said. ""However, kidnapping is a different matter — that’s a criminal allegation against the cop."" He continued: ""The crime of kidnapping usually has an element of wrongful intent — so you’d have to prove not just that the arrest was unlawful, but that the cop knew and intended it to be unlawful, which is difficult."" George Washington University Law’s Jonathan Turley said it was ""reckless"" for Casey to call the incidents kidnapping when the seizures were most likely false arrests, which can occur when an officer believes, even wrongly, that he had legal authority to detain someone. Casey said federal agents in Portland have been ""kidnapping and holding citizens without charges."" It’s clear from Mosman’s ruling and from Cline’s remarks that the two detentions in question were unconstitutional or false, and it’s not in dispute that the two men were briefly held without charges. The circumstances of these two detentions fit many elements of the crime of kidnapping. This is true even if the crime is never charged or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. For these reasons, we rate Casey’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/aug/04/bob-casey/sen-bob-casey-said-federal-agents-kidnapped-protes/

Fact-checking Chuck Schumer’s claim that Republican bill says ‘no medical malpractice suits’
","Sen. Chuck Schumer rejected a coronavirus relief bill proposed by Republicans in the Senate, calling it extreme and ""a giveaway to corporate interests."" Schumer said the proposal focused on protecting businesses, schools and hospitals from liability. ""You know what's in this bill? No medical malpractice suits until 2024, even if they're not COVID-related,"" said Schumer in a July 28 interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. ""What it says is, if a employer—"" ""Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, really?"" Hayes asked. ""That's in the bill, yes,"" Schumer said. ""It's in the bill. It's amazing."" Is that true? PolitiFact examined the bill and asked law professors for their review of it to determine if any aspect of the bill did what Schumer claimed. What Schumer said was ""in the bill"" is not actually in the bill. The bill does not explicitly ban the filing of lawsuits until 2024. Language does, however, make cases more difficult to succeed, experts said. Does the bill extend to non-COVID-19 related cases? ""It doesn't seem that it's intended to apply to medical malpractice suits that don't relate to non-COVID-19 related care,"" said via email Michelle M. Mello, a law professor at Stanford Law School. But certain definitions and wording in the bill support Schumer’s interpretation, she said. Schumer’s claim is based on a bill introduced by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that’s part of a package promoted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. McConnell has argued that the bill does not provide immunity from lawsuits and that it still allows for accountability for gross negligence and intentional misconduct. The bill would extend to health care services provided from December 2019 to October 2024, or the date when the national emergency over the coronavirus ends. A spokesperson for Schumer said that while the bill cites ""coronavirus-related medical liability action,"" it also gives a broad definition of what constitutes as ""coronavirus-related health care services."" Here’s how the bill defines coronavirus-related health care services: ""the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of coronavirus;"" ""the assessment or care of an individual with a confirmed or suspected case of coronavirus; or"" ""the care of any individual who is admitted to, presents to, receives services from, or resides at, a health care provider for any purpose during the period of a federal emergency declaration concerning coronavirus, if such provider’s decisions or activities with respect to such individual are impacted as a result of coronavirus."" The ""for any purpose"" phrase in that definition ""would enable the preemption"" of medical malpractice lawsuits even if the health care services are not directly related to COVID-19, said Justin Goodman, a spokesperson for Schumer. ""Because the provider can be expected to say that the pandemic impacted their decisions and activities for all services they provided,"" he said. Mello, of Stanford Law School, offered this scenario: ""Suppose I come to a hospital clinic for chemotherapy, and the hospital is so overwhelmed and distracted with its COVID care and surge preparations that they don't staff the chemo service at normal levels and something important gets missed in my care — the hospital could argue that my injury fits the definition."" The hospital could say that care was suboptimal because it had diverted resources and attention to COVID-19, Mello added. Drew Brandewie, a spokesperson for Cornyn, argued that the ""for any purpose"" wording in the bill is irrelevant to Schumer’s claim. ""Nothing in the bill, including that provision, preempts or bars a lawsuit from being filed — which is what Sen. Schumer said,"" Brandewie said. Law experts said there were provisions in the bill that could reduce the number of suits filed, including a standard for negligence that’s higher than what state laws commonly require. ""The bill only permits liability for the most egregious misconduct,"" said David C. Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown Law. Plaintiffs would have to prove that a health care provider intended to hurt them, he said. In the evidence-gathering process, people seeking to sue must also show that information requested from a health care provider ""equals or exceeds the burden or cost"" placed on the health care provider. That provision and the one-year limit for filing claims, can also challenge a plaintiff's ability to file claims, experts said. When Cornyn introduced his bill, he said that as states reopen, health care workers, businesses, and schools faced ""a second pandemic of frivolous lawsuits threatening to bankrupt them."" What might be the effect of his bill if it becomes law? There would be extremely few COVID-19-based medical malpractice lawsuits and nearly zero frivolous ones, said Charles M. Silver, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who has studied medical malpractice litigation in Texas. ""The impact of the bill will be to prevent the few plaintiffs with very strong negligence claims from collecting compensation,"" Silver said. Silver disagreed with Cornyn’s premise that health care providers were getting lots of frivolous lawsuits. Medical malpractice lawsuits are expensive and hard to win, even when clients have strong claims, Silver said. ""The single most validated finding about medical malpractice litigation is that the system routinely sends victims with valid claims home empty-handed or, at least, under-compensated,"" Silver said. Schumer said of a Republican coronavirus relief bill, ""You know what’s in this bill? No medical malpractice suits until 2024, even if they’re not COVID related."" Schumer was imprecise and inaccurate describing a provision in the bill. Despite what Schumer said, the bill does not prohibit the filing of medical malpractice lawsuits. It does set strict standards that must be met for a case to succeed. The standards also could restrict the number of cases filed, experts said. Regarding the bill's impact on lawsuits not related to COVID-19 care, some experts say the language is broad enough to have a chilling effect on all types of medical malpractice lawsuits.  Schumer’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Esshaki campaign misrepresents Haley Stevens’ stance on health care
","Republican Eric Esshaki, a former nurse, is vying to unseat incumbent Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Rochester Hills, in Michigan's 11th congressional district, which she flipped from red to blue in 2018. In an ad, Esshaki attacks Stevens on health care, promising to stop her plan for ""socialized medicine."" ""She’d eliminate 100,000 doctors and nurses,"" the ad says. The evidence Essahaki’s campaign cites comes from a report funded by a group lobbying against Medicare for All that makes problematic assumptions to support its analysis. While some progressive Democrats are pushing for a single-payer system to replace private insurance, others are calling for a public option, a government-sponsored program that would be available alongside private plans through the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges. Stevens has publicly been on both sides of this divide, but her latest position is in favor of the public option. At the time Esshaki’s campaign produced the ad, Stevens had already moved away from Medicare for All, campaigning instead on a public option. Although her stance on Medicare for All has shifted over time, she told PolitiFact Michigan she does not support Medicare for All. What’s the difference between Medicare for All and a public option? Medicare for All would create a single, national health insurance plan supported by payroll taxes that would cover every American, mostly eliminating private health insurance. Under public option proposals, by contrast, Americans would have the choice of a government health plan in addition to private insurance options. Some critics argue this would inevitably lead to a single-payer national system if private insurers aren’t able to compete with the government’s prices and quality. But advocates of a public option have differing ideas of the role it would play in the health care system. Those who support a modest version envision the public plan as a kind of last resort for those who cannot find affordable private insurance, while others see it as a transitional step toward Medicare for All. Would Stevens’ health care plan eliminate 100,000 doctors and nurses? Esshaki bases his claim that Stevens’ health care plan would eliminate 100,000 doctors and nurses on a report published this year by FTI Consulting, a global consulting firm with offices around the world, that projects a loss of nearly 45,000 physicians and 1.2 million nurses by 2050 under Medicare for All. The report was funded by Partnership for America’s Health Care Future (PAHCF), a group of medical professionals, hospitals, health insurers and pharmaceutical companies lobbying against Medicare for All and public option proposals. The report notes that countries where physicians are paid more have more physicians. The FTI analysis then assumes that Medicare payment rates would remain constant under Medicare for All, and looks at how a decline in incomes would affect the supply of physicians in the U.S. But ""the relationship between physician salaries and physician supply is an association and not necessarily causal"" warns Joelle Abramowitz, a University of Michigan economist. Meanwhile, ""the calculation assumes that all other components of Medicare as it is currently implemented for seniors will remain the same under Medicare for All, which is likely not the case,"" Abramowitz said. Esshaki’s campaign shared another report with PolitiFact Michigan that found that a public option would eliminate the jobs of 420,000 health care employees. This report was also funded by PAHCF and assumes that a public option would reimburse health care providers at current Medicare rates. It does not specify how many doctors and nurses are included in this figure. Robert Pollin, an economist at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst told Kaiser Health News that Medicare for All would entail significant job losses. ""Every proponent of Medicare for All — including myself — has to recognize that the biggest source of cost-saving is layoffs,"" he said. But experts predict most of the job losses under Medicare for All would be in the health insurance industry, such as insurance brokers, medical billing workers and other administrative roles. Some argue that Medicare for All, by decreasing the number of uninsured Americans, would increase demand for health care providers, including doctors, physician assistants and nurses. Stevens supports a public option over Medicare for All  During her 2018 campaign, Stevens advocated for Medicare for All. In a June 2018 tweet she wrote, ""Medicare for all. NOW."" That same month, during a candidate forum, the former Obama administration official said, ""We absolutely need to propose legislation to provide Medicare for All."" This did not remain her position for long. A month before she won her seat, BuzzFeed reported Stevens supports a voluntary public option instead of Medicare for All. In a debate days before she was elected, Stevens said, ""I think that Medicare for All is a place where we can grow and go into, but for right now we need to focus on the cost of prescription drugs.""

Trump inflates insulin help for seniors
","President Donald Trump sometimes speaks as if a hoped-for result is the same as a done-deal. A day after he signed an executive order on insulin at the end of July, he took a victory lap on Twitter. ""Nothing like this has ever been done before because Big Pharma, with its vast power, would not let it happen,"" he said in his July 25 tweet. ""Expensive insulin went from big dollars to virtual pennies.""  ...to virtual pennies. Epi-pens went from their incredibly high, jacked up prices, to lower than their original give away bargains. Biggest price reductions in history, by far! Nothing like this has ever for our citizens, especially our Seniors. REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT! ""Biggest price reductions in history, by far!"" Trump continued. ""Nothing like this has ever (happened) for our citizens, especially our Seniors. REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT!"" If words matter, Trump’s manner of talking about the future as if it were already in the past clearly runs afoul of the facts. But there’s a more subtle effect in play. He presents his move on insulin as a boon to diabetics in general. But the scope of his executive order is more limited than he presents. The most recent pricing trends, made available to PolitiFact with help from the Schaeffer Center at the University of Southern California, provides a bigger picture that reveals some encouraging news and some stubborn problems. Trump’s order targeted a select group of health care providers, Federally Qualified Health Centers. These centers serve people of limited means, focusing on rural and low-income communities. The gist of Trump’s order, a Health and Human Service Department spokesperson told us, requires these centers ""to provide these drugs to medically underserved patients at close to acquisition cost."" That cost, HHS said, is ""very low,"" but the department isn’t allowed to give the exact number. We note that it would take several months to implement this policy as it wends its way through the rulemaking process. But the substance of the measure doesn’t match Trump’s soaring rhetoric. There are over 1,300 of these health centers. That’s a lot, but in terms of the particular federal drug discount program that they use to buy insulin — something called the 340B program — they represent less than a fifth of the 340B participating clinics and hospitals nationwide. And out of all operations that contract with the program, which includes individual pharmacies, these clinics represent less than 2%. So the executive order affects only a slice of providers, and it hinges on the 340B drug program.  That program itself doesn’t dominate the drug marketplace. Details on insulin sales through the program are lacking, but looking at all prescription drug sales, the program represents about 8% to 10% of the overall market. ""It doesn't help most Americans with their out-of-pocket prices,"" said Vanderbilt University health policy professor Stacie Dusetzina. Further limiting the potential impact of Trump’s order on patients’ costs, these Federally Qualified Health Centers have a good reputation of passing along the discounts they get from the government’s 340B program to their patients. These health centers charge people on a sliding scale. That led drug policy researcher Karen Schwartz with the Kaiser Family Foundation to question the reach of this executive order. ""Most patients likely would still have been protected by the sliding fee scale without this change,"" Schwartz tweeted July 24.  Trump targeted seniors in his tweet, and it’s worth looking at the insulin prices they, as well as other diabetics, have faced on his watch. It’s important to note that with prescription drugs, the price isn’t the price. There’s a list price, but what someone actually pays depends on drug maker discounts and rebates given to drug distribution intermediaries, a person’s insurance plan (if they have one) and where they stand with their deductibles and copays. According to the drug research firm IQVIA, insulin copays generally rose from 2017 to 2018. That was particularly true for those on Medicare who saw their costs go up by about 10%. That took place even as some insulin prices declined or leveled off. It turns out that in the world of prescription drugs, there’s no guaranteed link between trends in prices and what patients pay out of their own pockets. Researchers at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center culled the latest numbers for six of the most common insulin products. They found that looking at the list prices — the initial price set by the manufacturer — half of the drugs generally held steady, and half showed moderate increases between 2017 and 2020. The leveling off of list prices after years of steep increases seems to be driven by public pressure. Some leading drug makers reduced prices on some insulin products on their own. ""The timing does coincide with greater attention to the ‘high cost of insulin’ issue in the media and among policy makers,"" Schaeffer Center fellow and project executive director Karen Van Nuys said. List prices matter to anyone who has to pay the difference between what they are charged and what the insurance company will pay. ""High list prices harm those without insurance, and those who are insured but are in the deductible phase or pay coinsurance for their medications,"" said Van Nuys. Prices after discounts and rebates to the firms that are part of the drug sales chain (net prices) showed a different pattern. Some drug prices fell dramatically. The ones that fell the fastest, Lantus and Levemir, started declining in 2015, two years before Trump took office. For three of the other drugs, prices remained about the same, or fell a bit.  The IQVIA report suggested that several Trump administration policies could help in the months ahead, including a move that would cap copays for some Medicare beneficiaries. The impact on Medicare recipients remains to be seen. An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, along with one published in the New England Journal of Medicine, note that the reach would be limited. Right now, publicly available data doesn’t show that patients are better off. ""The truth is that patients who need drugs like insulin are having a hard time affording them, particularly for the many who are now uninsured,"" said Vanderbilit’s Dusetzina. Trump said that his executive order had produced a steep drop in the price of insulin, and urged seniors to take note. No one can predict what the future will bring, but setting that aside, Trump’s move focused on a limited slice of the insulin market. His executive order touched less than 20% of the clinics that might provide insulin through a key government drug discount program. That drug program itself represents perhaps 10% of the total prescription drug market. The latest market analysis shows that between 2017 and 2018, insulin copays for seniors rose by about 10%. Trump’s efforts to make insulin more affordable for seniors may have helped some, but have yet to prove themselves.

Trump: Clinton promised to add 200K jobs to upstate New York, but 'they lost so many jobs'
","Donald Trump charged Hillary Clinton with ""doing nothing"" for 26 years at a campaign stop in Florida, highlighting a jobs pledge she made during her 2000 Senate campaign. ""She promised, running for the Senate years ago, 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. It was a disaster,"" Trump said Sept. 27 in Melbourne, Fla. ""Not only didn’t they come, but they lost so many jobs and you have it see it now. It’s so sad when you see what’s happened to upstate New York. It is a disaster."" During her 2000 Senate race against Republican Rick Lazio, Clinton ran ads that said, ""Hillary has a plan to create 200,000 jobs."" She also made the promise campaigning in the region, according to news reports from the time. Clinton, of course, won the race and went on to serve eight years before being named secretary of state. But did she deliver on her promise? The Trump campaign referred us to a Washington Post analysis of Clinton’s pledge. The story concluded that her efforts fell flat, but it doesn’t say the area lost jobs, either. The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, forwarded us numbers compiled using data from New York’s Labor Department. By this count, upstate New York added about 100,000 jobs from the year before Clinton’s first year in the Senate (2000) to her last year (2008).   It’s worth noting, though, that this tally counts all jobs, including those in state and local government. The Clinton camp is also counting the Hudson Valley region, which includes five counties that the state government does not consider to be upstate New York. Furthermore, the data comes from a sample survey of unemployment that locates a job based on where someone lives rather than where the job is based. For example, a Westchester County resident who works in New York City government would be counted as employed in upstate New York by the Clinton camp’s tally. If we look at just private-sector jobs and a universal count that locates a job based on where it actually is, upstate New York’s net gain in jobs is less impressive. We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ quarterly census of employment and wages, and three different definitions of upstate New York. In the broadest sense, the region refers to everywhere in the state but New York City and Long Island. Another definition also excludes Westchester County in the Hudson Valley. And a third, the one used by the state government, pinches off four more downstate counties. No matter how you slice and dice the state, Trump is right that Clinton didn’t meet her jobs target in the private sector. And his claim that the region actually lost jobs is accurate for the two stricter definitions.  Folding in public-sector jobs, Trump is still right that Clinton failed to live up to her pledge, but he’s wrong that the region lost jobs. By all three definitions of upstate New York, the area actually added jobs, though not nearly as many as Clinton promised.    Upstate New York didn’t make as strong of a recovery from the 2000 recession as the rest of the state or the country overall. During Clinton’s Senate tenure and before the 2008 recession hit, New York state gained about 134,000 jobs (85,000 in the private sector) while the country added almost 5 million jobs (3 million in the private sector).  ""The Clinton campaign proposal to create 200,000 jobs appears to be pulled from thin air, not backed up by any calculation or details related to any particular policy proposal,"" said E.J. McMahon, research director of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think bank in Albany.   David Shaffer, former president of the Albany-based Public Policy Institute, told the Washington Post that the 200,000 jobs goal was unrealistic, but ""to her credit,"" Clinton did try. In her first year as senator, Clinton introduced a number of bills intended to spur jobs creation in the state, such as enacting a small business tax credit, updating technology infrastructure, providing financial and training assistance for local businesses and entrepreneurs. None of these proposals went anywhere. She tried again a few years later, but again to no avail.   In her 2006 re-election campaign and her 2008 bid for the White House, Clinton said she couldn’t deliver because of opposition from the Bush administration and a Republican Congress. ""When I made the pledge, I was counting on having a Democratic White House, a Democratic president, who shared my values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for everyone and to create shared prosperity,"" she said in 2008. She continued, ""And as you know, despite the difficulties of the Bush administration and a Republican Congress for six years of my first term, I have worked very hard to create jobs, but obviously as president I will have a lot more tools at my disposal."" Our ruling Trump said Clinton ""promised, running for the Senate years ago, 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. ... Not only didn't they come, but they lost so many jobs."" Trump is right that Clinton failed to bring 200,000 jobs to upstate New York, whether you’re counting all jobs or just jobs in the private sector. His claim that the region actually lost jobs is accurate for private-sector jobs. But looking at the total employment picture, the region actually added between 3,800 and 52,000 jobs depending on how you define upstate New York.

Limited data support Gina Raimondo's claim that motorists save when illegal immigrants get licenses
","In the battle over how to deal with immigrants who are in the United States illegally, one skirmish involves the question of whether those immigrants should be allowed to have a driver's license. Rhode Island is one state wrestling with the issue, and during a Sept. 28 interview with Gov. Gina Raimondo, WJAR-TV anchorman Dan Jaehnig conveyed a viewer question challenging Raimondo's support for immigrant licenses. ""There's actually many, many people who are in favor of that and many against,"" Raimondo said. ""The reason I support it, as more than a dozen states already have it, is, to me, it's a public safety issue. I want everybody on the roads of Rhode Island to have a license. And I want everybody, if they're in an accident, to have a license and insurance. When you see that, actually, in other states their insurance premiums for everybody have gone down. That's why I'm a supporter of it."" We wondered whether Raimondo was correct that states that have granted licenses to illegal immigrants have seen automobile insurance premiums decrease for everyone. James Lynch, chief actuary for the Insurance Information Institute, an educational organization financed by the insurance industry, said he's never seen any definitive studies to prove or disprove the idea. ""There is a logic behind that, though,"" he said. If allowing undocumented immigrants to get a license and requiring them to have insurance produces a big drop in the percentage of uninsured motorists, ""that would reduce the uninsured motorist premium."" But so many factors go into adjusting rates ""it would be difficult to pinpoint it and say that's what's going on"" if rates drop in a state that allows undocumented immigrants to get a license, Lynch said. Benefit of $17 per policy? Raimondo's office subsequently referred us to a 2015 study published in the Southern Economic Journal. It didn't directly look at whether insurance rates go down when licenses are granted, but it tried to estimate the costs of denying licenses to undocumented immigrants. Using data covering 14 years from 41 states, the authors estimated that denying licenses to people in the country illegally adds $17.22 to an insurance bill. To put that in perspective, the average automobile insurance policy in the United States in 2013 cost $841.23 per year, according to the latest data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A savings of $17.22 would amount to a 2 percent drop. (It would be about 1.6 percent in Rhode Island where the average policy cost $1,066, the eighth highest in the nation.) But that's far from a firm number, said co-author Kenneth Jameson, professor emeritus at the University of Utah economics department. It will vary by state, and ""the main factor is the share of undocumented immigrants in the total population,"" he said. Another driver of savings, if any, will be the median age of the immigrants getting licenses and insurance. Adding younger drivers bumps up insurance costs because young adults are more likely to get into accidents. But Raimondo's claim ""is consistent with what our data would suggest,"" said Jameson. ""Our results suggest that insurance rates should be dampened in the 10 states that are newly allowing undocumented to drive legally,"" Jameson and his colleague write. ""In a few years, a new empirical investigation can ascertain whether, over time, the new wave of legalizing undocumented driving has held down insurance costs in the liberalizing states."" Other estimates  Another analysis was done by the Colorado Fiscal Institute, which supports letting illegal immigrants get a license. It estimated last year that the state's drivers could see a $29.5 million savings in insurance premiums each year once the law was fully funded. That would be $7.70 per motorist saved per year. And in 2007 when Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced that New York would begin issuing driver's licenses without regard to immigration status, the state's Department of Insurance was estimating that the change would save drivers $120 million per year because costs associated with uninsured motorists would drop by 34 percent. With roughly 11.6 million drivers, that would be a savings of about $10 for each driver each year. (However, Spitzer never implemented the policy.) Although there's uncertainty in the estimates of how much is saved by letting illegal immigrants get licenses and insurance, there's firmer data on how it affects the number of uninsured drivers. According to the Colorado Fiscal Institute, in New Mexico the ratio of uninsured vehicles on the road dropped from 33 percent in 2002 to 9.1 percent in 2011. And the National Immigration Law Center reported in 2008 that when Utah changed its policy in 1999, its rate of uninsured motorists, which was 10 percent in 1998, had fallen to 5.1 percent in 2007. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists 12 states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Vermont and Washington — along with the District of Columbia that issue licenses to unauthorized immigrants. Our ruling Raimondo said that in states where illegal immigrants have been allowed to get driver's licenses, the ""insurance premiums for everybody have gone down."" The few studies that have been done have estimated that there is a savings. In addition, the experts we spoke with also say there's good reason to believe that the savings, albeit small, will be real. But the research on this is scattered and far from definitive. As such, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/07/gina-raimondo/limited-data-support-gina-raimondos-claim-motorist/

State Department under Hillary Clinton refused security requests for Benghazi, Paul Ryan says
","The Sept. 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, have spurred numerous Republican allegations against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. GOP nominee Donald Trump went so far as to say the Benghazi victims were ""left helpless to die"" as Clinton, then the secretary of state, ""soundly slept in her bed."" That earned a False from PolitiFact National. Congressional investigations did not find Clinton was inattentive, much less asleep. Rather, she worked into the night after the attacks occurred. Several days after that fact check was published, the sister of Christopher Stephens, the slain ambassador, said she did not blame Clinton. But Patricia Smith, the mother of one of the other victims, has blamed Clinton. And Clinton, in part because of her ""What difference does it make?"" remark on the attacks, continues to be a target. House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted this on Sept. 26, 2016, a couple of weeks after the fourth anniversary of the attacks: ""Repeated requests for additional security in #Benghazi were routinely denied by Secretary Clinton's State Dept."" In contrast to Trump, the Wisconsin Republican didn’t go quite as personal -- referring to Clinton’s State Department, rather than Clinton herself. That helps his claim. Prior fact check In May 2014, ahead of one of the congressional investigations into the Benghazi attacks, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed the State Department ""not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya."" Our rating was True. As we noted in that article: ""There are disagreements about whether State acted reasonably, but that it didn't honor requests for additional security is established fact,"" said Georgetown University adjunct assistant professor Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which focuses on foreign policy and national security.   The State Department has acknowledged it rejected requests to provide more security personnel in Libya. It also acknowledged rejecting a request to erect guard towers at the Benghazi mission, but notes that a number of physical security upgrades, such as the installation of concrete barriers to block unused gates, were made during 2012. The State Department’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks was inadequate ""despite repeated requests"" from the Benghazi mission and the embassy in Tripoli for additional staffing. In addition, PolitiFact National has reported that the numerous requests from officials on the ground in Libya for better security for the Benghazi compound are undeniable and well-documented. It’s worth noting, though, that our colleagues have also pointed out there is no evidence that Clinton herself was aware of the requests, or that she willfully denied them. Our rating Ryan said: ""Repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied"" by Hillary ""Clinton's State Department."" Ryan’s claim avoids trouble by focusing on the State Department, then led by Clinton, rather than on Clinton herself. It’s well documented that the department didn’t honor requests for more security prior to the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans.

Claim Loretta Sanchez ‘passed one bill in 20 years’: Technically correct, but misleading
"," California’s U.S. Senate candidates Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez attacked one another’s records, or lack thereof, during Wednesday’s debate in Los Angeles. Harris is California’s attorney general. Sanchez is an Orange County congresswoman. They are competing to replace retiring U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. All three are Democrats. One claim by Harris on Sanchez’s Capitol Hill tenure stood out: ""My opponent has passed one bill in her 20 years in Congress, and that was to rename a post office."" We decided to check this provocative claim, and whether any context was missing. Our research To back up the statement, Harris’ campaign pointed to Sanchez’ record at congress.gov, the official website for federal legislative information. It shows Sanchez has, indeed, sponsored only one bill that became law: A 2001 measure to rename an Orange County Post Office. It also shows Sanchez has co-sponsored 179 bills that have become law. Bills are often co-sponsored by dozens of members of Congress at the same time. Sanchez responded during the debate: ""It’s pretty obvious to me that my opponent doesn’t understand the Congress at all,"" Sanchez said. ""You don't pass a bill on its own necessarily in the Congress; you pass it by putting it into bills."" Sanchez has a point: A search on congress.gov shows some of her colleagues, even some who have served longer than Sanchez, have introduced only a handful of bills that became law. Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters of Los Angeles, for example, has served since 1991 and sponsored only three bills that became law. Even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has served since 1987, sponsored only seven bills that became law. Pelosi has, however, co-sponsored more than 400 measures now on the books. In an article after the debate, the Los Angeles Times described the issue this way: ""Relative to the number of bills that are filed, few actually pass as standalone legislation and become law. Members often insert legislation into broader bills in hopes of increasing chances it will pass. In fact, many of the day-to-day bills that do pass are to rename post offices — because they are not controversial. Attacks about the naming of post offices have been a staple of congressional debates across the country, especially as Congress has done less and less actual legislating in recent years."" Sanchez’s military bills During the debate, Sanchez claimed she’s placed ""17 different pieces of legislation into one bill"" under the National Defense Authorization Act. The McClatchy news service reported in March that Sanchez ""has been successful at getting her amendments into the National Defense Authorization Act, the sprawling budget that sets policy for the Department of Defense."" It added that Greg Jacob, former policy director of the Service Women’s Action Network, said his group often went to Sanchez for assistance in fighting the epidemic of sexual assault in the military. ""Congresswoman Sanchez has always been at the leading edge of the fight in regard to this issue,"" Jacob, a Marine Corps combat veteran who closely tracked her work on the Armed Services Committee, told McClatchy. This is not the first time an opponent has attacked Sanchez’s legislative record. Van Tran, who challenged the congresswoman in the 2010 House race, criticized Sanchez ""for getting only a single bill passed during her time in Congress, a measure to name a post office in Santa Ana."" Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris claimed her opponent Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez ""has passed one bill in her 20 years in office, and that was to rename a post office."" That’s technically correct. But it ignores the fact that relatively few standalone bills introduced by members of Congress are passed on their own. Many are added as amendments to larger bills. Long-time Democratic House members Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi have sponsored a combined 10 bills that became law during their careers. Sanchez has co-sponsored nearly 180 bills. And she’s been praised for successfully introducing policy bills that were later included in the nation’s military budget. There’s technical truth to Harris’ statement. But it takes things out of context and leaves the wrong impression that Sanchez has done next to nothing on Capitol Hill. We rate Harris' claim Half True.

"['Nevada', 'Candidate Biography', 'Lesley Cohen']","
Nevada Assemblyman accused of appearing in fetish film, stalking, but context needed
","Political attack ads typically stick to the same ol’ stuff, like voting records and candidate positions. That can’t be said for the jabs in Henderson, Nev., where voters in one state Assembly district are getting smacked with attacks on a pornographic level. Democratic Assembly candidate Lesley Cohen is spreading several campaign mail pieces accusing her opponent, incumbent Republican Stephen Silberkraus, of appearing in a ""fetish film"" and stalking women. ""It’s bad enough that Silberkraus appeared in a sexual fetish film where women were kidnapped from their homes and forced to live naked in kennels and trained to be pets,"" it reads. ""But when Silberkraus isn’t acting in films that degrade women, he’s stalking them in his personal time."" It’s certainly not a standard political attack line, but is there any truth to it? Silberkraus did appear in a fetish film, but there’s more to it than the ad lets on — and the claim about stalking is even further from the truth. Film career Under the stage name of Stephen Neill, Silberkraus appeared as an extra in dozens of television shows, including The West Wing, Entourage, CSI, Power Rangers and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with a film career spanning from the 1990s to the mid 2000s. The film cited in the mailer is called The Pet, a poorly received 2006 exploitation film based on the concepts of ""human pets"" and sexual slavery. ""A young woman in dire financial straights accepts an offer to be a wealthy aristocrat's human ‘pet’ for six months,"" the plot summary reads. ""Then ruthless modern ‘pet-nappers’ kidnap the woman to sell her on the GSM, "" referring to the ""Global Slave Market."" Silberkraus appears briefly in the film as a trader on this market, and delivers a handful of lines in about 30 seconds of screen time. Reached by PolitiFact, the Republican Assemblyman said he was on set for one day to film his scene, and was at the time assuming that the film would be a more serious look at human trafficking. He called the finished product a ""cheesy B-movie"" and disparaged Cohen for propagating a ""ridiculous political ploy"" unrelated to the campaign. ""An extra has about as much influence on a production as a fly has on growing a tree,"" he said. ""They have no real say, they’re just there."" Lynn Comella, a UNLV gender and sexuality studies professor, said use of the term ""fetish film"" seemed politically charged. Comella said in an email that she didn’t watch the film, but that the somewhat convoluted plot touched on a number of sexual fetishes and serious issues such as animal roleplay, human trafficking and organ harvesting. ""I don't think it's necessarily wrong to describe it as a fetish film, but it's clear that this word is being used to pack a political punch,"" she said in an email. ""It's clear that they are attempting to establish some kind of connection between this person's appearance in a fetish film — if we want to call it that — and stalking, which is specious at best."" Stalking The campaign mail cites an article from NewsMaxTV Las Vegas, an online news site run by Republican political operative Rob Lauer. Lauer is known for an unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state and having his home searched by police in 2015 as part of a wide-ranging extortion investigation into a Nevada Assemblyman. The article claims Silberkraus was detained by police in handcuffs for ""stalking"" his primary opponent. But Silberkraus was never charged with or convicted of stalking. Las Vegas police said they had no records on file for an arrest or any incident involving Silberkraus, and a search of national and local court document sites revealed nothing filed against Silberkraus.   The stalking claim originates with three-time state Assembly candidate Amy Groves, who most recently lost a June 2016 Republican primary contest to Silberkraus by 253 votes. Groves told PolitiFact that she called police after seeing Silberkraus taking pictures of a home she owns outside the Assembly district where she had filed to run. Silberkraus said he was attempting to collect evidence that Groves lived in that home outside the district, which would disqualify her from running. A handful of legislative candidates have been removed from the ballot in recent years after their opponents were able to prove that they didn’t live in the district. Groves said she felt threatened because as a realtor, she was often responsible for evicting residents or overseeing collections, and said she felt threatened enough to call the police. ""We really panicked because it’s a real threat in my industry,"" she said. Groves’ husband blocked in Silberkraus’ vehicle with his own car, and police questioned him for several minutes before letting him go. Silberkraus said he never felt like he was being detained, and that the photo in the ad was cropped to make it look like he was handcuffed. ""I’ve never been handcuffed in my life,"" he said. Regardless, police have no arrest record or any record of Silberkraus being detained, and Groves said she didn’t keep copies of any paperwork she filed with police about the incident. Our ruling A campaign mailer in a competitive Nevada Assembly race accuses Silberkraus of appearing in a ""sexual fetish film"" and being detained for ""stalking."" Silberkraus did appear briefly as an extra in a 2006 movie that centered around a myriad of sexual fetishes. He says he doesn’t agree with the film’s message. The stalking allegation holds less water, stemming from a primary opponent who accused him of stalking her several years ago. No official record exists, and he was not arrested. The claim contains an element of truth but distorts facts to create an inaccurate impression.

Did Maggie Hassan raise tuition, making New Hampshire the highest in the country?
","Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan has made college affordability a central part of her campaign for U.S. Senate, and she often notes that New Hampshire’s university system froze tuition for the first time in 25 years under her administration in stump speeches. But Republicans are now trying to use Hassan’s higher education record against her as she tries to unseat U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, in the November election. A few days ago, we fact-checked a claim, made in a National Republican Senatorial Committee television ad, that Hassan had skipped out on most University System of New Hampshire meetings. We found that claim to be Mostly True. That ad also included the claim that Hassan had ""raised tuition, making it the highest in America."" Our readers asked us: is that true? PolitiFact decided to take a look. We reached out to the NRSC, which pointed to an executive order issued by Gov. Hassan in November of 2014. That order rescinded $3 million in state funding for the USNH, which oversees the University of New Hampshire, Keene State College, Plymouth State College, and Granite State College. The take-back came in the midst of a budget crunch and was applied during the fiscal year ending in 2015, or the 2014-15 school year. That one-time $3 million take-back didn’t result in an immediate tuition increase. University leaders looked to the following state budget for enough funding to continue an ongoing tuition freeze. Among the things The NRSC pointed to were comments made by UNH president Mark Huddleston in an Associated Press article saying that tuition was a ""straight-line function of how New Hampshire invests."" So let’s look at how New Hampshire funds higher education through the state budget. During the 2009-10 and 2010-11 school years, the university system received $100 million annually from the state. But a Legislature led by then-House Speaker Bill O’Brien, a Republican, slashed funding basically in half, allocating $51 million and $54 million for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years. After the cuts, the university system announced a nearly 10 percent increase in tuition. Hassan then took office in 2013 and oversaw a partial restoration in funding, with the university system receiving $69 million and $84 million in the state budget for the following two school years. In return, USNH trustees agreed to a two-year tuition freeze covering the 2013-14 and 2014-15 academic years. In September 2014, USNH leaders promised to continue that freeze for another two years if the Legislature and governor approved a budget that included $100 million in state aid to the system in fiscal year 2016 and $105 million in fiscal year 2017, restoring it to pre-O’Brien levels. After the $3 million take-back was announced in November 2014, the USNH did not change its budget request -- suggesting it didn’t play a very important role. So what happened during the budget process? Hassan proposed USNH receive $87 million in 2016 and $94 million in 2017. USNH responded with a statement saying the proposed budget was ""insufficient to continue the tuition freeze."" University system leaders later scaled back their request, asking for $90 million in 2016 and $95 million in 2017. A Republican-controlled House ultimately approved a budget that provided $19 million less than Hassan had requested -- $81 million in both 2016 and 2017. That’s when the university system announced it would be raising tuition. In other words, during Hassan’s first budget, funding was restored enough for the university system to freeze tuition for two years. In the following budget years, state aid fell short of what USNH leaders said they needed to continue a freeze. It is also important to note that while state aid plays an important role in setting tuition, it is not the Legislature nor the Governor who set tuition rates for the USNH. It is the Board of Trustees. As governor, Hassan sits on that board, and, like governors before her, has missed most of the trustees’ meetings. Perhaps symbolically, the one meeting on June 28, 2013 that she participated in, she made the motion to freeze tuition at the university system. But had she attended other meetings and voted against raising tuition on June 26, 2015, when the board approved the hikes, she still wouldn’t have been able to swing the vote the other way. And while USNH leaders like to say that state aid in practice determines tuition rates, there’s probably some wiggle room. ""The loss of state appropriations does not fully explain the increases to the cost of public higher education in New Hampshire. Between 2003 and 2011, average tuition rates within the University System rose nearly 40 percent – even with tuition rates adjusted for inflation ... During the same time period, state appropriations per full-time equivalent student decreased by less than 12 percent,"" according to A New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies report from 2014 analyzed public higher education spending in New Hampshire. Highest in the nation? The NRSC also pointed to a College Board report that said New Hampshire had the highest in-state tuition for four-year institutions in the country in the 2015-2016 year. That’s correct, but New Hampshire’s public college affordability crisis predates Hassan’s tenure as governor. When she took office in January 2013, the Granite State already had the highest in-state tuition in the country for four-year schools, according to the College Board. The television ad also doesn’t specify that it is referring to four-year colleges. Under Hassan, two-year community colleges have frozen tuition for several years running. Community colleges in New Hampshire are also not the most expensive in the country. During the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, that distinction belonged to Vermont, according to the College Board. All of these things are correct: Hassan did make a one-time $3 million rescission from the university system for the 2014-15 year, New Hampshire did have the highest tuition rate in the country for public four-year schools in 2015-2016, and tuition did rise under Hassan’s tenure. But these things do not add up to Hassan raising tuition. While the governor played an important role in setting the budget that heavily influenced tuition rates, she was one among many players, and the University System is the one that sets tuition rates, not the governor. Our ruling The National Senatorial Committee says Maggie Hassan ""raised tuition, making it the highest in America."" For starters, in-state tuition in New Hampshire for four-year colleges has been the highest in America for years, but it was that way before Hassan took office. As for Hassan’s role as governor, of the two budgets she crafted, one gave the university system enough money to freeze tuition, according to USNH leaders, and the other one didn’t. Additionally, the state budget does not dictate tuition rates, the board of trustees does. In addition, the Republican-controlled Legislature pared down what Hassan offered in her budget proposal. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts.

Tim Kaine overstates Clinton's record on cutting Russia's nuclear stockpile
","Whereas Donald Trump has undisclosed business dealings with Russia, Hillary Clinton got the country to reduce its nuclear weapons, said Clinton’s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. At the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate in Farmville, Va., Kaine argued Clinton is more equipped than Trump to deal with Russia. ""She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile,"" he said. New START, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, is an agreement between Russia and the United States designed to limit both countries’ deployed strategic nuclear weapons. The original START treaty was in force from 1994 until it expired in 2009; New START was signed in April 2010 and went into effect in February 2011. Clinton has similarly touted the New START agreement, saying it cuts Russia’s nuclear arms. We rated her claim Half True because it overstated the treaty’s impact. Kaine’s claim that the treaty was supposed ""to reduce Russia’s nuclear stockpile"" falls into the same hole, just a bit deeper. The treaty, in fact, doesn’t require Russia to cut its nuclear stockpile at all because it only limits deployed weapons. ""Russia is not expected to rapidly or dramatically reduce its nuclear weapons holdings,"" said Lisa Koch, a professor and nuclear proliferation expert at Claremont McKenna College. ""New START could be characterized as a modest, rather than a sweeping, arms control treaty."" What’s in the treaty? As secretary of state, Clinton was involved in New START's negotiation and passage. Replacing the prior START treaty was a priority of Clinton's in the beginning of her tenure in 2009. She served as co-commissioner of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission with Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, and she personally met with Russian leaders in Moscow to discuss New START during the negotiation phase. She also was involved in persuading senators to support the treaty.  New START has three primary limitations on vehicles capable of launching nuclear weapons and the nuclear warheads themselves. By February 2018, Russia and the United States each have to meet these restrictions: 700 deployed ballistic missiles and heavy bombers, which include intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons; 800 total deployed and non-deployed launchers, such as intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers, and nuclear-capable heavy bombers; 1,550 total deployed nuclear warheads on these missiles and bombers. It’s accurate that these limits are more restrictive than prior treaties. For example, START I limited deployed nuclear warheads to 6,000, and the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty limited them to 1,700-2,200. But it’s questionable whether it has, in practice, reduced Russia’s nuclear arsenal for two main reasons: First, Russia was actually below New START limits in two out of the three categories right when treaty implementation began in February 2011. The State Department publishes where both countries stand on these requirements twice a year, starting with an initial exchange of data when New START took force in February 2011. At that time, Russia had 865 deployed and non-deployed launchers for strategic missiles and heavy bombers, meaning it would have to reduce that fleet by 65 to meet the limit of 800 by February 2018. However, Russia had 521 deployed missiles and heavy bombers out of 700 allowed, and 1,537 deployed nuclear warheads out of 1,550 allowed. So Russia could actually increase its deployed missiles and heavy bombers, as well as its deployed nuclear warheads, beyond that initial February 2011 count and still be within treaty limits. Before New START passed, it was clear Russia intended to modernize its nuclear arsenal in a big way, said Steven Pifer, director of the Brookings Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative. Now, their modernization efforts have to fit within the New START limits, and it’s unclear if they would have grown beyond those limits absent the treaty. ""I would say that New START does reduce and limit Russian strategic arms, but I would not overly hype the depth of the reduction,"" said Pifer, a Clinton supporter who testified before Congress in favor of New START. Second, New START only limits a portion of the nuclear arsenals. New START mainly counts strategic, deployed weapons. But it doesn’t limit nonstrategic weapons, nor weapons that have been stockpiled or retired. The treaty ""does not require either government to destroy non-deployed warheads,"" Koch said. ""Both governments can still stockpile warheads beyond the agreed-upon limit of 1,550 without violating the treaty."" Excluding the thousands of warheads that have been retired and are awaiting dismantlement, Russia currently has about 4,500 nuclear warheads, including stockpiles and 1,735 deployed warheads, according to Federation for American Scientists estimates. Russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline since the 1990s. That decline has nearly stagnated during President Barack Obama’s presidency, hovering at around 4,500 since 2012, according to Federation for American Scientists data. Throughout Obama’s tenure — and Clinton’s term as secretary of state — Russia has shrunk its total nuclear arsenal far less than it did under the past three presidents. And it would be difficult to attribute any reduction in Russia’s nuclear stockpiles to New START, given that the treaty only limits deployed weapons. ""The end of the Cold War, the financial crisis in the 1990s and the START I treaty had a much greater effect on shaping Russia's current and planned nuclear posture than the New START treaty,"" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, which supports arms control. It’s worth noting that some experts no longer consider stockpiles a serious threat to security. Under New START’s deployed weapons restrictions, the effectiveness of a large stockpile is limited, especially because Russia only produces about 10 missiles per year, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Thus the treaty might make it so that Russia does not feel the need to stockpile as many weapons. Our ruling Kaine said Clinton ""went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile."" New START cuts the number of strategic weapons that the United States and Russia can have deployed at any time, and Clinton played a key role in treaty negotiations. However, it does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons. The treaty hasn’t cut Russia’s nuclear arms yet. But if it does in the future, after the treaty is fully implemented in 2018, it seems that any reductions would be minimal rather than sweeping. And Russia, for the most part, was actually meeting the treaty’s limits when implementation began.

"['Missouri', 'Guns', 'Jason  Kander']","
Kander supported Second Amendment while in office
","In a September campaign TV spot that has gained national attention, Jason Kander assembles a military assault rifle while blindfolded. Kander, who is Missouri’s secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, puts together an AR-15 in 30 seconds. As he assembles the gun, he talks about how his opponent, Republican Roy Blunt, has attacked his record on guns Kander, a former Army captain, says ""In the Army, I learned how to use and respect my rifle."" He continues to say, ""In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights,"" while supporting background checks to keep guns like the AR-15 ""out of the hands of terrorists."" Kander was a Missouri state representative for four years, from 2009 to 2012, before he was elected secretary of state. We wanted to know more about how Kander handled Second Amendment issues as a representative, so we decided to investigate his claim. Voting record We asked Kander’s campaign about his statement, and his staff sent us part of his voting record. In 2011, Kander voted in favor of a bill that would lower the age — from 23 to 21— at which a person could get a permit to conceal and carry a gun. Kander voted against the bill when the House first debated it, but switched for the final vote. The bill became law. In 2012, he voted to lower the conceal-and-carry age from 21 to 18 for military members. That bill also became law. That same year, Kander voted for a resolution that would amend the Missouri Constitution to protect ""the right of every citizen to possess, purchase, reload, or manufacture ammunition and any other parts or articles essential to the proper functioning of arms."" The resolution died in a Senate committee. But that’s only part of the story when it comes to Kander and gun legislation. The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund gave Kander an ‘F’ rating on his advocacy for the Second Amendment for 2016. It provided us with more information about Kander’s voting record. In 2009, Kander voted against a bill that would extend the Castle Doctrine to renters. The doctrine allows a homeowner to use deadly force against a perceived intruder. The bill also would have lowered the age to get a concealed carry permit and would remove a ban on carrying a gun on a college campus. Kander voted against the ""Business Premises Safety Act"" four times – once during each of his terms as a state representative. That bill would have prevented business owners from restricting people from lawfully possessing a firearm in a car on business property. Both the NRA and incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, Kander’s opponent, have released ads in response to Kander’s ad, denouncing his claim that he supports the Second Amendment. What the Supreme Court says about the Second Amendment So Kander did not support every effort to expand access to guns while serving in the state legislature. That doesn’t mean he is against Second Amendment rights. In a 2010 landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment prohibition against infringement on the right to ""keep and bear arms"" extends to state and local governments. But the court has also ruled in the 2008 case of District of Columbia v. Heller that some restrictions on guns are acceptable. In the Heller decision, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, made clear that while D.C. could not ban handguns, the Second Amendment is ""not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" He went on to say that some restrictions, like the prohibition of guns in churches and government buildings, were not affected by the court’s decision. Carrying a concealed weapon is also subject to regulation. Kander’s votes against expanding access to guns fall within the Supreme Court’s definition of allowable regulation of the Second Amendment. He has never proposed, or voted for, a bill that would repeal the Second Amendment or flout the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the amendment, our review found. Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law and well-known constitutional law expert, said in an email that analysis of Kander’s stance on the Second Amendment depends on two questions: ""Does one believe that the Second Amendment protects a right to have guns?"" and ""Are particular regulations of guns desirable?"" ""Even if one believes in the Second Amendment right to have guns, that does not mean that every law to allow more access to guns should be regarded as a good thing,"" he said. ""Someone could believe in the Second Amendment, but still support some restrictions on guns."" Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in constitutional law, agreed. ""The Supreme Court has only said that the right protects the right to have a handgun in the home,"" he said in an email. ""So long as he did not vote to deny law-abiding people that right, then he can reasonably claim to be a supporter of the right to bear arms."" Our ruling In a TV ad, Kander said, ""In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights."" As a state representative, Kander voted in favor of two bills, which are now law, that would lower the age for someone to conceal and carry a weapon. On the other hand, he also voted against several bills that would reduce regulations on guns. In short, his gun record is nuanced. Further, experts cautioned us not to draw a straight line between votes and gun legislation and support for the Second Amendment. It is possible to support the Second Amendment and favor some regulation on guns. Even though he sometimes voted against bills to expand access to guns, it is fair for Kander to say he supported the Second Amendment as a legislator. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate Kander’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/05a77216-92bf-4df3-933b-6d093512c2a7",/factchecks/2016/oct/06/jason-kander/kander-supported-second-amendment-while-office/

Colin Van Ostern says rejection of Planned Parenthood contract meant fewer women got health care
","Over the past few years, the issue of Planned Parenthood funding has turned New Hampshire’s little-known Executive Council into a lightning rod for controversy. Now that two executive councilors - Republican Chris Sununu and Democrat Colin Van Ostern - are running for governor, their votes on Planned Parenthood have become a significant issue on the campaign trail. Van Ostern has repeatedly claimed Sununu’s 2015 vote against $639,000 of state funding to Planned Parenthood of Northern New England denied health care to thousands of women and families in the state, saying nearly 3,000 fewer women and families accessed services statewide because of the defeated contract. Van Ostern has repeatedly said the lost funding has affected ""thousands"" of women and families. ""Real damage can come from one vote on the executive council,"" he said during an August speech. As a result of Sununu’s vote, ""nearly 1,000 fewer women and families accessed health care here for birth control and cancer screenings and annual exams in this city of Manchester and nearly 3,000 fewer did statewide,"" he said. Van Osten went back to the point again at a Concord Monitor/NECN debate on Oct. 5, saying as a result of Sununu’s vote, ""fewer women got birth control, cancer screening and annual exams.""   PolitiFact decided to take a look at the numbers. There’s little question Sununu was the swing vote on Planned Parenthood funding. He had voted for similar contracts in the past, and when the funding came up in August 2015, he cited concerns about videos that purportedly showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue. In June, 2016, he changed course, and the funding was ultimately restored by a 3-2 vote. To get a scope of the numbers of women that were affected, we reached out to Van Ostern’s camp, which cited a 2015 WMUR article that quoted Planned Parenthood of Northern New England Senior Policy Advisor Jennifer Frizzell. ""According to details provided by Frizzell, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England served 14,191 patients at the end of 2014, but that number dropped by 21 percent, to 11,119, by the end of 2015 as a result of the ‘lost funding,’"" the article said. But numbers from Planned Parenthood show something different. The five Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire saw 11,078 patients in 2014; the following year, they saw about 1,000 fewer patients statewide, according to numbers provided by the organization. It turns out that the 21 percent drop the WMUR article references included patients that were lost when a West Lebanon Planned Parenthood clinic relocated to neighboring White River Junction, Vt. in 2014. Before the relocation, Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire saw about 14,000 patients. That number dropped to about 11,000 after the West Lebanon clinic moved. The drop of 1,000 patients between 2014 and 2015 also takes into account a 5-week closure of the Claremont Planned Parenthood clinic after it was vandalized and heavily damaged. That clinic served 948 patients in 2014, which fell 20 percent to 755 the following year, the steepest drop out of all the clinics. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England spokeswoman Victoria Bonney said the lost funding from Sununu’s 2015 Executive Council vote affected access to services including family planning, birth control, well-woman visits, cancer screenings and STI testing and treatment, but patients were never turned away. Bonney said the lost funding did not result in staff layoffs or denying patients care. Rather, it impacted scheduling and meant fewer patients were seen each day. Some health centers normally staffed with three practitioners a day had to scale back to two, according to Bonney. ""During the defund, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England never turned patients away and tried to meet demand with fewer resources,"" Bonney said. ""But when patients hear Planned Parenthood has been defunded, they put off health care. With so much media attention on Chris Sununu’s 2015 vote to defund Planned Parenthood, patients may have been uncertain if they could still access necessary services."" Our ruling Democratic candidate for governor Colin Van Ostern said as a result of Chris Sununu’s vote against a Planned Parenthood contract, ""nearly 3,000 fewer"" women and families statewide accessed health care for birth control, cancer screenings and annual exams Sununu, a Republican, did vote against a $639,000 Planned Parenthood contract in 2015. It led to fewer shifts at clinics, but no patients were ever turned away or denied care, the organization said. The numbers cited by Van Ostern weren’t accurate. About 1,000 fewer women accessed Planned Parenthood from one year to the next. His numbers, however, failed to account for one clinic moving out of state, and another one being closed for 5 weeks following an incident of vandalism. Still, some patients may have stayed away following the publicity surrounding the vote.  We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/06/colin-van-ostern/colin-van-ostern-says-rejection-planned-parenthood/

""According to the Colorado state government, marijuana use among high school students has not increased since legalization,"" the ad, which started airing Sept. 27, claims. We should also note that the anti-pot camp has used Colorado teen pot statistics in their ads. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012. The first retail store opened in January 2014. We have seen multiple numbers on teen pot use, so we wondered if this claim held up. Barrett Marson, a spokesman with the pro-marijuana campaign, pointed us to the 2015 Healthy Kids Colorado Survey. The ad cites a June 2016 Denver Post article, which references the survey. This survey, which takes place every two years, is done by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. The 2015 version surveys about 17,000 middle and high school students at random. According to the results, 38 percent of high school students surveyed said they used marijuana at least once their life. In 2013, that number was 36.9 percent. The 2015 survey also noted that 21.2 percent of high-schoolers used marijuana in the last 30 days. That number was 19.7 percent in 2013. However, the stats are not significant, according to multiple experts we spoke with. This means the data has wiggle room. ""There was not a statistically significant increase in 30-day or lifetime marijuana use among high school students between 2013 and 2015,"" said Mark Salley, a spokesman with Colorado’s health department. The state’s top health official, Dr. Larry Wolk, said the same thing in December 2015 when looking at federal data -- from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health -- on the topic. The national survey notes that 11.16 percent of Colorado 12- to 17-year-olds in the 2012-13 cycle used marijuana in the last 30 days . That number was 12.56 percent in the 2013-14 cycle. ""This is not a statistically significant increase at the 5 percent level of significance,"" said Brad Stone, a spokesman with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Jonathan Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said the clock hasn’t even really started on the full effects of legalizing recreational marijuana. ""We’re not going to see the full effects of legalization until something like 25 years after national legalization,"" Caulkins said. ""It takes time for the industry to adapt to new opportunities, go through the usual shake-out period."" Our rating The ad claimed, ""according to the Colorado state government, marijuana use among high school students has not increased since legalization."" Based on the numbers cited, there does appear to have been a slight increase in marijuana use among Colorado’s high school students. However, multiple experts we spoke with said that increase is not statistically significant. They also said it was too early to draw conclusions about marijuana use, and that more years of study will be needed. We rate the ad’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1b3ae305-61f4-4506-a9c8-c0a27f4d2c2e",/factchecks/2016/oct/06/campaign-regulate-marijuana-alcohol/has-colorado-teen-pot-use-not-increased-legalizati/

Attack ad’s unsubstantiated claim on Pat Toomey, Trump and abortion
","One pro-choice political action committee said in a recent ad that if Pennsylvanians re-elect Sen. Pat Toomey to the Senate, he’ll work together with GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump to ban abortion and punish women who have them. The attack ad, put out last week by NARAL Pro-Choice America, is part of a surge of outside spending in the Pennsylvania Senate race. Democrats have for months tied Toomey, a Republican who hasn’t explicitly endorsed the presidential nominee, to Trump -- but this ad takes it a step farther. It first flashes a clip of an interview between Trump and MSNBC’s Chris Matthews from March when Trump caused an uproar by saying women should be punished for having an abortion. ""Pat Toomey might use different words, but his agenda is the same,"" the narrator of the ad says. ""Toomey and Trump will ban abortion and punish women who have them."" No, they probably won’t. First and foremost, the president and the Senate can’t ban abortion and punish women who have them. First, the U.S. Supreme Court would need to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 43-year-old decision that says states can’t put in place unreasonable barriers for women seeking abortions. Whether Congress can even vote to restrict abortion is in dispute, and was a major issue last year when lawmakers considered a bill that would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks in most cases. Toomey and Trump do mostly agree on abortion: Both consider themselves to be pro-life, and both have said they would support the overturning of Roe v. Wade if the Supreme Court did so. Toomey’s said that abortion should be up to states to decide and, if Pennsylvania banned abortion, he would support it. In a 2009 interview also with Matthews, when asked if doctors who perform abortions should face prison time, Toomey said: ""At some point doctors performing abortions I think would be subject to that sort of penalty.""  Trump took it farther in March during that now-infamous interview on MSNBC. During a segment on abortion, Trump said: ""There has to be some form of punishment."" Matthews responded: ""For the woman?"" Trump replied: ""Yeah."" But the GOP nominee walked back those comments hours later in what PolitiFact has previously dubbed ""as clear a reversal as it comes."" ""If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,"" Trump said in a statement at the time. ""The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions."" But we weren’t able to find a single example of Toomey saying he believes women should be punished for having an abortion. A campaign spokesman said ""he obviously does not."" When we reached out to NARAL for any evidence that Toomey supports punishing women who have abortions, a spokesperson directed us to NARAL’s own website. At the top of a page dedicated to Toomey, it reads: ""Together, Pat Toomey and Donald Trump will ban abortion and punish women who have them."" The sources listed include Trump’s interview with Matthews, as well as three citations related to Toomey’s stances on abortion. The first is a quote from Toomey during a 2010 Senate campaign debate, in which he says ""I think Roe v. Wade was mistakenly determined and I support its repeal."" During that same debate, Toomey said: ""I’m pro-life. And I would accept a ban on abortions, with the exceptions of rape and incest and the life of the mother."" The second citation from NARAL notes that Toomey co-sponsored the bill last year that banned abortion after 20 weeks and would stipulate doctors who perform them could face prison time. That bill, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, never made it out of committee. The third citation notes that last year, Toomey voted in favor of a bill that would have made it harder for victims of human trafficking to seek federal assistance in paying for an abortion. Democrats and Republicans eventually came to a compromise on that bill that meant federal funds wouldn’t be used for abortions, but Democrats didn’t see the amendments as an affront to women’s health. None of the citations showed Toomey saying or implying he believes women who have abortions should be legally punished. Our Ruling In an attack ad, NARAL Pro-Choice America said, ""Toomey and Trump will ban abortion and punish women who have them."" Even if Toomey and Trump could themselves ban abortion and punish women who have them, Toomey has never said he’d support punishing women who have abortions. Trump said he’d support such a measure, but walked back that stance hours after saying it. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525a11ea-916b-474f-b872-a15c52b04277",/factchecks/2016/oct/06/naral-pro-choice/attack-ads-unsubstantiated-claim-pat-toomey-trump-/

How much money have Wall Street and hedge funds given to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign?
","Attacking Hillary Clinton at a rally in Waukesha, Wis., one theme Donald Trump sounded repeatedly was: ""Follow the money."" And one of the attacks during Sept. 28, 2016 remarks was this: ""In her campaign for president, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds."" That’s a colossal figure. Is it accurate? Hedging bets Clinton’s support from the financial sector has made news throughout the campaign. A week before the Trump rally, it was reported that George Soros and two other hedge fund managers had given a total of $5.5 million to Clinton’s campaign or to super PACs supporting her in August 2016. But that’s a long way from $100 million. If you think you’ve heard that figure before, perhaps it was from a February 2016 report by the Wall Street Journal. It estimated that since Clinton and former President Bill Clinton entered national politics in the early 1990s, Wall Street has contributed more than $100 million to their political campaigns, charitable foundation and personal finances. So, that doesn’t help Trump’s claim. The campaign figures The go-to source on this is OpenSecrets.org, the website of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The center generally considers ""Wall Street"" and hedge funds to be the securities and investment industry. However, other industries could be added, as well. Trump’s campaign didn’t get back to us with evidence to back his claim. But we tried to view his claim broadly. We counted contributions to Clinton’s campaign as well as to super PACs that support her. And we counted contributions not only from the securities and investment industry, but also two related industries, as they are categorized by the Center for Responsive Politics. To be clear: The contributions don’t come from firms. Rather they come from individual employees or members of the organizations, or political action committees tied to the organizations. Here’s what we found (figures are rounded): Industry Contributions to Clinton campaign Contributions to pro-Clinton super PACs Total Securities and investment $7.23 million $51.4 million $58.6 million Miscellaneous finance $2.55 million $1.18 million $3.74 million Commercial banks $1.9 million $55,000 $1.96 million Grand totals $11.7 million $52.6 million $64.3 million It’s also worth noting, as the Center for Responsive Politics has reported, that most of the ""Wall Street"" contributions benefiting Clinton ""have come from a tiny group of ultra-wealthy, liberal donors who work in finance. Wall Street more broadly doesn’t have any outsized affection for Clinton, but a relative handful of donors who work in the industry have invested heavily in her."" Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for Trump and super PACs backing him total far less than $2 million. (Trump has often said he is ""self-funding"" his campaign, a claim that’s been rated Half True. His campaign accepts contributions, but there’s no question he has funded much of the effort, which might explain in part why Clinton gets so much more money from Wall Street.) Our rating Campaigning outside Milwaukee, Trump said: ""In her campaign for president,"" Clinton ""has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds."" The gold-standard source on this subject puts the figure at $64 million. We rate Trump’s statement False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/06/donald-trump/how-much-money-have-wall-street-and-hedge-funds-gi/

Pence's False claim that Trump 'hasn't broken' tax return promise
","Donald Trump’s tax returns became a fiery point of contention between vice presidential nominees Tim Kaine and Mike Pence in their first and only debate. ""Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014, and he said, ‘If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes,’ "" Kaine charged. ""He's broken his first — "" ""And he will,"" Pence interjected. ""He's broken his first promise,"" Kaine insisted. ""He hasn't broken his promise,"" Pence said. ""Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires. The American people can review that. And he's going -- senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over."" ""Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit,"" Kaine countered accurately, before the moderator directed the discussion to Social Security. Kaine was referencing a 2014 interview Trump did with Irish TV. While he didn't use those exact words, Kaine's quote is largely accurate. That was before Trump was actually running for president.  But Trump has said he would release his tax returns multiple times since annoucning his candidacy as well.  ""Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?"" NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Trump in January 2016. ""Well, we're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely,"" Trump replied. A few weeks later, Trump told the Today Show in February 2016 that he’ll release his tax returns ""probably over the next few months."" Since those comments, Trump has repeated the promise but with conditions. Recently, he’s said he would release them once Clinton releases all of her emails. And as Pence mentioned, Trump has said repeatedly he has yet to do so because an ongoing IRS audit. (He’s also suggested he probably won't before election day.) According to his tax attorneys, Trump has been ""under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002."" But he’s also promised to release his tax returns without this condition and, presumably, while under audit in 2011, 2014 and 2015. As Buzzfeed reported, Trump suggested he’d ""love"" to release his tax returns in 2011, when he was flirting with a presidential bid and questioning Barack Obama’s birthplace. ""Maybe I’m going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate,"" Trump said in an April 18, 2011, interview with ABC. ""I may tie my tax returns, I’d love to give my tax returns, I may tie my tax returns into Obama’s birth certificate."" When the White House released Obama’s birth certificate a week later, Trump told ABC he would fulfill his pledge and release his tax records ""at the appropriate time."" A few years later, Trump had yet to release his tax returns, prompting an Irish television host to ask him about it in a May 2014 interview. ""You questioned his citizenship during his campaign, and you said afterwards if he produced that long-form birth certificate, you’d produce your tax returns. But you didn’t do it, did you?"" asked TV3’s Colette Fitzpatrick. ""Well I don’t know, did he do it?"" Trump said. ""If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that.""   Trump also repeatedly agreed to release his tax returns in a February 2015 interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. If he ran for president, Trump said, ""I would release tax returns and I’d also explain to people that as a person that’s looking to make money — you know, I’m in the business of making money until I do this — and if I won, I would make money for our country."" ""How many years back?"" Hewitt asked. ""Three years, five years?"" ""The answer is I would do it. But I will tell you upfront, as a private person, and I’m very proud of this, I want to pay as little taxes as I can as a private person,"" Trump said. ""Of course. That’s the American way. Legally,"" Hewitt agreed. ""But how many years back would you go back? Three, five? ""I don’t know. I actually have not even thought of that. But I would certainly show tax returns if necessary. Well, what have they been doing? They’ve been really doing one year other than people that never made anything. But I would certainly — I’m very proud of what I’ve done. I do pay tax, but I’m very proud of what I’ve done,"" Trump said. ""I have no objection to showing any tax return."" Nineteen months later, and five weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Trump still has not released any returns. Our ruling Pence said Trump ""hasn't broken his promise"" to release his tax returns. Trump said he would ""absolutely"" release his tax returns in January 2016 and that it'll happen ""probably over the next few months"" in February without the stipulation of an IRS audit. He also made the promise in 2011, 2014 and 2015 without conditions.   There’s still 33 days left before Election Day, so Trump still has time to honor this pledge. But, as of Oct. 4, 2016, when Pence made his claim, Trump has yet to show the public the money.

Dana Young mailer leaves out context of fracking bill
","In an attempt to position herself as a more environmentally-friendly candidate, state Rep. Dana Young, R-Tampa, has sent mailers touting her vote for a recent bill targeting fracking. The effects of the legislation Young voted for are not as clear cut as the claim Young makes. A third-party group supporting Young, who is facing Democrat Bob Buesing for state Senate in the newly created District 18, sent the mailer in the last weeks of September that says she ""voted for a statewide fracking ban to protect our water."" The group, the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, paid for the mailpiece, but the mailer says that Young approved the message. So we are putting Young on the Truth-O-Meter.  The mailer refers to Young’s vote on House Bill 191, legislation aimed at regulating fracking in Florida. We were curious about the Young’s statement and the specifics of the measure. As we looked further into the bill, we found the mailer is somewhat misleading. What Young voted for would have regulated fracking, but it wouldn’t have permanently banned it. A closer look at House Bill 191 HB 191, dubbed ""Regulation of Oil and Gas Resources,"" was sponsored by Rep. Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, and passed 73 to 45 on Jan. 27 in the Florida House. Young voted in favor of this bill, along with 72 other Republicans, while 38 Democrats and 7 Republicans opposed the bill. Young reasoned that HB 191 could have been the first step to a permanent ban on fracking. However, the bill only called for a temporary moratorium on the process, not a ""ban"" like her mailer says. Democrats who voted against the bill echoed arguments of environmental groups and said a temporary ban doesn’t go far enough to protect Florida’s water. Had the bill passed (it was defeated in a Florida Senate committee), the measure would have allowed Florida to regulate fracking — a process that involves pumping large amounts of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to harness oil and gas reserves. Per the bill, fracking permits would not have been issued until a study was completed in 2017 by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The DEP would have proposed rules based on the study’s results, which would have been subject to approval of the Legislature. Point being, the bill was never intended to ban fracking permanently, but place a moratorium on the practice while its effects were studied. Democrats also took issue with the fact the bill would have prohibited Florida's counties and cities from passing local bans against fracking. According to the Miami Herald, 41 cities and 27 counties oppose fracking. St. Petersburg has passed a resolution against hydraulic fracturing, along with Broward County, which outlawed fracking in January. In addition, there were several amendments to HB191 offered up by Democrats that would have created more safeguards against fracking, including a restriction on what chemicals can be used and studies on prenatal health, but they didn’t pass. Young voted against some of these, but her spokesperson said those issues were unnecessary, trusting the DEP study would have addressed those concerns. Young’s office said she strongly opposes fracking in Florida and will continue to seek a statewide ban. Our ruling A mailer from Young says she ""voted for a statewide ban on fracking."" That vote is in reference to HB 191, which would have set up a temporary moratorium on fracking in anticipation of future regulations. The bill would have authorized a study on which to base further regulation. It was not an outright ban on fracking. Young’s claim is partially accurate but is missing context that would give the reader a different impression. For that reason, we rate Young’s statement Half True. Correction: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly reported who sent the mailer. The piece has been updated to reflect that it was sent by an outside committee with Young's approval. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ed07ec3c-17f2-456c-aded-b343caaff2b7",/factchecks/2016/oct/05/dana-young/dana-young-mailer-leaves-out-context-fracking-bill/

Mike Pence tidies up Donald Trump's quote about Mexicans as 'good people'
","During the vice presidential debate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence found himself having to defend past statements made by his ticket-mate, Donald Trump, again and again. At one point, Tim Kaine, a Virginia senator, lit into Pence by saying, ""When Donald Trump says women should be punished, or Mexicans are rapists and criminals…"" After some crosstalk, Pence responded, ""Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again."" Kaine continued to press his case, saying, ""Can you defend it?"" Pence: ""There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives."" Kaine: ""You want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?"" Pence: ""He also said, ‘And many of them are good people.’ You keep leaving that out of your quote."" Unfortunately for Pence, his memory was a little faulty. The exchange centered on comments Trump made last year in the speech at Trump Tower in New York City when he kicked off his presidential campaign. Here’s the relevant portion of what Trump said: ""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Pence has a point that there was more to Trump’s comment than just that ""Mexicans are rapists and criminals,"" as Kaine said during the debate. In fact, we have previously taken Kaine to task for oversimplifying Trump’s Trump Tower comment. In August, we gave Kaine a False for saying that Trump had said that ""all Mexicans are rapists."" But Pence went too far in downplaying the severity of Trump’s original comment. According to Pence, Trump said that ""many"" Mexicans are ""good people."" In reality, Trump said ""some"" rather than ""many,"" which doesn’t sound as magnanimous. And Trump further undercut that sentiment by adding a grudging, ""I assume."" Our ruling Pence said that Trump, in his campaign announcement speech, ""also said and many of them (Mexicans) are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote."" Pence is right that Kaine left that part of the comment out of the quote. But the part Kaine left out is not quite as benign as Pence indicates. Trump said ""some,"" rather than ""many,"" and he prefaced that by saying, ""I assume.""

Tim Kaine recalls Mike Pence comment on Vladimir Putin
","One of the themes of the vice presidential debate in Farmville, Va., involved Tim Kaine pressing Mike Pence on controversial statements made by either Pence or Donald Trump. Kaine, a Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia, tried particularly hard to pin his rival down on favorable statements about Russian leader Vladimir Putin. At one point, Kaine said, ""Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. … Gov. Pence made the odd claim — he said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class."" Kaine hammered the point again later in the debate. ""Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Gov. Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama."" Pence, the governor of Indiana, pounced, saying, ""That is absolutely inaccurate. … He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage."" So who was right? A close look at the original comment suggests that both have a point, but neither is fully accurate. Understanding this claim requires going back to exchanges that occurred about a month earlier. On several occasions during the campaign, Trump had spoken admiringly of Putin. For instance, in NBC’s Commander in Chief Forum on Sept. 7, Trump said, ""The man has very strong control over a country. It's a very different system and I don't happen to like the system, but certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader."" The following day, Pence was asked about Trump’s remark in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Pence supported what his ticket-mate had said. ""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,"" Pence said. ""And that's going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president."" So Kaine has a point that Pence did say something seemingly favorable to Putin’s leadership, saying he’d been ""a stronger leader"" than Obama. But Kaine related the remark inaccurately, saying Pence had said Putin was ""a better leader than President Obama."" Pence never used the term ""better."" As it turns out, Trump himself had used the word ""better,"" at least twice. During a July 27 news conference in Florida, Trump said, ""Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?"" And on the July 28 edition of Fox & Friends, Trump did say Putin is ""a better leader than Obama."" But during the debate, Kaine didn’t say Trump said these things. He said Pence did.  Meanwhile, Pence’s response to Kaine’s jab wasn’t airtight, either. First, Pence’s counterpunch seemed to conflate his own comments on Putin with Trump’s. And second, Trump was never explicit that he was referring to Putin's role on the ""world stage.""  Our ruling In the debate, Kaine said that Pence had ""said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama."" Pence did say something very similar -- but not exactly as Kaine said. Pence had said that Putin ""has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country.""
