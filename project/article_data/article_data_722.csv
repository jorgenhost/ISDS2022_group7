Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele says county buses are no less safe now than a year or two ago
","
A spate of diametrically opposed claims about safety on Milwaukee County buses is the latest product of the increasingly bitter battle between Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. and County Executive Chris Abele.

The sheriff, whose agency helps police buses, released videos of student fights to dramatize that, as he put it, ""a ride on a Milwaukee county bus has become a frightening experience.""

The bad news aboard or around buses in December 2011 included a fight culminating in an attack against a mother who was with a 2-year-old child, an assault against a driver, a road-rage episode and stunning footage of beatings of students.

Taking a somewhat longer view, Abele told reporters there is no disturbing new trend.

""I think he’s misrepresenting the facts,"" Abele told CBS 58 TV reporter. ""If the sheriff has given you the impression that transit is less safe than it was a year ago or the year before that, then he’s giving the wrong impression.""

We’ll focus on that two-year time period, but also peek at how Clarke can say incidents on buses have spiked five years in a row since 2006, while Abele cites a big drop comparing 2011 to 2006.

This dispute escalated to the point that Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn stepped in to have his officers patrol buses, which prompted Clarke and Flynn to hammer at each other.

Both Clarke and Abele referred to data on ""incidents"" when we asked. But Clarke couldn’t show us numbers to back up his assertion of a five-year rise. Abele did produce transit system figures, but his claim of a drop comparing 2011 to 2006 is misleading because he compared the present to a high point.

In any event, the ""incidents"" figures are highly diluted. They include many hundreds of problems so minor -- sleeping on the bus, for example -- that neither law enforcement nor the transit system’s private security force was called in to deal with them.

So let’s stick to more serious incidents -- and Abele’s statement about the last two years. We’ll look at violence, lawbreaking and other security problems that required intervention by law enforcement or G4S, the private security company formerly known as Wackenhut.

Here’s our analysis of figures provided by the Milwaukee County Transit System (2011 figures are through Dec. 20).

Law enforcement responses: This is arguably the most important measurement, and the trend line goes up -- though in roller-coaster fashion around 600 responses per year.

Police were called in 12 percent more often in 2010 than in 2009, but those cases were on pace to fall about 5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. So, buses were less safe this year than in 2009, but more safe this year than in 2010.

But if you look at the last two years mentioned by Abele, and compare the responses from the previous two years, they are up slightly, about 4 percent.

All responses: Counting all instances when police and/or private security was needed, incidents went up the last two years. This year, compared to 2009, they are up more than 13 percent.

Those are the broad numbers for police and private security responses. But there are hundreds of non-criminal episodes such as fare disputes included, though, so let’s take a closer look at the violent incidents.

Assaults and verbal altercations against passengers: Security was called -- and law enforcement sometimes dispatched --  in 150 such cases in 2011, up from 139 in 2010 and 106 in 2009. That’s two years in a row of increases, though it moderated in 2011, according to a report MCTS ran for us.

Assaults against drivers: This counts drivers struck by a person, but mainly by objects or fluids (such as spittle). There were 29 such incidents in 2009, 24 in 2010 and 25 this year. It’s fallen off more compared to 35 in 2008. There were six drivers struck by individuals in 2011, though not all of these cases were serious enough to warrant medical attention.

Non-violent lawbreaking: We only have two years of data here. It was virtually unchanged at nearly 900 incidents per year, this category includes threats, weapons incidents, off-bus fights and disorderly conduct, vandalism and profane/drunken behavior. The number represents how many time private security -- and police in some cases -- were called in.

Those are the numbers.

A transit spokeswoman sees no red flags in the fluctuations and mixed trends.

""There’s not an increase in crime, there’s an increase in attention,"" said Jacqueline Janz of MCTS.

The numbers are a bit of a mixed bag, but show lawbreaking and violence is a consistent, if relatively uncommon, phenomenon on county buses that -- MCTS officials are quick to point out -- provide 44 million passenger trips a year on 411 buses, most without incident.

Broadly speaking, it’s happening less now than five years ago, but more than it was two years ago, based on total responses by police and security. The Abele statement we are checking referred to the last two years.

Assaults on drivers are notably down over two to three years.

But looking at the broadest measure of serious problems (altercations among passengers), the history shows a significant increase two years in a row. That’s the time frame Abele referred to, and we think Clarke’s critique focuses mainly on these kind of serious incidents.

To be sure, there’s no dramatic swing up, as Clarke’s rhetoric implied. And the picture improves when the longer view is taken, though as we noted that’s selectively taking a high point as the starting point.

But Abele’s claim about buses being no less safe than a year or two ago flies in the face of the passenger altercation stats. Plus, Abele makes use of overly broad ""incident"" numbers that are highly misleading as a measure of crime.

There’s enough counter evidence -- the declining number of bus drivers struck -- to give Abele’s claim an element of truth. But it also gives a wrong impression.

Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher says Marcy Kaptur opposed a ban on gender abortions
","
Almost 40 years after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion under most circumstances, abortion remains a political hot button. 
Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher, the Republican congressional candidate in Ohio's 9th District, demonstrates that in a news release, video and series of Twitter tweets aimed at Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur.

""I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur has the same belief system as someone in the Chinese politburo or that she thinks it's OK to kill unborn babies. And I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur believes in gendercide,"" he says in the campaign video.

""But Marcy Kaptur voted against a ban which would have prevented the aborting of a baby girl for the sole reason that she's a girl.""

That's an emotional pitch.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

Wurzlbacher’s campaign said the vote was on H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2012, or ""PRENDA.""

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, would have made it a federal crime with a five-year prison sentence to perform or force a woman to undergo a gender-selection abortion -- a practice that is most common in some Asian countries where families that want sons abort female fetuses.

Under the bill, doctors, nurses and medical personnel who do not report suspected gender-related abortions would also face prison and a fine. The male partner and parents of the woman having the abortion would be able to sue for damages. The woman would be exempt from prosecution or civil suit.

Republicans said in debate that gender-selection abortion amounts to ""gendercide"" and a ""war on women"" because it is female fetuses that are most often targeted -- rhetoric that effectively turned the tables on Democrats who previously knocked Republicans for their stances on the Violence Against Women Act and who are pushing legislation requiring equal pay for men and women.

The bill's backers supported their charge of ""gendercide,"" the Christian Science Monitor reported, by citing a study showing that an analysis of the third child born to Chinese, Indian, and Korean parents in the U.S. ""strongly suggest[s]"" prenatal sex selection.

But a review of the legislation by the Guttmacher Institute, which promotes reproductive health and rights, argues that such practices are not widespread in the United States and that the studies to support the bill cannot prove that gender-selection abortions are a significant problem, even in particular immigrant communities.

""What is conclusively known,"" wrote Guttmacher's Sneha Barot, ""is that the U.S. sex ratio at birth in 2005 stood at 105 boys to 100 girls, squarely within biologically normal parameters.""

In a vote on May 31, the House bill won a majority of representatives -- 246 votes in favor and 168 against -- but failed because it was considered under a suspension of House rules. That procedure, normally used for non-controversial measures, limits debate and requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass.

Franks said in a news interview before the vote that he expected the measure to fail, but that it was a strategic goal to force Democrats to vote against it.

""I think we’re doing the right thing strategically,"" he told The Washington Post, adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if GOP candidates and conservative groups used the vote to attack Democratic opponents.

Franks was correct on that point. In one subsequent statement, Wurzelbacher described Kaptur as ""supporting abortions based on gender and skin color.""

We contacted Kaptur's campaign. Spokesman Steve Fought said the congresswoman opposed the bill because of privacy issues it raised and its potential consequences.

""How do you prove someone had a gender-based abortion?"" he asked, asserting that the proof would involve medical personnel knowing a woman's reason for an abortion and whether and when she knew the sex of a fetus.

Knowing  the gender of  a fetus would involve sonograms, he said. Medical personnel fearing the possibility of prosecution could reduce the use of sonograms, against the health interest of fetuses, children and mothers -- particularly in the Asian and immigrant communities  the bill targets.

""It was an eminently bad piece of legislation that was introduced strictly for political posturing, under suspension of the rules and not through committee,"" Fought said. ""The video proves that point. It was a show bill. They wanted to get people on the record voting against it so they can demagogue it.""

Where does that leave us?

Wurzelbacher’s statement is accurate. Kaptur did vote against PRENDA. The bill would ban gender-selection abortions.

But additional information is needed for clarification. Kaptur's record on abortion has been consistent. In a story about this vote, Roll Call, a Washington publication, described her as a  Democrat who opposes abortion. 
But in this case, her staff said, concerns about other effects and consequences of the legislation played a role in her vote. And, the bill’s leading sponsor acknowledged that political strategy drove the process under which it was considered.

Julián Castro says Milken Institute named San Antonio nation’s top-performing local economy
","
Second-term San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro did not shy from celebrating his hometown during his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention. 
Addressing the delegates assembled in Charlotte, N.C., Castro said that San Antonio residents recognize the value of investing in pre-Kindergarten and student college loans. ""We're investing in young minds today to be competitive in the global economy tomorow,"" Castro said. ""And it's paying off. Last year the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation's top-performing local economy."" 
Castro made the same claim in his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we’ve previously dipped into twice -- Julián Castro said his city’s investments in infrastructure and education paid off ""late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute.""

Indeed, we confirmed, San Antonio topped Milken’s 2011 list of the nation’s best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the 2007-09 recession.

The economic think tank’s annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for ""more than a decade,"" was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, Texas Tribune news story as ""a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs.""

Milken’s 2011 report on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there. Some measures are weighed across five-year spans, to flatten out extreme swings, and the most recent year, ""to capture recent momentum."" 
  
In recent years, the Tribune said, ""companies have flocked to San Antonio, making it an economic center rivaling Houston and Dallas."" In contrast to those cities, though, ""San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry.""

The Tribune story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain.

The San Antonio Express-News credited the city’s rise to reasons ""including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care"" in a Dec. 16, 2011, news story.

Texas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken’s 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth. Back in 2008, Austin was Texas’ only top-five city, but the state claimed most of those slots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The other chart-toppers for 2011 were No. 2, El Paso; No. 3, Fort Collins/Loveland, Colo.; and No. 5, Killeen/Temple/Fort Hood.

Texas’ rise in the ranks, the Express-News wrote, came partly because of downturns in other parts of the country. The story quoted research economist James Gaines of Texas A&M University’s Real Estate Center: ""Our growth rate and advancement isn't all that wonderful. We've managed to stay flat or have very small positives. But because everybody has so many negatives, we look so much better.""

A Philadelphia Inquirer columnist interviewed Milken’s chief research officer, Ross DeVol, and wrote Dec. 16, 2011 that ""Technology and energy explain why nine Texas cities placed in the top 25 of the 2011 Milken ranking.""

Tom Barrett says gubernatorial rival Scott Walker eliminated economic development office during recession
","
In the wake of a major recession, and with state unemployment stubbornly high, there’s little surprise jobs have been a central focus in the Wisconsin governor’s race.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic nominee, is faulted by Republicans for job losses in the city. And Barrett is slamming Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, his GOP rival, for not doing enough from his office -- and even doing more harm than good.

In a new television ad, titled ""The Difference is Jobs,"" Barrett makes this claim:

Scott Walker ""eliminated his own office of economic development in the middle of this recession.""

That’s a pretty strong shot. But is it true?

Let’s start with the recession piece of this:

While economic times are still unquestionably tough, the official time frame for the Great Recession is December 2007 through June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The Barrett campaign is basing its claim on Walker’s two most recent budgets, for 2009 and 2010.

In the 2009 budget, introduced in September 2008, Walker eliminated the county’s Economic Development Department, moved the seven staff members to other departments and downgraded the director position to a lower level bureaucrat.

""We didn’t eliminate the office that office as much as reassign it,"" Walker said, when asked about the claim. He noted that the economic development activities already were limited -- such as handling real estate deals, low income housing and block grants.

""It represents more of a realistic expectation of what the county is doing,"" Walker said at the time the office was moved. ""We still very much want to play a role.""

In the fall of 2009, Walker switched gears and proposed creating a new county office of business development within his own office as part of the 2010 budget. He called for three staff members and a director. But the County Board approved only the position for the director, deleting the staffers. And it put the post in the Department of Transportation and Public Works.

So, while the Barrett TV ad focuses on Walker’s action, it leaves out an important detail: the board’s involvement in approving -- or blocking -- the executive’s proposals.

Additionally, the ad leaves the impression the county has played a large role in economic development.

To be sure, there are economic development issues facing the county, from development of the County Grounds in Wauwatosa, to the sale of county land in the Park East Corridor in downtown Milwaukee, and increased interest in the area surrounding booming Mitchell International Airport.

But the county has never placed as high a priority on economic development as the city, which has many more tools at its disposal to induce projects, including controls over zoning and the ability to create special tax financing districts. The Department of City Development is one of the most powerful -- and largest -- departments at City Hall.

We turned to Bill Drew for a little insight.

Drew is director of the Milwaukee County Research Park on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. In the past, he served as commissioner of city development and also was director of administration for a time at the county, under former County Executive F. Thomas Ament’s administration. (He has contributed $1,000 to Walker’s gubernatorial campaign).  

What role should the county play?

""The county has struggled to come up with an answer,"" Drew said. ""We’ve been in and out of that business in one way or another since the early ’90s.""

The situation is exacerbated by fighting between the board and the executive.

""It’s the culture of the institution that is causing a problem,"" Drew said. The board and executive have to agree ""on the same vision and make a commitment that’s longer than one year.""

Drew said there hasn’t been a professional economic development specialist at the county since Tim Casey, now economic development coordinator in Brookfield, held the post in the 1990s.

Under Walker, two of his recent selections to lead economic development efforts -- Bob Dennik and Tim Russell -- came from his campaign organization and didn’t last long.

While Barrett’s claim is very specific -- on whether the department was eliminated -- it aims to make a broader point: That Walker has not done what he could have done when it comes to jobs.

So we will delve a little deeper into how the position has been handled.

After the battle over reinstating the office in 2010, Walker could have filled the position starting in January. In August, he hired Damon Dorsey. There was no official announcement of the hiring. It did not become public until it appeared on a County Board committee agenda.

Most recently, Dorsey had worked for the administration of outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle on a proposed $810 million high-speed rail connection -- opposed by Walker -- between Milwaukee and Madison. He made $25 an hour, or $52,200 a year, to assist getting communities involved along the rail line.

In the county job, he will make $80,500 a year.

Dorsey is the former leader of the North Avenue Community Development Corp., which developed several apartment and retail buildings in the central city. In 2007, he developed a commercial building at N. 37th St. and W. North Ave. for a custard and burger stand called Scoopz that was publicly financed in part by the Milwaukee Economic Development Corp. and state Department of Commerce.

The business closed after less than a year, and Dorsey and his wife, Maria, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2009. That case has since been closed. As part of the bankruptcy, Dorsey was required to take a personal financial management class, a routine hurdle required by federal law.

Dorsey said the Scoopz experience shows that he understands the challenges facing businesses in this economic climate.

""I’ve been on the front lines of the war,"" he said. ""I’ve seen the blood.""

So, let’s return to the job -- and claim -- at hand.

To draw a contrast on the critical issue of jobs, Tom Barrett says Scott Walker shut down his economic development office in the midst of a recession. The office did disappear, but in less than a year Walker was already trying to reinstate it -- though the County Board sliced back his plans. While the Barrett TV ad leaves the impression the county’s department was large, economic development has never been a major priority or function of the county.

Tom Ganley's first video ad touts role in FBI investigation
","
Tom Ganley is the largest automobile dealer in Ohio, and the owner of other businesses including insurance, real estate, aviation, and finance companies. But it is a reference to his encounter with organized crime in the 1980s that opens the first TV ad in his GOP campaign for Congress against 13th district Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton:

""An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his business, threatening his family, but he fought back and won the FBI's highest civilian award.""

PolitiFact Ohio earlier gave Ganley a rating of Barely True rating for his claim, in a Sept. 13 interview with The Plain Dealer’s editorial board, that he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio.

That claim overstated his role.

Truth be told, though, we felt bad about putting a mark against Ganley’s reputation in what is, by all accounts, a laudable act: endangering himself in the interest of justice. He was instrumental in helping the Justice Department put several dangerous criminals behind bars.

We wondered whether his overstatement to the newspaper’s editorial board is how he has been portraying his role in the investigation to the public.

Before we get to what we found, we note, in the interest of transparency, that Ganley is a major advertiser in The Plain Dealer.

We did not find that Ganley has overstated his role in the investigation when speaking to the public, although others have. Generally, Ganley has portrayed his role the way he portrays it in his political ad: someone who helped the FBI with an investigation. Our reporting for the earlier PolitiFact item backs up what the TV ad says.

Articles in The Plain Dealer archives show that two organized crime figures -- former Teamsters Union leader John J. (Skip) Felice and Joseph C. Ilaqua -- were sent to prison by U.S. District Judge Alvin I. Krenzler in July 1983 after pleading guilty to conspiring to extort $10,000 and a car from Ganley in 1981 and 1982.

The indictment against Felice said he told Ganley in April 1981 that high ranking organized crime figures wanted Ganley killed, and that Felice could get the contract canceled in exchange for money. Ganley wore a wire when he met with the extortionists and asked questions at the FBI's request to help the bureau crack other cases, former FBI agents said.

""During this investigation, it became evident to these organized crime members that Mr. Ganley was cooperating with the FBI and that he would be testifying against them at trial,"" says a 2007 press release the FBI issued when it gave Ganley its Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award. ""This realization resulted in additional death threats directed at Mr. Ganley and his family. Mr. Ganley refused to be intimidated by these criminals and consented to having FBI agents live at his residence to provide security for himself and his family.""

Retired FBI agents contacted by The Plain Dealer described Ganley’s actions as courageous and important to the FBI’s investigative strategy.

Milwaukee County executive candidate Jim Sullivan says police have to wait for hours with mental health patients
","
During a two-month period in 2004, more than 60 people with mental health emergencies waited for up to 60 hours to get treatment at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Some had to be kept under police guard until they could receive care.

In early 2008, police agencies continued to rack up thousands of dollars in overtime as officers waited in their squad cars or in hospital emergency rooms with patients who needed psychiatric crisis services.

According to Jim Sullivan, one of the five candidates running in the Feb. 15, 2011, primary election for Milwaukee County executive, the problem persists.

In a Jan. 31, 2011 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Sullivan responded to a question about the Mental Health Complex by saying:

""When they’re full up over there, our local police officers -- if you’ve got somebody who needs to be over at mental health because they’re mentally ill, they may pose a danger to themselves, any of these different things -- if it’s full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient in the back and they have to wait to unload and people will, in some cases, spend an entire shift out there doing that.""

If Sullivan is right, police officers are regularly experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex when transporting someone who needs crisis services.

Is he right?

We asked Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa, the basis for his statement. He did not have any direct evidence, but said he heard the Wauwatosa and West Allis police departments experienced such waits.

Thousands of people each year receive crisis care at the complex, 9455 W. Watertown Plank Road. Some are admitted to the 96-bed facility but most are treated and released.

As Sullivan indicated, crisis patients are brought to the facility, often by police, because they are deemed a danger to themselves or others.

The Journal Sentinel’s Patients in Peril investigation has uncovered numerous problems at the complex, from bungled care of patients and staff members falsifying documents to skyrocketing overtime costs.

But delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients have not been in the news recently.

What’s more, Sullivan’s claim about delays is contradicted by an October 2010 study by a national consulting firm, which found that changes made by the county ""have been very effective in reducing backups.""

The finding was reiterated by the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum research organization in a January 2011 report, which summarized issues for candidates in the county executive race.

That report relied, in part, on a November 2010 county memo that showed a dramatic reduction in police waits beginning in 2008.

To further check Sullivan’s statement, we contacted the two police departments he cited as well as the Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office.

Here is what they told us:

Wauwatosa police: Long delays ended five or more years ago and current wait times are usually less than 30 minutes, said Capt. Jeff Sutter. ""It would be extremely unusual for us to have what I consider a long wait,"" he said.

West Allis police: Long waits ended three years ago, according to Chief Mike Jungbluth, who said his officers transport patients to the Mental Health Complex ""every day.""

Milwaukee police: ""We aren’t experiencing the issue anymore,"" said spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz.

Milwaukee County sheriff:  Deputies usually wait about 20 minutes, said Capt. Darlene Jonas. If several officers are trying to get patients treated, the wait time could be one to two hours, she said.

So what’s the bottom line?

Sullivan said delays in admitting people to the Mental Health Complex for crisis care can be so long that police officers spend up to an entire shift with patients waiting for them to receive treatment. Hours-long delays were a problem some years ago. But the four largest police agencies in the county now say waits are short.   

Perhaps there are isolated cases today in which officers waits for hours, but at minimum Sullivan’s claim is clearly dated.

Last fall in the governor’s race, we looked at the Republican primary ad Scott Walker used to equate opponent Mark Neumann with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We labeled Walker’s claim -- ""Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi,"" for shorthand -- and found it False.

Here, Abele’s ad essentially equates Stone with Walker.

So: Does Stone = Walker?

Of course, depending on where a voter sits, the degree of similarity could be considered a good thing or a bad thing.

But it’s worth evaluating, because both sides have made Stone’s ties to Walker a theme -- Stone ran as Walker’s logical successor for most of the race, and Abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense.

We asked the Abele campaign to back up the claim. They provided an analysis of voting records and pointed us to public statements and other evidence.

""They are overwhelmingly similar, and Jeff would represent a continuation of Scott Walker’s approach to governing,"" said Brandon Lorenz, Abele’s spokesman.

We’ll look at Walker and Stones’ statements about each other, as well as their voting histories, common causes, priorities, styles and backgrounds.

Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. They served in the Legislature together for about four years -- even carpooling together -- with Walker taking the higher profile.

Walker is seven years younger, at 43, but they got into elected politics within a year of each other. Stone started locally, as a Greenfield city alderman. Walker, from Wauwatosa, won a state Assembly seat.

Both considered the Milwaukee County exec’s job in 2002 after a pension scandal forced out F. Thomas Ament; only Walker jumped in. Stone helped Walker get elected. Now Stone wants to take over for Walker, and the governor says Stone -- whom he has endorsed and raised campaign money for -- would be a crucial local ally in reducing spending.

Stone and Walker’s statements:

Walker touted Stone in February 2010 as a worthy successor, saying he was ""interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas"" that Walker has backed. That confirmed the impression at the Courthouse, dating back years, that Stone was the GOP’s candidate in waiting.

Stone has consistently praised Walker.

It should be noted though that from the start of his campaign he has said that his small-business experience would make him more focused on job creation than Walker, who Stone said was focused primarily on reforming county government after the pension scandal.

Are they close ideologically and by temperament?

Stone said in March 2011 that he and Walker share ""similar aspirations"" and ""a similarity in how we go about things. He urged a conservative audience: ""Vote for the person who’s going to move Milwaukee County forward along the lines of what Scott Walker has.""

Stone’s pre-primary campaign literature implored voters to back him to preserve gains being made during Walker’s tenure.

At times since Walker’s budget attracted massive protests in Madison this winter, Stone cautiously has tried to separate himself. He has said he will be less confrontational.

""I voted for the budget, but I'm not Scott Walker,"" said Stone. ""I'm Jeff Stone. I have a very different way of managing and doing business.""

Stone voted for Walker’s controversial budget-repair law, but later signaled he would not have tried to sharply curtail union bargaining rights if it had been up to him -- a position that earned him a Half Flip.

He voted for the business tax cuts Walker pushed in January’s special session.

Common Assembly voting history:

Stone and Walker overlapped in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002, when Walker was elected county executive. Stone has operated closer to power during his legislative career than did Walker (1993-2002). Stone served on the Legislature’s  budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Walker made his mark mostly on law enforcement issues.

Research by Abele’s camp on more than 1,400 common votes shows Stone and Walker agreed 96 percent of the time. Stone doesn’t dispute that number.

There’s a limit, though, to how much insight comes from examining a mass of votes by two members of the same party, because most lawmakers vote the party line most of the time, and so many votes are minor.

So we looked at some ratings by a sampling of special interest groups on key legislation. The verdict: Stone and Walker have remarkably similar profiles, though not identical ones. 
Top priorities:

On the issues, Stone has adopted Walker’s signature anti-tax stance and similarly endorses smaller government. Stone and Walker jointly have proposed various tax cuts over the years. Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting.

The most notable difference: public transit.

Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue.

""He’s been a great transit advocate for a decade,"" Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone.

There are limits to Stone’s support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walker’s stance against federal help for a high-speed train.

But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament.

Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion.

Experience:

Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to ""do it my way.""

We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares.

He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that he’s made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker.

Their biggest difference, Stone said, is ""vastly different life experiences and what we’ve done in our career."" Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election.

He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker.

""I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker,"" he said at a candidate forum.

Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Let’s review.

Abele’s strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walker’s agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups.

They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stone’s willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stone’s business experience is a notable biographical difference.

In the end, Abele’s equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/14/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/

Milwaukee County executive candidate Jim Sullivan says police have to wait for hours with mental health patients
","
During a two-month period in 2004, more than 60 people with mental health emergencies waited for up to 60 hours to get treatment at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Some had to be kept under police guard until they could receive care.

In early 2008, police agencies continued to rack up thousands of dollars in overtime as officers waited in their squad cars or in hospital emergency rooms with patients who needed psychiatric crisis services.

According to Jim Sullivan, one of the five candidates running in the Feb. 15, 2011, primary election for Milwaukee County executive, the problem persists.

In a Jan. 31, 2011 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Sullivan responded to a question about the Mental Health Complex by saying:

""When they’re full up over there, our local police officers -- if you’ve got somebody who needs to be over at mental health because they’re mentally ill, they may pose a danger to themselves, any of these different things -- if it’s full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient in the back and they have to wait to unload and people will, in some cases, spend an entire shift out there doing that.""

If Sullivan is right, police officers are regularly experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex when transporting someone who needs crisis services.

Is he right?

We asked Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa, the basis for his statement. He did not have any direct evidence, but said he heard the Wauwatosa and West Allis police departments experienced such waits.

Thousands of people each year receive crisis care at the complex, 9455 W. Watertown Plank Road. Some are admitted to the 96-bed facility but most are treated and released.

As Sullivan indicated, crisis patients are brought to the facility, often by police, because they are deemed a danger to themselves or others.

The Journal Sentinel’s Patients in Peril investigation has uncovered numerous problems at the complex, from bungled care of patients and staff members falsifying documents to skyrocketing overtime costs.

But delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients have not been in the news recently.

What’s more, Sullivan’s claim about delays is contradicted by an October 2010 study by a national consulting firm, which found that changes made by the county ""have been very effective in reducing backups.""

The finding was reiterated by the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum research organization in a January 2011 report, which summarized issues for candidates in the county executive race.

That report relied, in part, on a November 2010 county memo that showed a dramatic reduction in police waits beginning in 2008.

To further check Sullivan’s statement, we contacted the two police departments he cited as well as the Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office.

Here is what they told us:

Wauwatosa police: Long delays ended five or more years ago and current wait times are usually less than 30 minutes, said Capt. Jeff Sutter. ""It would be extremely unusual for us to have what I consider a long wait,"" he said.

West Allis police: Long waits ended three years ago, according to Chief Mike Jungbluth, who said his officers transport patients to the Mental Health Complex ""every day.""

Milwaukee police: ""We aren’t experiencing the issue anymore,"" said spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz.

Milwaukee County sheriff:  Deputies usually wait about 20 minutes, said Capt. Darlene Jonas. If several officers are trying to get patients treated, the wait time could be one to two hours, she said.

So what’s the bottom line?

Sullivan said delays in admitting people to the Mental Health Complex for crisis care can be so long that police officers spend up to an entire shift with patients waiting for them to receive treatment. Hours-long delays were a problem some years ago. But the four largest police agencies in the county now say waits are short.   

Perhaps there are isolated cases today in which officers waits for hours, but at minimum Sullivan’s claim is clearly dated.

Milwaukee County executive candidate Jeff Stone says he’s the only candidate who has voted against increasing government pensions
","
For a scandal that destroyed the political careers of several top Milwaukee County politicians, the 2002 pension deal seems a surprising afterthought in the 2011 county executive campaign.

Have voters forgotten about the whole mess overseen by F. Thomas Ament, who was driven from the county executive’s office by irate voters?

State Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale) hopes not.

He utters the P-word in a radio ad that debuted Feb. 7, 2011. The ad doesn’t mention the Ament scandal directly, but that’s clearly the background for the statement.

""I’m the only candidate for Milwaukee County executive,"" Stone says in the spot, ""that has voted against increasing government pensions.""

Is Stone right about his record and that of the four other candidates in the race?

The five are hoping to replace Scott Walker, who was elected governor in November 2010. The primary election is Feb. 15, 2011.

Let’s start with Stone.

Stone’s ad can’t be talking about the county pension enhancements. He is a former Greenfield alderman and a current state lawmaker. He’s never served on the County Board.

His campaign told us he referred to a 1999 vote in the Legislature on pension sweeteners for nearly 350,000 public employees covered by the Wisconsin Retirement System.

That deal, which estimates at the time said boosted pensions by an average of 10 percent, covered most state and local government workers in Wisconsin, excluding Milwaukee city and county workers who are part of separate pension systems.

Stone did vote against the 1999 state pension package.  

He joined 18 other Republicans (including Walker), and one Democrat, in voting against the enhancements, which passed the Assembly with bipartisan support, 79-20.

Stone told us the sweeteners were too costly and state pensions already were generous enough. However, he has not attempted to waive the benefits for himself; he says the process for doing so is unclear and complicated.

Stone’s radio ad  touched on all the candidates, though, not just his vote.

To our ears, it can be heard two ways.

One: A subtle suggestion that his opponents have cast votes in favor of pension hikes or otherwise favor bigger pensions. Two: Simply underscoring that only Stone faced a tough decision and came down against pension enhancements.

He told us he meant the latter.

""It’s what separates me,"" Stone said. ""It implies they never had the responsibility of making those kinds of decisions"" or voted in favor of increases.

One of Stone’s rivals, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway, did face a similar decision. Holloway was a member of the County Board when the sweeping, Ament-sponsored pension deal came before supervisors in 2000 and 2001.

Holloway voted to approve the Ament deal, which passed easily. In the midst of the scandal, he  survived a recall election. He later waived any personal gain from the benefits.

Holloway points out that he has subsequently voted to cut various pension benefits, increase the retirement age and require employees to contribute 2 percent of their salaries into the pension fund.

As for Stone’s two other main rivals, they have not had an opportunity to vote yes or no on pension improvements.

Jim Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator, took state office years after the vote Stone cites. We could find no pension enhancement votes during Sullivan’s tenure as a public official, including time on the Wauwatosa Common Council. Sullivan could not recall any either.

Asked recently about his view of the Ament deal, Sullivan said: ""The 2002 pension deal was irresponsible and wrong. The people of Milwaukee County deserve better than bloated pensions for bureaucrats and elected officials.  As county executive, I will never allow a deal of this sort to occur.""

A footnote: Sullivan has accepted campaign donations from Ament, as the Journal Sentinel reported.

Another candidate for exec, philanthropist Chris Abele, is making his first bid for public office. So he has not had a chance to vote on anything.

Abele did, however, co-author a 2006 report on the county’s finances in the wake of the pension scandal. He acted in his role as a civic activist and donor, working on a panel set up by the Greater Milwaukee Committee.

That report  bemoaned ""a series of irresponsible pension benefit increases (that) quickly turned a modest pension surplus into a huge pension liability."" It called for changes in health care and pension benefits to help reduce the county’s massive unfunded liabilities.

The fifth candidate, paralegal Ieshuh Griffin, has not held public office before.

Let’s wrap up.

Stone claims that he alone voted against pension increases. Some may argue by making a comparison to rival candidates who have never been in a position to cast votes, he adds a slightly misleading touch to the claim. But the context of it is Stone reciting the virtues of his own resume, not attacking others for shortcomings on theirs.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Leticia Van de Putte']","
Leticia Van de Putte says Algebra II required for Texas students to qualify for college admission under ""top 10 percent"" law
","
In an opinion article that ran in May 2013 in the Austin American-Statesman and other newspapers, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte warns that lawmakers could water down academic expectations for students, reducing college admissions.

In the piece, the San Antonio Democrat suggested that yet-to-be-finalized versions of House Bill 5  would make it more likely that high school students take course loads that run short of preparing them for higher education.

Versions approved by the House and Senate, she wrote, could result in students not taking Algebra II. ""The problem is, Algebra II is required for eligibility in the automatic admissions program for Texas universities (aka the Top 10 Percent program),"" Van de Putte said.

We wondered if a student has to clear Algebra II to be considered under the 1997 automatic admission law, which entitles any graduate of a Texas high school ranking in the top 10 percent of his or her class, based on grade point average, to enroll at any of the state’s 38 public universities. (In 2009, lawmakers gave the University of Texas permission to limit automatically admitted students to 75 percent of its slots for freshmen from Texas. In recent years, that has meant students had to rank in the top 8 or 9 percent to be entitled to automatic admission to the Austin flagship.)

And does Algebra II figure in?

According to an information sheet posted online by the Texas Education Agency, a student is eligible for automatic admission under the law if he or she earned a grade point average in the top 10 percent of his or her graduating class. The student also must have met one of these two conditions:

—  Completed courses required under the state’s ""recommended"" or ""distinguished achievement"" graduation plans. Algebra II, we confirmed, is among the courses students must pass to graduate under those plans.

— Tested well enough on the ACT or SAT, which students take while applying to college. Specifically, students must have ""satisfied ACT’s College Readiness Benchmarks on the ACT assessment or earned on the SAT assessment a score of at least 1,500 out of 2,400 or the equivalent.""

So, one path to college admission under the 10 percent law requires Algebra II and the other path doesn’t.

Dominic Chavez, a staff spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, told us the board does not have information on students who took the alternate path, but he said they probably comprise a ""microscopic"" share of all students seeking admission under the ""top 10 percent"" law ""since overall only 24% of all Texas students meet the ACT college readiness benchmarks.""

Chavez said it would ""be very difficult to meet the math benchmarks without taking Algebra II. Not impossible, but not very likely.""

Ed Colby, a spokesman for the Iowa-based ACT program, said by phone that the organization recommends that students take a minimum of three years of high school math, starting with Algebra I. Nationally in 2012, Colby said, 8 percent of students who reported taking less than three years of high-school math scored well enough on the ACT to meet its college readiness benchmarks in math; 13 percent of Texas students who took less than three years of such math met those benchmarks.

We asked the University of Texas at Austin about the number of its students admitted thanks solely to their class ranks and SAT or ACT scores. By email, campus spokesman Gary Susswein said there is no way to determine that without a record-by-record search, but the share of Texas high-school graduates who enrolled at the university in fall 2012 without passing Algebra II was ""minuscule."" Broadly, he said, 89 percent of the admitted Texans had taken courses including Algebra II, while many of the remaining 11 percent had attended private high schools that certified their graduation requirements as including Algebra II, he said.

By email, Nichols of Van de Putte’s office conceded that state law includes the ACT/SAT alternative path to gaining consideration under the ""top 10 percent"" mandate. But it’s a little-used ""escape hatch,"" Nichols wrote. In reality, he said, ""nobody plans to take the minimum (graduation) plan and then hope for a good test score. In reality, those hoping to qualify for top 10 percent need to take Algebra II.""

Nichols noted too that according to the coordinating board, 99 percent of students who enrolled in the state’s public universities from fall 2009 through fall 2011 had completed Algebra II--and 1 percent or fewer won admission without it.

Our ruling

Van de Putte said students must pass Algebra II to be eligible for college admission under the state’s ""top 10 percent"" law.

Algebra II is among courses built into the state’s recognized or distinguished achievement graduation plans, which both qualify a graduate for consideration under the 10-percent law. But the law also enables a student to win consideration without taking Algebra II and other college-oriented courses by doing well on the ACT or SAT.

Practically speaking, it makes sense to us that most high-ranking graduates seeking admission to the state’s public universities have taken Algebra II. However, it’s simply not required to qualify for consideration under the ""top 10 percent"" law, making this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/21/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-algebra-ii-required-texa/

Michele Bachmann decries “huge national database” run by IRS with ""personal, intimate"" health care details
","During a recent interview with Fox News, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., raised the specter of the Internal Revenue Service -- an agency currently under fire for appearing to target conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status -- collecting a database full of ""intimate"" details about Americans. Referring to an inspector general’s report on IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, ""So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care. There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible."" We’ve already rated two of her claims from this exchange, which came during a May 15, 2013, interview on the Fox News show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. We gave Bachmann a False for saying that the IRS is ""going to be in charge of our health care,"" and we gave her a Mostly False for her claim that ""The IRS will have the ability potentially"" to deny or delay health care. In this item, we’ll focus on whether it’s correct to say that the IRS is going to be in charge of ""a huge national database"" on health care that will include Americans’ ""personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets."" After the interview with Van Susteren aired, Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, told PolitiFact that she stands by her charge. As evidence, he cited a passage from a Wall Street Journal editorial published one day before her television appearance. The editorial described a Federal Data Services hub that is taking ""the IRS's own records (for income and employment status) and centralizing them with information from Social Security (identity), Homeland Security (citizenship), Justice (criminal history), HHS (enrollment in entitlement programs and certain medical claims data) and state governments (residency). The data hub will be used as the verification system for ObamaCare's complex subsidy formula. ... ""Good luck in advance to anyone who gets caught in this system's gears, assuming it even works. Centralizing so much personal information in one place is another invitation for the IRS wigglers in some regional office—or maybe higher up—to make political decisions about enforcement."" We see four key questions for fact-checking Bachmann’s claim. First, is the government constructing a database? Second, will the IRS be ""in charge"" of it? Third, would it include ""personal"" or ""intimate"" details? And fourth, would it affect all, or most, Americans? We’ll take these issues in order. Is the government constructing a database? Not by the traditional definition of ""database."" The ""hub"" the government is creating is a mechanism for extracting data from a variety of databases that exist at other agencies. The hub doesn’t collect, centralize and store data; it is designed to allow real-time access to data that resides on the servers of other agencies in order to verify transactions related to the health insurance exchanges created under Obama’s law. In an April 22, 2013, release, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a part of HHS, said that it has completed the hub’s technical design and is in the midst of testing it. ""The hub will not store consumer information, but will securely transmit data between state and federal systems to verify consumer application information,"" the center said in the statement. HHS pledges ""strict privacy controls to safeguard personal information,"" added Brian Cook, a spokesman for the department. ""This is not a huge national database of health records,"" said Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for Internet freedom. Will the IRS be ""in charge"" of the hub? No. It’s being built by HHS, specifically by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. To ensure compatibility, the IRS needs to cooperate with HHS on the effort, but the IRS has only a supporting role in building the system, and the IRS will not be able to use the hub to view information in the other agencies’ databases. Will the hub include ""personal"" or ""intimate"" details? The hub is not designed to access, much less store, information like body mass index, or whether you have a serious illness or ingrown toenails. The hub will be able to tell if someone has insurance or not, but it will not access records about their health. It could access other ""personal"" details beyond health status, including adjusted gross income and Social Security numbers, but those already exist in federal databases, so the hub wouldn’t represent an expansion of federal data collection. Would the hub affect all, or most Americans? No. The data won’t be accessed by the hub unless an individual logs on to the new insurance exchanges in order to purchase insurance. An estimated 28.6 million Americans might be eligible for health insurance subsidies on the exchange in 2014, though the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that many fewer Americans will actually sign up, at least at first -- 6 million in 2014 and 22 million in 2017. So the numbers of Americans who might eventually interact with the hub aren’t trivial -- but it’s important to note that even if everyone who’s eligible takes the opportunity to use the exchanges, they would represent a small fraction of all Americans. People who have employer-provided insurance or are on Medicare, Medicaid, veterans health care or most other forms of government-provided insurance should have no need to interact with the hub at all. Our ruling Bachmann said the IRS is going to be ""in charge"" of ""a huge national database"" on health care that will include Americans’ ""personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets."" The congresswoman chooses to believe that the IRS and the rest of the government intend to delve ever-further into Americans’ personal lives. We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but as best we can tell now, she has mischaracterized the intent and limitations of the hub. It’s not a ""database."" The IRS isn’t running it. It won’t include ""intimate"" health data. And most Americans won’t need to interact with it at all.

Gov. Rick Scott says he is almost halfway done with '700,000 jobs' promise
","
To hear Gov. Rick Scott tell it, his memorable campaign pledge to create 700,000 jobs in seven years is going right along schedule. 
The novice politician, almost two and a half years into his first term, says things are looking bright for the Sunshine State as a result of investments in economic development and public education. 
""Our unemployment rate has now dropped to 7.2 percent – well below the national average, and we are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years,"" Scott wrote in a letter explaining line-item vetoes in the 2013-14 state budget. 
As much as we love belting Bon Jovi anthems -- WHOAAAAA, we’re halfway there! -- it’s premature to sing Scott’s praises for fulfilling half of the jobs he promised in the centerpiece of his 2010 campaign. 
Our qualm with this claim comes down to details about his pledge that he has since abandoned. These details that may not fit in a zippy campaign ad, but they do come straight from Scott’s mouth. 
The promise at hand is rated Stalled on the Scott-O-Meter despite the state adding 302,500 net jobs since December 2010. This factors in Scott’s first month in office, January 2011. Excluding that month puts the jobs total at 285,100. The size of the state’s employment pool in April 2013 is about the same as it was in July 2004, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Why is it Stalled? Because Scott told us in a debate and in press accounts that his 700,000 jobs would come on top of Florida’s normal growth as it added jobs lost during the recession. State economists expected the state to add about 1 million jobs by 2017. 
""It's on top of that,"" he told a reporter in 2010. ""If you do these things, we're going to grow 700,000 more jobs."" 
So Scott needs about 1.4 million more jobs by 2017 to fulfill his original promise of 1.7 million jobs. Through 28 months in office, the state has added less than 20 percent of the jobs he needs to meet that mark. 
Scott’s press office has consistently disagreed with our analysis, saying Scott’s campaign materials never qualified that 700,000 jobs would be on top of normal growth projections. 
In a response to our inquiry about this claim, spokeswoman Jackie Schutz asked us to note the state’s unemployment rate of 7.2 percent is below the national average of 7.5 percent for the second straight month. 
That, for the record, is correct. 
Our ruling 
Scott said the state is ""already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years."" 
By his preferred measure since taking office -- 700,000 jobs regardless of normal growth -- he’s in the ballpark. 
By the measure he asked Floridians to hold him accountable to -- 700,000 jobs on top of 1 million jobs in normal growth -- he still has quite a long ways to go. 
We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/20/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-sticking-altered-700000-jobs-promis/

Michele Bachmann says the IRS is ""going to be in charge of our health care""
","
Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. is one of a number of Republican lawmakers who have recently sought to link the two longtime targets of conservatives -- the Internal Revenue Service and President Barack Obama’s health care law. 
In a May 15, 2013, interview with Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren, Bachmann invoked an inspector general’s report critical of the IRS’ scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. 
She said, ""So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care. There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers’ health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible."" 
We’ll be looking at a few claims from this exchange. In this item, we’ll look at whether there’s support for her claim that the IRS is ""going to be in charge of our health care."" 
The IRS has a number of roles in implementing the health care law -- the agency has posted a list that includes everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Its best known role, beginning in 2014, is to confirm that a taxpayer has health insurance and to assess a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) 
In another fact-check, we discussed another key role for the IRS -- approving subsidies for Americans seeking insurance on the newly created health exchanges. To do this, the IRS will need to check its databases to make sure an applicant is eligible to receive subsidies. 
But while we noted that any technical failures in carrying out this task could be problematic, it would be a huge stretch to say that this power puts the IRS ""in charge of our health care."" 
For one thing, most Americans will not see any dramatic change in how they obtain insurance, since the law leaves in place the existing system of health coverage provided by employers. In fact, in 2010, we chose the claim that the law amounts to a ""government takeover of health care"" as our Lie of the Year. To claim that one portion of the government -- the IRS -- is going to run health care is even more far-fetched. The IRS will have nothing to do with the nuts-and-bolts provision of health care to Americans. 
Even among federal agencies, the law puts far more responsibility in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The department’s Web page on the health care law says that ""HHS is responsible for implementing many of the health reform changes included in the Affordable Care Act,"" including ""significant roles"" for an alphabet soup of HHS offices, including the Administration on Aging, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
The duties of the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the health care law is expansive enough to fill a 5-foot by 10-foot chart, according to an op-ed by Mike Leavitt, who held the office under President George W. Bush. ""It puts more power than is prudent in the hands of one person,"" Leavitt wrote. 
Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, explained her comment by saying that ""the Supreme Court ruled that Obamacare only meets the constitutionality standard as a tax, and the entity in the United States that enforces tax policy is the IRS. If you don’t comply with Obamacare’s individual mandate, you will be answering to the IRS. That is clearly the context she’s talking within because she had just said, ‘The IRS, Greta, is the chief enforcer of Obamacare.’"" 
But several health policy experts agreed that’s not the same as the IRS being ""in charge of our health care."" 
William McBride, an economist with the business-backed Tax Foundation, said the IRS has been tasked with ""a tremendous amount"" and that the agency is in ""uncharted territory,"" but he added that he doubts the IRS ""will effectively control much of anything related to health care."" 
Other health policy specialists were even more blunt. ""Not accurate,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who is now a health policy consultant. It’s a ""ludicrous statement,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. 
Our ruling 
Bachmann said the IRS is ""going to be in charge of our health care."" The IRS does play a number of key roles under the health care law, but it’s wrong to say it would ""be in charge"" of any American’s health care. The IRS won’t oversee interactions between doctors and patients, nor will it play any more of a role than confirming that exchange purchasers qualify for subsidies. Even within the government, HHS plays a much bigger role. We rate Bachmann’s claim False.",/factchecks/2013/may/20/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-irs-going-be-charge-our-heal/

Michele Bachmann says IRS ""will have the ability"" to delay or deny health care
","
Last week was a bad one for the Internal Revenue Service. First, it faced widespread criticism over revelations that officials gave extra scrutiny to tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Now, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is charging that the IRS may be able to deny Americans the right to health care. 
During a May 15, 2013, interview on Fox News’ On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, Bachmann linked the IRS to a longtime target of hers, President Barack Obama’s health care law. 
Referring to an inspector general’s report on the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, ""So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible."" 
We’ll be looking at a few claims from this exchange. In this item, we’ll focus on whether it’s accurate to say that ""the IRS will have the ability potentially"" to deny or delay health care. 
In an interview with PolitiFact after Bachmann’s appearance on Van Susteren’s show, Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, said she stood by the concerns she expressed. 
""Now that we know the IRS has abused its power for political purposes, it is reasonable to ask what other steps would they take to punish their political opponents,"" Kotman said. This is an especially big concern, Kotman said, in the wake of revelations that Sarah Hall Ingram -- the former commissioner of the IRS' tax-exempt and government-entities division -- is now in charge of an IRS office that oversees tax-related issues relating to the health care law. 
Kotman argued that it would be possible for the IRS to use the information it collects on taxpayers and their health coverage for political purposes. ""Based on that information, one possible outcome is that they can levy punitive taxes that could force employers to drop coverage,"" Kotman said. 
The IRS has a number of roles in implementing the health care law -- the agency has posted a list that includes everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Its best known role, beginning in 2014, is to confirm that a taxpayer has health insurance and to assess a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) 
None of the above, however, supports the idea that the IRS can ""deny"" or ""delay"" health care for an individual or a family. 
But there is one area in which IRS actions could delay Americans from getting health care. It stems from the agency’s role in approving federal subsidies for purchasing health insurance on the newly created insurance exchanges. 
Let’s recap how this part of the law works. The law establishes ""exchanges"" that are intended to be operational by 2014. Using these exchanges, people who need insurance will be able to comparison-shop for plans that suit their needs. While some people will pay all of the resulting premiums, many will qualify for subsidies. 
The subsidies operate on a sliding scale, and are available to those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. An estimated 28.6 million Americans might be eligible for the subsidies in 2014, though the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that many fewer Americans will actually sign up, at least at first -- 6 million in 2014 and 22 million in 2017. 
Even if the lower estimates of signup rates are true, that will mean that millions of Americans will need to secure approval from the IRS to obtain subsidies. This process is supposed to start this fall, to enable applicants to purchase coverage in time for calendar year 2014. 
So will the IRS be ready? An IRS spokeswoman said the agency ""is on track with implementing its role in the Affordable Care Act,"" but otherwise directed inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
In a statement to PolitiFact, HHS said applicants for financial assistance will be part of the exchange process and that verification ""will take place in near-real time"" with several federal databases, including an IRS database. 
Experts we contacted for this story said that Bachmann’s scenario -- that the IRS picks and chooses who gets a subsidy based on an applicant’s political beliefs -- is almost impossible to imagine, even after the recent revelations. 
But they said it was more plausible that mundane logistical challenges could delay individuals’ efforts to secure subsidies. At a bureaucracy as large as the IRS, and with laws as complicated as this one, it’s possible that individuals could -- indirectly and inadvertently -- find themselves delayed or denied in getting health coverage. 
It’s not hard to imagine glitches cropping up and delaying someone from getting approval to purchase insurance on the exchange. It could be especially tricky for Americans who don’t file returns because they don’t owe taxes beyond what’s taken from their paycheck. We ""don’t know what will happen if the IRS is unable to make these determinations in a ‘timely' way,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who is now a health policy consultant. 
And even in the best of situations, computer systems aren’t perfect. ""One big concern about whether the exchanges will work is whether computers from different government agencies can talk to each other,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. Brookings Institution senior fellow Elaine Kamarck recently suggested a possible scenario in which the federal online system for exchanges ""may not be able to interface with statewide data and eligibility could become a lengthy bureaucratic process."" 
We should emphasize that if these delays do come to pass, it won’t be about ""political beliefs,"" as Bachmann put it, and it won’t be something IRS intended to happen. It would be about something much more mundane -- bureaucratic snags. 
""She is trying to make the IRS sound like it has a malevolent power to limit medical care that it does not have,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. 
Our ruling 
Bachmann said ""the IRS will have the ability potentially"" to deny or delay health care. She makes it sound like the IRS would purposefully deny or delay people from getting health coverage, perhaps based on an applicant’s political beliefs. Experts told us that was extremely far-fetched. But if complicated logistical challenges are not met, there is a chance that IRS could inadvertently end up delaying some of the millions of uninsured Americans seeking subsidies from purchasing insurance on the exchanges.

Fulton leader uses tax rate to make case in battle with state lawmakers
","
The year was 1991. 
U.S. military forces ousted Saddam Hussein’s troops from Kuwait in what was called Operation Desert Storm. The Atlanta Braves thrilled the city with an improbable World Series appearance. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" won the Oscar for Best Picture. Basketball legend Michael Jordan won his first pro championship. 
And Fulton County commissioners raised the millage rate, causing property taxes -- and anger -- to rise in Georgia’s highest-populated county. 
Now, Fulton officials are upset with state lawmakers, who passed a series of bills this year that the lawmakers believe will improve county operations. County Chairman John Eaves made the argument that Fulton is a well-run county in a recent television interview. 
""The facts are Fulton County has not increased its millage rate since 1991,"" Eaves told Channel 2 Action News’ Lori Geary. ""So why fix something that’s not broken?"" 
PolitiFact Georgia was curious whether Eaves was indeed correct about his claim that county commissioners haven’t raised the millage rate in more than two decades. 
For several years, Republican state lawmakers from north Fulton have battled with the Democratic-led County Commission over the direction of the county government. Many of the lawmakers and their constituents say they’re not getting their money’s worth in services for the taxes they pay. There’s been talk, and unsuccessful legislation at the state level, to split Fulton into two counties. Fulton has 920,583 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census. 
The tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.281 mills, which equates to about $720 on a $250,000 home with a homestead exemption. But total property taxes in Fulton vary, depending on what part of the county the property is located. Cities add their own millage rates, increasing the overall rate. Then, there are other charges for bond payments, the county’s school system and other services. Fulton’s school board sets its own property tax rate. 
In 1991, county commissioners voted 4-3 to raise property taxes. Then Chairman Michael Lomax said the increase was necessary to help fund Grady Memorial Hospital. Some residents unsuccessfully tried to recall Lomax. Eaves was first elected as chairman in 2006. 
Since 1991, the county government’s millage and bond rate has gradually declined. In 2011, though, it rose from 10.28 mills to 10.55 mills to help fund a library construction program. Fulton voters passed the proposed $275 million library program in 2008. Fulton public affairs manager Jessica Corbitt told us the increase of 0.27 mills was to the bond millage rate, not the general fund millage rate. It was listed on Fulton tax bills as a separate millage rate. 
The county chairman’s comments, though, do not reflect some property tax changes in a portion of Fulton. 
The county has a Special Services District for a portion of its south Fulton residents. The Georgia Legislature created the district in 2006 after the cities of Chattahoochee Hills, Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs were all created. South Fulton leaders pushed for the district to ensure funding for services in that portion of the county as those cities, most of them in the north, were being created. 
The millage rate for the South Fulton Special Services District was 5.73 mills in 2006, county financial records show. It declined slightly to 5.66 mills in 2007 and 2008. The rate rose sharply in 2009 to 8.16 mills, the records show. It went up in 2011 to 8.97 mills and again in 2012 to 10.47 mills. 
The county said in its 2012 budget book that the most recent increase was primarily due to lower assessments on property values and that the county needed the additional money to maintain the same level of service to residents there. The increases are a direct result of the defections of Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs, as well as plummeting property values brought on by the Great Recession, county officials have said. 
Corbitt confirmed the accuracy of the financial records. She defended Eaves’ statement in the television interview. 
""While it is true that the millage rate has increased for the special services district, which serves approximately 10 percent of the county’s population, the discussions related to the Fulton County legislation have primarily focused on the Countywide General Fund. With regard to the General Fund, the Chairman’s statement is completely accurate,"" Corbitt said via email. 
To sum up, Eaves said the county has not increased its millage rate since 1991. But the millage rate in the South Fulton Special Services Fund, which affects about 90,000 people, has increased several times in recent years. 
Corbitt said the south Fulton millage rate increases are not relevant to the ongoing debate. Still, Eaves would have been more precise if he had specified the difference. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/20/john-eaves/fulton-leader-uses-tax-rate-make-case-state-battle/

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says state report projects half of public employees would live outside city if residency rule is lifted
","
Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is marshalling a big number as he continues his uphill battle to save a requirement that city employees reside in Milwaukee. 
Fifty. As in 50 percent. 
A frustrated Barrett met May 10, 2013, with Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, a day after an altered version of Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s proposal to wipe out all local residency rules for public employees won Joint Finance Committee approval. Republicans control both houses of the Legislature and the committee action suggests it will pass. 
Barrett repeated his concern that many of the city’s 7,200 city employees would move if residency is lifted, leading to a drop in property values. 
And he said there’s hard evidence of just how many. 
When asked ""How many people do you think will actually leave in 10 years?"" Barrett pointed to what he called a ""projection"" by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. 
The mayor quoted the state projection as ""approximately half of public employees"" living outside city limits will leave within 10 years. Barrett didn’t specify whether the state prediction was limited to Milwaukee or all municipalities that would have to dump residency rules, but the context of the question was clearly Milwaukee. 
When we asked Barrett spokeswoman Jodie Tabak for backup, she cited a May 9, 2013, fiscal bureau memo that examined the issue and laid out possible alternatives to Walker’s proposal. 
That memo at one point examined the possible economic impact of lifting residency for Milwaukee city employees. 
It did so by looking briefly at two large Midwestern cities with vastly different economies that lifted residency rules in 1999: Detroit and Minneapolis. (In both cases state lawmakers mandated the end to the municipal rules -- as Wisconsin lawmakers now seek to do.) 
Fifty-three percent of Detroit’s police force now lives outside the city, according to the fiscal bureau memo. That figure was reported by PolitiFact Wisconsin in 2011, when Republicans considered ending residency but pulled back. We rated as Mostly Truea Barrett claim that 53 percent of Detroit’s police force moved out when residency there was lifted. 
The fiscal bureau memo also focused on Minneapolis. 
""Recent estimates indicate that the percentage of city employees residing in the City has declined from nearly 70% when the requirement was in place to only 30% now,"" the memo said. (The Minneapolis residency requirement was only in place for six years, so not all employees were subject to it by 1999 when the rule was lifted.) 
Tabak said Barrett was referring to the Detroit and Minneapolis numbers when he made his claim. 
Barrett, though, said the fiscal bureau report contained a ""projection"" of what would happen here. 
Here’s the state memo’s only stab at that: 
""While the actual level of out-migration of public employees from the City of Milwaukee can only be speculated on at this point, two recent examples of other major Midwestern, U.S. cities that lifted their residency requirement may provide some insight,"" it said. 
Essentially, the memo said the Detroit and Minneapolis experiences could be suggestive, but it offered no prediction on Milwaukee’s ""actual level."" 
Tabak noted that the memo says: ""Given that public employees, their unions, and associations want relief from the residency requirements in Milwaukee, it would seem somewhat evident that providing that relief could lead to some number of those public employees migrating out of the City."" 
But that doesn’t tell us much, at least not in terms of a percentage. 
Before we wrap up, we should note that we found another example of a city that saw state lawmakers end residency requirements more than a decade ago: Baltimore, in 1995. 
As of 2012, 47% of Baltimore’s city workers lived outside the city, according to data on Open Baltimore. Among police employees, that spikes to 77 percent. 
So, in the three cities, large chunks of the workforce -- or at least the police force -- have chosen to live outside city limits a decade or more after the repeal of residency. Right around half of workers in fact; more in the case of Baltimore cops. 
But those figures look backward, at other cities. Barrett’s claim went further, saying a state memo forecasts a similar effect here -- approximately half, he said. 
There’s an element of truth in his statement, in that the state memo said the experience elsewhere ""may provide some insight"" into Milwaukee’s fate. And the experience in other cities may well play out here over time. 
But the state report stops well short of predicting Milwaukee’s experience. The mayor overreached in claiming an independent state report put a number on that. 
We rate Barrett’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/19/tom-barrett/milwaukee-mayor-tom-barrett-says-state-report-proj/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Barbara Buono voted for increases in taxes, fees 154 times, ad claims
","The gloves are off. Chris Christie may be more popular than ever, but the Republican isn’t taking any chances with seeking re-election in a majority Democrat state. Witness a new TV ad released Monday by his re-election campaign, Christie for Governor. The ad starts off with pictures of Christie’s Democratic challenger, state Sen. Barbara Buono, as a narrator introduces her as former Gov. Jon Corzine’s budget chair. Buono chaired the Senate’s Budget and Appropriations Committee for two years during Corzine’s tenure. ""Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes -- like the sales tax, the income tax, health care taxes, even small business taxes,"" the narrator states as text in the commercial states she voted to raise taxes and fees. This ad is a variation on a theme mentioned previously by Christie, and it’s also right on target. First, some background about tax increases. During his State of the State address earlier this year Christie noted that New Jersey saw more than 100 increases in taxes and fees in the eight years before he became governor, which is similar to the new TV ad about Buono, the Democratic challenger in the November gubernatorial race. In addition, state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. (R-Westfield) made a similar claim in an Oct. 7, 2011 news release when he tied 115 votes for tax increases to jobs leaving New Jersey. Kean’s claim was rated Half True. For both previous fact-checks, Republicans provided us with a list that included tax and fee hikes as well as tax policy changes that occurred between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. Now let’s review the 154 increases. The Christie for Governor camp provided us with a list of the 154 increases they claim Buono supported both in the Senate and when she served in the Assembly. We reviewed each vote and found that the list given us mirrors the previous Republican-provided lists, plus additional votes. Although Democrats sponsored most of the bills in question, a few had Republican support. Democrats held legislative majorities in the eight years before Christie became governor. His predecessors during that time were Jim McGreevey, Richard Codey and Corzine. Among the increases were raising the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent and applying the tax to services such as tanning and limousine rides; increases in the cigarette tax; and allowing towns to impose parking taxes and surcharges. Also, the state twice increased the gross income tax on New Jerseyans with six-figure incomes: in 2004 for those with income exceeding $500,000 and again in 2009 for those incomes above $400,000. In addition to tax increases were hikes in dozens of fees, such as a new $1.50 fee on the sale of new vehicle tires; imposing fees on certain realty transfers; on hotel/motel occupancies; increases in the minimum casino hotel parking charge; and raising the fee to file for divorce. Overall, the lists provided by Republicans showed that there were dozens of increases in taxes or fees or other tax policy changes that could result in individuals or businesses paying higher taxes. We calculated the votes and confirmed that Buono did vote 154 times in favor of higher taxes and fees. After we shared the list with Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner, we received a list back pointing out cuts that Christie has made to various tax credit rebates and programs; legislation the governor signed resulting in assessments on ambulatory care facilities and insurers; and other legislation signed by Christie allowing government authorities to charge fees. ""Barbara Buono has spent her life in public service fighting for New Jersey's middle class and working people,"" Turner said in an e-mail. ""Throughout her career she has pushed to make large corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share and reduce the tax burden on New Jersey's working families. And she has consistently voted to hold lawbreakers accountable—if Governor Christie believes it was wrong to stiffen penalties for deadbeat dads, impose tougher fines on tax cheats and force polluters to help pay for damaging our environment and threatening public health, he should say so.""   Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts declined comment. Our ruling A Christie for Governor TV ad claims, ""Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes -- like the sales tax, the income tax, health care taxes, even small business taxes."" Although a narrator only mentions tax increases, scrolling text in the ad also mentions fee increases. And in this case, the ad is accurate: Buono did vote on 154 bills that would increase fees and taxes on things ranging from the purchase of new vehicle tires to those New Jerseyans earning six-figure incomes exceeding $400,000.

U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says only 83 percent of income is subject to Social Security tax, down from about 90 percent historically
","
The question of how to properly finance Social Security was one of the topics when U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was interviewed on WPRI's ""Newsmakers,"" which aired May 12, 2013. 
Cicilline expressed support for one proposal that would eliminate the limit on the Social Security payroll tax. Currently, employees stop paying the 6.2-percent tax for the year once their income hits $113,700. Applying the tax to everyone regardless of their income would keep Social Security solvent for the next 75 years, according to the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. 
On ""Newsmakers,"" Cicilline said more and more income is now exempt from the tax. 
""Social Security used to be a tax which was assessed on approximately 90 percent of the income generated in this country, which was where it has sort of been historically. It currently collects taxes on about 83 percent of wages earned because the cap . . . only captures 83 percent of earnings because there's been such a growth of income at the very top,"" the congressman said. 
We were interested in seeing if his percentages were correct. 
We didn't get an immediate response from his office, so we went looking on our own. 
According to a Social Security ""Policy Brief"" from 2011, and other sources, Social Security sometimes refers to this limit as the ""tax max."" It's been the subject of a lot of tinkering since the 1930s, when it was set at $3,000. The tax rate then was just one percent. 
The tax max started going up in 1951. Annual increases began in 1972. The tax rate itself started to rise in 1950. It has been 6.2 percent since 1990. 
Returning to Cicilline's statement, we found that he got a key number wrong. 
He said that, historically, 90 percent of income was subject to the Social Security tax. In fact, 83 percent is the average proportion of wages subjected to the tax from the founding of Social Security through 2009. For several years during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s it was below 80 percent, dropping to 71 percent in 1965. 
The percentage peaked at 90 percent in only two years -- 1982 and 1983. It's been on the decline since then. It was about 86 percent in 2010. 
Cicilline's office subsequently sent us two reports that confirmed the 90 percent represents a historical peak, not an average. 
One was a 2010 document from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which predicted that the rate would hit 83 percent around 2014. The other was a compilation of statistical tables from the Social Security Administration showing that the 2011 rate was expected to be 83 percent, as Cicilline said. 
The reports showed something else. 
Since 1983, about 6 percent of the population each year has earned enough money to reach the cap and stop paying Social Security taxes that year. The fact that the percentage has changed very little (yet the amount of wages subjected to the Social Security tax has steadily declined) shows that the wealthiest Americans have been seeing less and less of their income subjected to the tax, which was Cicilline's other point. 
As the 2011 policy brief concluded, ""The percentage of earnings covered by the tax max has fallen since the early 1980s because earnings among above-max earners have grown faster than earnings among the rest of the working population."" 
One final interesting note for the folks in Cicilline's home state: the Congressional Research Service report has a state-by-state breakdown of the percentage of workers with income subject to the Social Security tax who exceeded the limit in 2007. Rhode Island had the fewest workers -- only 1.6 percent in that category. South Dakota was next to the bottom, at 2.1 percent. New Jersey was highest at 11.6 percent. 
Our ruling 
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said only 83 percent of wages are being subjected to the Social Security tax when, historically, it has been 90 percent. 
Analyses by the Social Security Administration and the Congressional Research Service show that he is on the mark for the current rate of taxation, but 90 percent applies to only two years in the 1980s. It has been declining since then, as better-paid Americans have seen their incomes grow at a faster rate than other workers. 
The judges felt that Cicilline needed to get both facts correct to make his point. When a key part of his premise turns out to be inaccurate, his overarching argument fails. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Is paid maternity leave really the standard around the world?
","
Family Forward Oregon and other advocates of paid leave descended on the state Capitol this month with a Mother’s Day message for legislators: Want to be really mom-friendly? Skip the nosegays and pass legislation mandating paid maternity leave. 
""Mothers' work opportunities, health, and bonds with their children and partners are affected by the lack of paid family leave -- a program that is standard in all but five nations around the world,"" read a section of the flier distributed to lawmakers. 
We’ll be upfront. PolitiFact Oregon found it hard to believe developing nations could offer a work-related benefit that the United States does not. We were eager to truth squad this claim. 
Lisa Frack, spokeswoman for Family Forward Oregon, shared two sources: An infographic at the Huffington Post website and a New York Times article. Both remarked on our nation’s poor showing on paid leave for moms. We also did some online searching of our own and found that, apparently, it’s well known that the United States is out-of-step with developed nations when it comes to federal law mandating paid maternity leave. 
Private companies set their own policies, and employers such as Google offer generous leave programs to retain new mothers. States can also set their own rules. California and New Jersey require paid leave for new moms. Washington approved a paid leave requirement, but has yet to find a way to pay for it. 
But the default is the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which calls for larger employers and government to allow a qualifying worker to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to have a baby or to care for a sick family member. Oregon law broadens the unpaid leave mandate to more employers and for more purposes, but there remain employees who don’t qualify or who can’t afford to take time off. 
Now, what about those other countries? The Central Intelligence Agency world fact book indicates there are about 267 ""world entities,"" and of those, 193 are United Nations member states. The World Policy Analysis Center, housed in UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, confirmed policies for 188 of those countries. 
""Only the U.S., Papua New Guinea, Suriname, and 4 small Pacific islands (Nauru, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga) don’t guarantee mothers paid leave from work to care for their infant,"" wrote Amy Raub, principal research analyst with the World Policy Analysis Center, in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. 
Earlier news reports say the United States is one in three that lacks paid leave for new mothers. Family Forward has stated in a separate press release that we are one of four nations, not five. We’re not going to focus on the exact number -- except to remind speakers that sometimes, a general figure is better than a specific -- because it’s enough to say we are in the minority. Like, really in the minority. 
According to the center, even North Korea, which is ruled by a dictator, offers 11 weeks of paid maternity leave. Iraq, which was ruled by a dictator until 2003, offers nine weeks of paid leave. Bangladesh, where garment workers receive a minimum wage of $38 a month, offers 16 weeks of paid leave. Afghanistan requires 13 weeks, Pakistan 12 weeks. 
Which raises this question: How can working conditions for women -- in this respect -- be considered better in those countries than in the United States? 
We combed through an exhaustive 2010 report issued by the International Labour Organization, which reviewed maternity legislation for 167 countries. 
Again, the report confirms our outlier status. But the analysis also shows that not all women in countries where paid maternity leave is the standard are guaranteed full payment for the recommended length of time off, which is 14 weeks. 
For example, Japan requires 14 weeks of paid leave, but at a portion of regular pay and only if the employee is full-time and covered by health insurance, according to the ILO report. 
In other words, the ILO analysis shows that 59 percent of countries surveyed provided maternity leave that is ""unpaid, paid at less than two-thirds of previous earnings, or paid for a period of less than 14 weeks."" The United States is among those countries. 
We reached out to business representatives who might take issue with the statistic, but they couldn’t shed any light on how these policies really play out in other countries. Frack, the spokeswoman for Family Forward Oregon, said we asked good questions, but didn’t know either. 
Our ruling: 
The United States is rare in that the vast majority of countries surveyed have a government policy mandating paid maternity leave. The United States is really rare when compared to countries that are wealthy, developed. And again, we’re not going to quibble over the number of countries, because what we’re talking about is magnitude. 
We find the statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We’d caution readers to read the fine print. We rule the statement Mostly True.
