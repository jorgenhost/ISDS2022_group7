Photo of faith leaders praying over golden Trump statue is digitally altered
","Social media users are circulating an image that purportedly shows faith leaders surrounding and praying over a gold-painted statue of former President Donald Trump that appeared at the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference. ""Evangelicals literally praying to a golden idol. LITERALLY,"" one post said, alluding  to the golden calf idol in the Bible’s Old Testament. ""Caption this photo taken today of CPAC’s evangelical leaders. Yes, they are praying to a golden statue of their holy insurrectionist,"" another reads. But the image is altered, and the photo it’s based on wasn’t taken in 2021. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We conducted a reverse-image search, which showed that the original photo depicted Trump meeting with a group of evangelical leaders. In the doctored version, the gold-painted statue was edited in to replace Trump. The authentic photograph was taken by photographer Marco Bello at an ""Evangelicals for Trump"" launch event at the King Jesus International Ministry in Miami on Jan. 3, 2020.  News organizations such as the New York Times and NBC shared images and video of the moment.

No, Instagram isn't blocking your posts from all but 7% of your friends
","""This is a test,"" begins a message appearing in social media feeds. ""Instagram has been limiting our posts so that no more than 7% of our friends see our posts."" It goes on to explain that if you see the post, comment on it, and like it, the poster’s ranking will improve and more friends will be able to see it.  But this rumor is an old one, and it’s not true.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

After we published this fact-check, we heard from some readers who argued that we were wrong because Instagram limits the reach of posts that include false information.  When third-party fact-checkers, such as PolitiFact, identify misinformation, Instagram may make it harder to find by filtering it from its ""Explore"" and hashtag search pages, as well as reducing its visibility in feeds and stories, according to Facebook, which owns Instagram. But this is a different issue than the claim that Instagram is limiting people’s posts so that no more than 7% of their friends will see it.

Trump misleads about HR 1 and voter registration for welfare recipients
","Former President Donald Trump said that Democrats are racing to pass a bill that would destroy the integrity of elections and automatically register poor people to vote. In a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Trump reeled off multiple objections to H.R. 1, including that it ""automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote."" Trump’s statement is misleading. The Democrats’ bill to expand voting rights would require multiple government agencies to help eligible people register to vote when they apply for assistance, but it doesn’t single out applicants for programs associated with welfare. And Trump omits that public assistance agencies already play a role in helping people register to vote. H.R. 1 would expand that effort.  Known as the For the People Act, the 791-page H.R. 1 combines proposals for voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics.  We contacted a spokesperson for Trump to ask which section of H.R. 1 he was referring to and did not get a response. We also don’t know how Trump is defining ""welfare"" — an imprecise term that could refer to any number of public assistance programs.  We found no line in the legislation that calls for registering all ""welfare recipients"" to vote. But Trump was likely referring to the automatic voter registration section that applies to many people who seek government services. ""The goal of H.R. 1 is the full registration of eligible Americans,"" said Matthew Weil, an elections expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The 1993 National Voter Registration Act (often called ""Motor Voter"") requires most states to offer voter registration at their motor-vehicle departments. States must also offer voter registration at offices that provide public assistance or services to people with disabilities and military recruitment offices.  What is counted as public assistance? It’s a long list of federal programs including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps); the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children; Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; Medicaid; and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. If states have their own public assistance programs, those are included, too. ""Given the language found in NVRA, it's safe to say that a number of state public service agencies are already involved with helping people register to vote,"" Anthony Marcum, a resident fellow at the R Street Institute, a right-of-center organization that opposes H.R. 1 due to concerns about free speech and state rights. ""Just not as broadly — or automatically — as H.R. 1 envisions."" Under the 1993 law, public assistance applicants essentially ""opt in"" by choosing to register to vote. Under H.R. 1, applicants for services would have to ""opt out"" if they don’t want to register. H.R. 1 doesn’t automatically register everybody to vote who applies for public assistance, said Sarah Brannon, a voting rights attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. If state or federal agencies determined that they had enough information about an applicant to register to vote, they would forward that information electronically to an election official. If the agency lacks certain necessary information, such as citizenship verification, then the applicant would be directed to a voter registration form. Either way, it’s up to the elections official to determine whether the applicant is eligible to register to vote. ""It is just an automatic process to share the information so election officials decide who is or is not eligible,"" Brannon said.  The legislation also applies to applicants who previously sought public assistance. If a state agency has an applicant’s information needed to register to vote — including proof of citizenship, age and address — H.R. 1 would require the agency to forward that information to election officials.  H.R. 1 goes further than existing law by including more government offices that must participate including federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and state agencies responsible for regulating firearms — putting eligible registered firearm owners and veterans on the list of those who can choose to opt out of the voter registration process as well. If the legislation passes, would every ""welfare recipient"" be registered to vote as Trump said? That’s unlikely. Some public assistance applicants may opt out of voter registration because they are not interested. And applicants for public assistance still have to meet the eligibility criteria — including citizenship — to complete the registration process.  H.R. 1 ""automatically registers people for whom there is citizenship information,"" said Wendy Weiser, an expert on voting rights at the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at NYU school of law. ""Automatic voter registration does not substitute for eligibility checks; it substitutes the first part of the process: the application. Your application will be transmitted — you don’t have to take additional steps"" Experts told us that if H.R. 1 were to become law, they would expect some increase in the number of public assistance applicants who register to vote. But they said they couldn’t predict how many more will register that way. Here’s what we do know: Under current law, adults rarely fill out voter registration forms when they apply for public assistance. State motor-vehicle departments are the most common source of voter registrations, according to the Election Assistance Commission — and would likely remain so. Only about 2% of registrations came from public assistance offices, according to data about the 2016 and 2018 elections. Automatic voter registration is not a new idea, nor one exclusively pushed by Democrats. The Campaign Legal Center, a group that supports H.R. 1, found that automatic registration has been implemented in more than a dozen states, including Republican-led and battleground states. In these states, the DMV is the most common agency involved in automatic voter registration, though a few states use health or social service agencies, too. Trump said H.R. 1 ""automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote.""  H.R. 1 includes an automatic voter registration provision under which government agencies that provide public assistance would pass along to election officials information about people who are eligible to vote as well as any other relevant information including citizenship status. But Trump’s statement creates a misleading impression that people on welfare will have a special path to voter registration, regardless of eligibility. Under the bill, applicants could opt out, and election officials will still review applications for eligibility requirements before moving them to the voter rolls. That part of the bill isn’t exclusively for people on public assistance. It would apply to veterans and gun owners, too. We rate this statement Mostly False.

Fact-checking claims that Al Gore said all Arctic ice will be gone in the summer by 2013
","Former Vice President Al Gore has been a vocal advocate for policies to reduce global warming, dedicating much of his post-White House work to the cause — and encountering a fair amount of ridicule along the way. Now some social media users are sharing posts that claim Gore wrongly predicted in the late 2000s that all the Arctic ice would be melted in the summer by 2013.  ""The North Pole will be ice-free in the summer by 2013 because of man-made global warming. Al Gore, 2009,"" one Facebook post says. A photo below the quote shows a man covered in ice, with more in the background, and text that says, ""2021 nope it’s still cold!""  Gore didn’t say exactly this in 2009, but he made a similar statement. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In a Dec. 14, 2009, speech at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Gore suggested the possibility of the Arctic losing some or all of its ice in the summer months within five to seven years, citing researchers associated with the Naval Postgraduate School. ""Some of the models suggest to Dr. (Wieslav) Maslowski that there is a 75% chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during some of the summer months, could be completely ice-free within the next five to seven years."" Gore attributed the prediction to researchers, but it appears he misstated the findings.   A day after the speech, Maslowski told the London Times that it was unclear ""how this figure was arrived at … I would never try to estimate likelihood at anything as exact as this."" The article said that Gore’s office ""later admitted that the 75% figure was one used by Dr. Maslowski as a ‘ballpark figure’ several years ago in a conversation with Mr. Gore."" Gore made similar statements about Arctic ice in his 2007 Nobel prize acceptance speech and, in 2008, a video of the opening of a German museum captured Gore saying that ""the entire North polar ice cap may well be completely gone in five years.""  In his Academy Award-winning 2006 documentary  ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" Gore warned about the coming impact of climate change on the Arctic ice cap, but he said studies showed it would be gone in the summertime ""within the next 50 to 70 years"" — so by 2056 or 2076. Posts claim Al Gore said in 2009 that the North Pole ""will be ice-free in the summer by 2013 because of man-made global warming."" Gore said something similar. Citing researchers during a 2009 climate change conference, Gore  said there was a 75% chance that ice in the Arctic could be gone during at least some summer months within five to seven years. Reports indicate that he misrepresented the details of the research.  The post is accurate but needs additional information.

GOP treats Trump-era projects in pandemic bill as Democratic pork
","Republican opposition to the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief and economic stimulus package centers mainly on the argument that it contains wasteful spending. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., picked out two examples during a CBS News interview. ""Less than 1% of this bill is about the vaccine,"" Scott said March 1. ""It's about a bridge for Chuck Schumer, a tunnel for Nancy Pelosi. This is about paying back liberal politicians. It's not about getting our country back to normal again."" The 1% figure for vaccines is about right. The $20 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act for vaccines and their distribution might sound like a lot, but set against more than $1 trillion for unemployment and stimulus checks to individuals and aid to state and local governments, it looks small. Scott goes a bit further and uses infrastructure money in the bill to paint most of the package as misdirected political pork. He is repeating a Republican talking point. The legislation does include money for the examples he picked. First, the bridge: The bill would give $1.5 million to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corp. ""to prevent, prepare for and respond to coronavirus by conducting the operations, maintenance and capital infrastructure activities of the Seaway International Bridge,"" which connects New York state and Ontario. New York is Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s home state. And it would be easy to suggest his fingerprints are on this part of the bill, except for one key detail. The Trump administration first proposed spending this money. In May 2020, the Transportation Department asked for funds to make up for toll revenues that had ""dramatically decreased"" due to decreased traffic from the pandemic, the New York Daily News reported. The Canadians had put in their share of emergency relief, and the U.S. was going to do its part. The U.S. side of it sits in the district of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a key defender of former President Donald Trump during his first impeachment. As for the tunnel, while the bill doesn’t name a project in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s California district, it does have $1.425 billion for federal capital-investment grants to mass transit. Some of that is destined for a 6-mile extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which connects San Francisco, Oakland and surrounding suburbs.  But like the bridge money, this project also dates back to the Trump administration. In August 2019, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced $125 million for the extension.  Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said the current bill funds the larger mass transit program, and this project is among those that already won approval. He also noted that while the transit system serves the entire region, this work takes place 50 miles from Pelosi’s district. Scott spokesman McKinley Lewis noted that Democrats chose to include these elements in the bill, and the origins of them don’t matter. In any case, set against the bill’s total price tag, these elements amount to a fraction of a fraction of 1% of the total bill. For context, by the House Republicans’ calculations, nearly 50% of the bill goes toward what they consider legitimate COVID-19 and economic relief.  Past pandemic relief bills have included both health and economic stimulus elements. Most Republicans voted for those. Scott’s record is mixed. He voted for the March CARES Act and against the December supplemental aid package. Scott said the $1.9 trillion relief package is ""about a bridge for Chuck Schumer, a tunnel for Nancy Pelosi."" The bill has money both for a bridge between New York and Ontario, and for a mass transit project in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is difficult to tie them solely to Schumer and Pelosi because the Trump administration backed both efforts well before the current bill took shape.  Scott cherry-picked and mischaracterized a couple of examples of the bill’s overall spending. Even Republicans say about 50% goes toward helping households and businesses deal with the pandemic’s damage. We rate Scott’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B9E40>],/factchecks/2021/mar/02/rick-scott/gop-treats-trump-era-projects-pandemic-bill-democr/

Contrary to Pete Snyder, COVID studies don't say opening school is 'perfectly safe'
","Republican Pete Snyder is focusing his gubernatorial campaign on building a movement to reopen Virginia schools that have been closed during the coronavirus pandemic. ""All of the science and data say it’s perfectly safe to have teachers and students in the classroom,"" Snyder, a Charlottesville entrepreneur, said during a Feb. 22 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond. We fact-checked Snyder’s claim, which he also makes on his website, and found it to be wrong. All major studies do not say it’s ""perfectly safe"" to open schools. Most say that if K-12 schools adhere to mitigation measures — masking, physical distancing and frequent hand-washing — then there appears to be minimal risk of COVID-19 transmission from schools. Calls to reopen schools have become increasingly urgent in Virginia. The General Assembly on Feb. 25 passed a bill that would require school districts to offer students full time, in-person instruction by July 1. If a school has a high level of COVID-19 infection, then local officials can temporarily return to distance learning or a hybrid plan in which a school is partially open. The bill is being reviewed by Gov. Ralph Northam. According to March 1 data from the state Department of Education, 26 Virginia school districts were offering at least four days of weekly in-person teaching, 91 were operating under various hybrid plans of in-person and remote instruction, and 15 had fully remote teaching. Northam, a Democrat who has been criticized by the GOP as having an overly restrictive approach to COVID-19, has directed all school districts to offer in-person learning options by March 15.  President Joe Biden has set a national goal of getting most K-8 schools ""safely open"" by the end of April. A Feb. 1 survey of 13,597 U.S. school districts by MCH Strategic Data, a research and marketing corporation, found 18% were fully open for in-person instruction, 51% were in a hybrid plan and 23% were offering only online learning. During a Feb. 3 White House press briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said  ""there is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen.""  The CDC on Feb. 11 released guidance on how schools should approach reopening and repeatedly said there are varying degrees of risk that local education officials have to assess, and steps they can take to lower - but not remove - those risks.  ""While fewer children than adults have had COVID-19 in the United States, the number of school-aged children with COVID-19 has been increasing,"" the CDC said. ""...Resuming and maintaining in-person learning may pose risks to children, teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school environment, and their families and household members."" In addition to standard risk-mitigation steps, the CDC recommends inspections and possible improvements to ventilation systems, COVID testing for students and teachers who don’t feel well, contact tracing, dividing classrooms into student learning pods and monitoring community transmission of the virus. Several studies in late 2020 say opening schools may pose little or no added risk to students and teachers if mitigation standards are strongly enforced. Some of the research was cited by Republican state Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant - an Henrico County OB-GYN and sponsor of the bill to open Virginia schools - during floor debate. Let’s take a look: Only seven COVID-19 cases out of 191 were traced to in-school spread in 17 rural K-12 Wisconsin schools that had high mask-wearing compliance and were monitored over the 2020 fall semester. ""These findings suggest that attending school where recommended mitigation strategies are implemented might not place children in a higher risk environment than exists in the community,"" the report said. Mississippi researchers found most COVID-19 cases in children and teenagers were associated with gatherings outside of households and a lack of consistent mask use in schools, but not associated with merely attending school or child care. Thirty-two cases were associated with attending school out of more than 90,000 students and staff members in 11 North Carolina school districts, where students were required to wear masks, practice physical distancing and wash hands frequently. As PolitiFact has previously noted, there are some limitations to these studies, which often rely on contact tracing, a process that can’t always pinpoint where cases originate. Some of the studies also rely on self-reporting of mask-wearing by individuals, which could be inaccurate. We should note that communities are being urged to open schools with mitigation policies by American Academy of Pediatrics, which says staying home can hurt childrens’ mental health and learning. ""The AAP continues to strongly advocate that all policy considerations for school COVID-19 plans should start with a goal of having students physically present in school,"" the organization says in its guidance plan. Snyder, on his website, says ""the CDC and President Biden’s own Coronavirus Task Force both say it’s perfectly safe for schools to be open."" We asked his campaign to back up the claim and were sent a Jan. 21 article in healthline.com that said, ""Experts say that while there is uncertainty about how children in a classroom environment could impact the spread of disease, new data finds the actual risk to be low."" Our ruling  Snyder inaccurately says, ""All of the science and data say it’s perfectly safe to have teachers and students in the classroom."" A number of studies suggest there may be very little - if any - added risk of COVID spread if children and teachers return to schools. But the low risk depends on strictly enforcing mitigation strategies. We haven’t seen a single study that says opening schools is, in Snyder’s words, ""perfectly safe."" So, we rate Snyder’s statement False.  CORRECTION, March 3, 2021: An earlier version of this fact check incorrectly reported that Pete Snyder’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for information. This updated version includes the response, which does not change our rating.    ",[<zip object at 0x000002809732A540>],/factchecks/2021/mar/02/pete-snyder/contrary-pete-snyder-covid-studies-dont-say-openin/

Pelosi did not buy 'foreign oil stock' before executive order stopped Keystone XL construction
","More Facebook posts are claiming that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to profit from advance knowledge of policy changes under President Joe Biden. One such post says, ""Pelosi bought 1.5m in foreign oil stock day before shut down of American line."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence to back the claim. Pelosi’s most recent government disclosure form for stocks does not include any oil company stock purchases. No media outlet has reported on such a transaction, and her staff said the claim is false. The post’s reference to the ""shut down of American line"" likely means Biden’s Jan. 20 executive order that revoked construction permits for the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry crude oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast.  Biden’s opposition to the project was well-known long before his order, so the executive order was not a surprise. Biden was vice president in the Obama administration, which rejected a permit for the pipeline on environmental grounds. His campaign affirmed his opposition in May 2020, when he was the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. The claim says Pelosi bought the oil stock the day before the shutdown order, which would have been Jan. 19. Pelosi filed a Periodic Transaction Report dated Jan. 21 that disclosed her husband’s purchase of stock or stock options in four companies, none of which were oil companies. The reports are required when members of Congress — or their spouses or dependent children — make stock purchases worth more than $1,000.  The reports must be filed within 30 days of when the member became aware of the transaction, but no more than 45 days after the transaction. The Jan. 21 report was the only one Pelosi has filed in 2021. Any Jan. 19 transaction would have to be reported by March 5. Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff for Pelosi, said the claim is false, adding that the speaker does not own any stocks. We didn’t get a response to a request for further information. A financial disclosure report Pelosi filed in August 2020 lists substantial holdings of individual stocks by her husband.  The Jan. 21 transaction report was the subject of other claims that Pelosi traded in Tesla stock ahead of a Biden order calling for government purchases of electric vehicles.  PolitiFact rated the claim Mostly False. A Facebook post says, ""Pelosi bought 1.5m in foreign oil stock day before shut down of American line."" It appears to suggest that Pelosi sought to profit from knowing that a Jan. 20 executive order would shut down construction on the Keystone XL pipeline. Biden’s opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline was well-known for years, and his campaign said in May 2020 that he would halt it if elected.  Pelosi filed a government disclosure form on Jan. 21, 2021, indicating recent purchases of stocks and stock options by her husband, and none were oil companies. It is the only such disclosure she has filed in 2021. Media outlets have not reported any recent Pelosi family stock transactions involving oil companies, and her deputy chief of staff said the claim is false.

Fitzgerald overstates claim on pork in COVID-19 relief bill
","The American Rescue Plan — the signature initiative thus far in President Joe Biden’s tenure — has passed the U.S. House, sparking renewed debate over what exactly is in the $1.9 trillion package. Democrats are presenting the mammoth bill as a response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 500,000 lives and disrupted business, schooling and personal lives on every conceivable level. Republicans say it’s a pork-stuffed wish list that’s being opportunistically rammed through a Democratic-controlled Congress. Many Wisconsin Republicans seized on one particular number in attacking the plan: U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald in a statement: ""More than 91% of the spending in this $1.9 trillion package is not used for pandemic relief."" U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher on Twitter: ""9% of the $1.9 trillion the ‘American Rescue Plan’ spends goes to actually fighting the Coronavirus."" U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman on Twitter: ""The public has been told that today’s #BidenBailoutBill is a #COVID19 relief bill. Only 9% goes toward COVID."" Former Gov. Scott Walker on Facebook: ""Stop the Pelosi Payoff as only 9% of the bill is for COVID health-related relief."" We’re going to focus on Fitzgerald, who makes the broadest claim in the group.      Is it true that the initiative billed as a COVID ""relief"" bill directs hardly any funding in that direction? The analysis here examines the House version of the plan, which still must pass the Senate before it could head to Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The Senate could make changes — notably it is expected to drop efforts to increase the minimum wage — which would bounce it back to the House. Fitzgerald’s office didn’t immediately respond to our request for evidence of his claim, but we have plenty of information from outside sources to examine it. To be sure, the American Rescue Plan includes many measures unrelated to COVID-19. PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a claim from conservative Stand for America that the bill contains unrelated projects. Examples cited in that fact check included a $1.5 million bridge connecting New York and Canada, a $100 million underground rail project in Silicon Valley, $480 million for Native American language preservation and maintenance and $50 million in environmental justice grants. The bill would also raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and change pension funding rules. All told, about 15% of the proposal goes to ""long-standing policy priorities that are not directly related to the current crisis,"" said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, non-profit organization formed to educate the public on federal budget issues.  On the flip side, the 9% figure is roughly in line with the amount of money going to direct COVID-19 intervention.  In a fact check confirming about 1% is allotted to vaccinations, PolitiFact National found between $100 billion and $160 billion goes to direct intervention, depending on whether one includes items like $10 billion in medical supplies and $24 billion in child care for essential workers, as the White House does in arriving at the larger figure. That’s 4.5% to 8.5% of the total $1.9 trillion total. But a long list of other initiatives are clearly related to the pandemic, according to a breakdown by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. About 22% of the total bill comes from the $422 billion set aside for $1,400-per-person stimulus checks. Another 13% ($246 billion) is for extending additional unemployment funding of $400 per week. A combined 12% is going to the following:  Subsidized COBRA for laid-off workers Affordable Care Act subsidies for the next two years Expanded nutrition assistance to replace school lunch programs during the pandemic Funding for testing and contact tracing Disaster Relief Fund increases and covering COVID-related funeral expenses Grants to airlines and contractors to freeze layoffs through September Defense Production Act funding for medical supplies Grants for restaurants and bars that have lost revenue in the pandemic Economic Injury Disaster Loan Advance grants of up to $10,000 per business. It’s hard to describe anything on that list as unrelated to the pandemic and its economic fallout. Another $519 billion — 27% of the total — is going to state and local governments and schools, much of which will make up losses related to the pandemic and spur school re-opening. Republicans note much of the school funding, however, won’t be spent immediately. Fitzgerald said, ""More than 91% of the spending in this $1.9 trillion package is not used for pandemic relief."" Somewhere around 9% of the American Rescue Plan is going to direct disease containment measures such as vaccines, testing and tracing, and other public health initiatives. There’s room for debate over exactly how much of the $1.9 trillion is related to the pandemic. Surely not all of it. But it’s clear the amount going toward pandemic relief is far above 9%. One nonpartisan group identified 85% of the spending as being related to the current crisis. A closer look at the individual spending categories confirms, at minimum, that a majority of the spending goes to address the health and economic fallout of the pandemic. PolitiFact North Carolina rated Half True a claim from U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., that only 9% of the bill was going to COVID, and 91% wasn’t COVID-related. Budd got some credit for referencing 9% in a way consistent with the portion used for direct funding, and there’s a case ""COVID-related"" could reference only direct spending. But Fitzgerald is farther off in flatly asserting 91% didn’t go toward pandemic relief. That’s a broad claim that badly misstates the figure he’s trying to reference, that 91% didn’t go toward direct COVID-19 intervention.

No, there weren’t more votes than registered voters in the 2020 election
","An image widely shared on Facebook suggested that 26 million votes were fraudulently cast in the 2020 presidential election. It’s wrong.  It grossly understates the number of registered voters. The image depicts a classroom in which a white student asks a question and a Black teacher responds: ""America has 133 million registered voters. How could 159 million votes be cast?"" ""That’s not important. What’s important is that you’re a racist."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The number of registered voters is difficult to pinpoint — each state manages its own voter rolls, and with different rules; and the numbers change as voters register, move to another state or die. Some states allow voters to register on Election Day. But experts put the figure for the 2020 election at well above 200 million, or far more than the 159 million ballots that were cast. David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told PolitiFact there were nearly 215 million registered voters in 2020. World Population Review estimated 213.8 million. That was based on counts done in each state, and those counts were done at different times during the year, ranging from March 1, 2020, to Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the election.  Estimates made by experts quoted by the Associated Press ranged from 195 million to 215 million. According to the United States Election Project, which is run by University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald, 159,690,457 ballots were counted in the November election, including 158,254,475 that contained votes for president. The project is ""the gold standard of turnout statistics,"" said Charles Stewart, founding director of the MIT Election Data Science Lab.  Another sign that the 133 million figure for registered voters is way off: In the 2016 election, according to the Florida project, 138,846,571 ballots were cast, including 136,753,936 for president.

In CPAC return, Trump falsely claims Biden halted ‘all deportations’
","Former President Donald Trump criticized President Joe Biden for reversing Trump-era immigration policies and claimed that Biden had crippled the federal agency responsible for deportations. ""He has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations, everyone, murderers, everybody, no more,"" Trump said Feb. 28 at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. ""Let's not deport people, and restricting our law enforcement professionals."" Biden revoked several of his predecessor’s executive orders on immigration, ordered a review of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation priorities and a 100-day pause on deportations. But the Biden administration has not shut down ICE, as Trump claimed, and criminals, such as murderers, can still be deported. PolitiFact rated a similar claim at CPAC by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., as False. Trump’s office did not respond to our request for information. On Biden’s first day in office, David Pekoske, then the acting secretary of Homeland Security, said that the department did not have the resources to deport every single person living in the country illegally. An estimated 10.5 million people are in the U.S. unlawfully. Pekoske ordered a review of immigration enforcement practices. In the interim, he said the department would prioritize the deportation of people who threatened national security, border security and public safety. (Under the Trump administration, everyone in the country illegally was a deportation priority.) Pekoske also ordered an immediate 100-day pause on the deportation of people with final orders of removal. However, certain groups of people, including those who had engaged in or were suspected of terrorism or espionage, were not eligible for that temporary reprieve. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration over the deportation pause, and a federal judge has since blocked it indefinitely. ICE’s Acting Director Tae D. Johnson on Feb. 18 issued interim guidance reiterating that deportation resources would focus on presumed threats to national security, border security, and public safety.  ""Individuals are presumed to be a threat to public safety if, for example, they have been convicted of an aggravated felony or engaged in certain activity as part of a criminal gang or transnational criminal organization and there is reason to believe they currently pose a threat,"" ICE said. An aggravated felony includes murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor. ICE also said that while there were specific deportation priorities, immigration officers and agents were not prohibited from arresting, detaining or removing people not on the priority list. Those actions, though, would be ""subject to advance review,"" the guidance said. There have been news reports of deportations happening under Biden’s administration, although the specifics of those cases and exact number of people deported is unclear. PolitiFact asked ICE for details but the agency did not provide that information. It’s also worth noting that beyond ICE’s immigration enforcement unit, the agency also has a Homeland Security Investigations division. That division focuses on cases related to human smuggling and trafficking, money laundering, transnational gang activity, and other crimes. Biden has not ordered a ""shutdown"" of that unit, either. Trump said Biden ""has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations, everyone, murderers, everybody, no more."" Biden has not closed down ICE; the agency’s divisions are still operating. Biden’s administration established new deportation priorities and ordered a temporary pause on certain, not all, deportations. People convicted of serious crimes such as murder and who threatened public safety are a deportation priority under Biden’s administration. We rate Trump’s claim False.

Yes, the ACLU has criticized HR 1. Here’s why
","A major Democratic bill that aims to expand voting rights and overhaul campaign finance rules has resulted in some unusual allies. ""There’s a reason even the ACLU opposes #HR1 – it threatens our freedom of speech,"" tweeted Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel. There’s a reason even the ACLU opposes #HR1 – it threatens our freedom of speech. Known as the For the People Act, the 791-page H.R. 1 combines proposals for absentee voting, in-person voting, and campaign finance and ethics. The ACLU supports the bill’s provisions to expand voting rights and while it has criticisms of the legislation, its senior counsel told PolitiFact that it has not formally opposed the 2021 version, saying ""a serious legislative effort to restore and strengthen our republic is needed now more than ever.""  But McDaniel is right in that the organization says certain campaign finance provisions would limit free speech — and the ACLU has formally opposed the bill in the past. With the House poised to vote on H.R. 1, we asked for evidence behind McDaniel’s claim. A spokesperson for the RNC pointed to the ACLU’s own writings — letters to lawmakers and statements issued in 2019 and 2021 detailing their criticisms of H.R. 1. The ACLU is officially nonpartisan, but its advocacy for immigrants, the LGBTQ community, women and prisoners is often aligned with policies supported by the left. At the same time, the ACLU’s advocacy for free speech can sometimes put it on the same side as groups or individuals on the right. The ACLU has long opposed certain campaign finance proposals.  In 2019, the ACLU told lawmakers it ""opposes H.R.1"" and asked lawmakers to amend the bill to ""avoid unconstitutionally burdening political speech."" The ACLU said it supported goals in the bill to make it easier to vote, including restoring voting rights for felons, stopping the purge of inactive voters, increasing online voter registration and providing for no excuse absentee voting.  That initial bill passed the House but never reached a vote in the Senate. When Democrats introduced a new version in January, the ACLU told lawmakers that it had ""significant constitutional concerns."" ""We have not officially opposed the bill in the 117th Congress,"" Kathleen Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the ACLU, told PolitiFact. ""Following the Trump administration’s relentless attacks on our democratic system of government, a serious legislative effort to restore and strengthen our republic is needed now more than ever, and we strongly support many of the voting rights provisions in H.R. 1."" But the ACLU said requirements for organizations to disclose certain donors are ""onerous and dangerous."" The ACLU’s 2021 letter largely highlights its objections to the Shield Act and the Disclose Act, two Democratic bills rolled into H.R. 1.  While the ACLU said it agrees with the Shield Act’s goal to limit interference of foreign adversaries in elections, the act goes too far.  The group objected to a provision that makes campaign finance law violations deportable offenses. It also argued in 2019 that the Shield Act would prohibit foreign governments or foreign parties from creating paid ads.  ""If the governments of Germany, Canada, and France wanted to take out a nationwide advertisement during the Super Bowl in 2020 explaining why it is so important for the United States to recommit to the Paris Climate Agreement, the Shield Act would forbid that speech,"" the ACLU wrote. The Disclose Act requires additional disclosures related to political spending, including further restrictions on foreign money in elections. It demands that organizations that make campaign-related disbursements of more than $10,000 in an election reporting cycle disclose the names of donors who give $10,000 or more. The legislation makes it harder for ""dark money"" groups to avoid disclosures. Super PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts, as long as they don't directly coordinate with candidates or party committees. Super PACs publicly disclose their receipts and expenditures, though they sometimes get big donations from nonprofits, which don't have to disclose their donors. The ACLU said it supports mandated reporting of spending for public communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for office, but it said the Disclose Act goes beyond those bounds. The legislation ""could harm political advocacy and expose non-profit donors to harassment and threats of violence should their support for organizations be subject to forced disclosure,"" the ACLU wrote. In 2019, the ACLU also said it objected to at least sections of other legislation incorporated into H.R. 1, calling some of the language too vague or invasive of donor privacy. McDaniel’s tweet maintains that H.R. 1 ""threatens our freedom of speech"" — and she posits that she is in agreement with the ACLU on this point. The liberal Brennan Center for Justice at NYU disagrees with the ACLU’s conclusions that the bill will interfere with free speech, said Daniel Weiner, the center’s deputy director of election reform. Weiner said the goal isn’t to target everyday Americans making small donations, but rather big corporations and powerful interest groups.  ""It’s misleading to characterize transparency measures as a significant restriction on freedom of speech,"" he said. ""The notion that these (powerful) groups will be shrinking violets who might get criticized from spending and it might drive them from the public square is a bit much to take."" In a letter to lawmakers in support of H.R. 1, a few former ACLU officials joined with several constitutional scholars in calling the legislation the ""most significant pro-democracy legislation since the Voting Rights Act of 1965."" ""We do not view First Amendment concerns over the precise scope of disclosure requirements affecting large donors to tax-exempt organizations operating on the margins of electoral politics as outweighing the need for expeditious enactment of the clearly desirable aspects of H.R. 1 into law,"" they wrote. The Institute for Free Speech, a conservative group that advocates against campaign finance restrictions, sides with the ACLU in arguing that it would chill free speech. ""These advocates of restricting free speech want to have it both ways, by arguing that restricting speech is necessary or beneficial, but also that what they propose does not restrict speech,"" said Bradley A. Smith, chairman of the institute and a professor at Capital University Law School, in an email to PolitiFact. McDaniel tweeted that the ""ACLU opposes HR 1"" on grounds that ""it threatens our freedom of speech."" The ACLU opposed the 2019 version of H.R. 1, saying multiple provisions would limit free speech. When Democrats unveiled the bill again in January, ACLU said it still held many of their earlier concerns and called some sections ""onerous and dangerous."" But the ACLU has stopped short of opposing the bill in 2021.  While it is clear that freedom of speech for political donors is among the ACLU’s concerns, the ACLU has not opposed the bill in 2021. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

Here’s why.  Facebook’s tally of registered voters, which users will sometimes see pinned to the top of their newsfeeds, displays the number of people in the U.S. who’ve used Facebook’s interface to share that they have registered to vote. The figure is not representative only of those in Arizona — or any other single state, for that matter. As part of the social media network’s 2020 voting initiative, which the company launched this summer, users 18 and older will see a pinned box at the top of their news feeds that contains information about voter registration. The website’s voting information center also provides details on how to check your registration status and information on where to register, including a link to the user’s state registration website or a voting information organization.  A spokesperson for Facebook confirmed to PolitiFact that it hasn't shared the number of registered voters by region or state, and said the post is likely referring to the total number of users around the U.S. who’ve shared that they registered, which updates in real time. A tally showing that figure appears above the words ""People who shared they registered to vote in the United States."" The user’s state is listed above that tally, but the number isn’t specific to that state: As of July 2019, the population of Arizona stood just over 7.2 million, with 22.5%, or about 1.6 million, being under the age of 18 and therefore not eligible to vote, according to Census data.

No, Wisconsin votes don’t have to be counted by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3
","As President Donald Trump continues to demand an early call of a winner on election night, a new Facebook post making the rounds suggests he got his wish -- at least in Wisconsin. The Sept. 28, 2020, Facebook post reads: ""A federal judge just ordered Wisconsin must have all ballots counted by 8 p.m. on the day of the election."" In the comments on the post, many offer thanks for sharing the information. Some call for the same order to be given for other states. One problem: The post is completely fictitious. In fact, a ruling from a federal judge -- upheld by an appeals panel -- actually does the opposite. It extends the period for which absentee ballots can be counted by nearly a week. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Let's look at this more closely. The first problem is that results have never been tallied by 8 p.m. on Election Day. That’s when polls close. And, by state law, anyone in line by 8 p.m. is entitled to vote. That alone might take hours in a high turnout election. So, as a practical matter, there is no way to count all of the votes by 8 p.m.  Even in pre-pandemic election years, when many fewer absentee ballots are involved, it can take hours to run all of the ballots through machines and get final numbers. That’s because Wisconsin is among a few states that do not allow election clerks to begin that process until Election Day. Clerks -- Republican and Democrat alike -- have long asked for the Legislature to change this. Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson recently called for it as well, but the GOP-controlled Legislature has refused to act. The Facebook post says a judge issued this ruling but provides no name. That’s because there is no such ruling. Historically, state law has held that only absentee ballots received by Election Day can be tabulated. Those that come in later, even if mailed on time, are discarded. On Sept. 21, 2020, a federal judge ordered a number of changes to procedures. Notably, for our purposes here, he gave Wisconsin voters more time to get their absentee ballots in. As long as the ballots are postmarked by Nov. 3, they can be accepted and counted by clerks through Nov. 9, nearly one week later. That judge, William Conley, initially put that ruling on hold, so it could be appealed. On Sept 29, a panel of appeals court judges upheld the ruling, putting the extended deadline in place. That ruling, which was unanimous, came from a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents. The decision was a victory for Democrats, who asked to loosen election rules during the coronavirus pandemic and a setback for Republicans who tried to prevent changes to the timeline of Election Day.  The ruling, which could be appealed again, also gave voters extra time to register to vote, extending the deadline from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.  The Facebook post claims that a judge ruled all ballots in Wisconsin must be counted by 8 p.m. on Election Day. But the post gets it completely wrong. First, voters in line at 8 p.m. on Election Day can legally cast their vote. No judge made this ruling.  An earlier ruling from a federal judge -- since upheld by an appeals panel -- actually did the opposite, allowing any absentee ballots returned by Nov. 9 to be counted, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C5FC0>],/factchecks/2020/sep/30/facebook-posts/no-votes-dont-have-be-counted-8-pm-nov-3/

Experts say Trump tax report shows aggressive tax avoidance, unusually persistent losses
","A recent New York Times report that President Donald Trump has incurred staggering business losses and paid little to no federal income taxes in many years drew a challenge from some of the president’s allies in the media, who said the pattern is typical for wealthy people. Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, and no taxes at all in 10 of the 15 years before that, according to the Times, which obtained nearly two decades’ worth of tax-return data for Trump and his businesses. The report also detailed huge losses incurred by the business empire Trump has cited as proof of his acumen. Those losses, along with other tax write-offs and maneuvers — such as a $72.9 million tax refund that’s being scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service and a congressional tax committee — have enabled the president to avoid paying much in federal income taxes while sustaining his lavish lifestyle. In a Sept. 27 briefing at the White House, Trump dismissed the report. The next morning, one of his media defenders suggested that the report is much ado about nothing. ""I had an accountant look at it last night,"" radio host Hugh Hewitt said on his show. ""It's what any wealthy person's tax history is, if you can believe it — which is good years and bad years, years of immense taxes and years of almost no taxes at all because you carry over losses."" How does Trump’s tax history compare with other wealthy people? We asked eight tax experts if the low tax bills and aggressive tax avoidance documented by the Times are typical of the rich. Without access to the tax returns for Trump and others, they said, it’s hard to draw comparisons. Everyone pays taxes according to their own unique circumstances, and wealthy people can use a variety of legal maneuvers to reduce their tax bills. But the experts generally agreed that at least two aspects of Trump’s tax history as described in the Times report stand out compared with other wealthy people who may also try to legally reduce their tax bills: the severity of his losses and the extent of his tax avoidance. ""The Trump tax returns appear highly unusual compared to typical wealthy taxpayers,"" said Kimberly Clausing, a professor of economics at Reed College. ""His losses are more persistent, his tax avoidance is more aggressive, and there are signs of tax evasion. The audit itself is a big red flag, and many of the described deductions sound borderline at best."" ""I can't think of anyone who was as aggressive as Trump over such a sustained period,"" added Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. He called Hewitt’s claim ""ridiculous.""  Hewitt did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has filed the annual financial disclosure forms required of executive branch employees, listing his income sources and assets. But citing a pending audit, he has refused to release his tax returns, breaking from a longstanding precedent for U.S. presidents.  The New York Times report provided the most in-depth look yet at Trump’s finances.  A lawyer for the Trump Organization, the umbrella company for the Trump family’s business interests, told the Times most of the report’s facts appeared to be inaccurate. The lawyer said Trump had paid millions of dollars in federal taxes, but didn’t provide details or documentation. The Times reported that Trump paid little to no federal income taxes in many years, largely because his businesses — including major properties like his Doral, Fla., resort — have often reported losses that he has used to wipe out income tax liabilities for his earnings from ""The Apprentice"" TV show, branding deals and investments. ""Trump is using large tax losses from some businesses to offset his active income from wages or other businesses,"" said Edward McCaffery, a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California. The Times reported that the nearly $1 billion in losses Trump experienced in the early 1990s generated tax deductions he was able to use through 2005. After new income from ""The Apprentice"" brought his tax bills back into the millions, he went on a buying spree, purchasing new golf courses and other properties that have since incurred similar losses. Wealthy businesspeople do at times experience volatility with their incomes, or bad years followed by good ones, experts said. Real estate investors often benefit from generous tax rules covering the deduction of depreciation expenses, as well, according to the Associated Press.  But that doesn’t mean Trump’s pattern of big business losses and low income taxes resemble ""any wealthy person's tax history,"" as Hewitt claimed. ""It's wildly atypical to have lost so much, so consistently, from businesses that he personally operates,"" said Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University School of Law. ""Carryover losses and deductions for real estate are obviously legal,"" added Omri Marian, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. ""It is certainly surprising, however, for people who maintain themselves as billionaires to pay so little tax for so long."" In a separate report, the Times wrote that Trump’s tax avoidance ""sets him apart from most other affluent Americans,"" many of whom take advantage of loopholes in the tax code. The average federal income tax rate for the highest .001% of earners in 2017 was 24.1%, the IRS says. Over the past two decades, Trump ""has paid about $400 million less in combined federal income taxes than a very wealthy person who paid the average for that group each year,"" according to the Times. Other data show similar discrepancies. Georgetown Law’s Brian Galle, an expert in taxation, pointed to data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that shows the top 1% of households paying more than $400,000 in federal income tax on average in recent years. ""A typical billionaire, contrary to popular belief, pays tens of millions of dollars in taxes each year,"" said Joseph Bishop-Henchman, vice president of tax policy and litigation at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. ""A billionaire consistently paying at or near zero is not common."" The Times report also details many conflicts of interest created by Trump’s refusal to divest from his businesses as president, as well as the financial stress that looms as millions of dollars in loans Trump personally guaranteed come due. Trump is still fighting the IRS over the $72.9 million tax refund from 2010, which was triggered by major business losses and helped wipe out several years’ worth of tax liabilities. If the IRS decides the refund was illegitimate, he could owe the government over $100 million. The refund and other questionable tax deductions Trump has claimed are signs that Trump may have been more aggressive in avoiding taxes than other wealthy people, experts said, although they cautioned that more facts would be needed to show evidence of illegality. The Times reported, for example, that the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, while working as an employee of the Trump Organization, appeared to have received ""consulting fees"" that were later claimed as business expenses, which reduced the family’s tax bill. More information is needed to confirm whether Ivanka Trump was the recipient of those fees and whether there was wrongdoing, Georgetown Law’s Galle said. But such a move is unusual for a person who is involved in a company’s operations as an executive. ""It is common to hire consultants,"" Galle said. ""It is not common to hire your child as a consultant and pay her seven figures when she doesn't provide any actual services in exchange."" Other experts raised questions about different tax write-offs described by the Times, such as Trump’s classification of a New York estate as an investment property, rather than a personal residence, which allowed him to claim a charitable tax deduction. The classification also allowed Trump to claim millions of dollars in property taxes as a business expense. The Times said Trump has also classified personal spending as business expenses — for example, more than $70,000 he spent on hairstyling during ""The Apprentice."" Trump’s position on these expenses was ""more aggressive"" than many wealthy people, said Joseph Bankman, a professor of law and business at Stanford Law School.  Charitable deductions and deductions for business expenses are ""widely used without abuse,"" said Bishop-Henchman. They are governed by an increasing number of rules. But McCaffery, the expert at USC, said that while the deductions Trump has claimed are somewhat standard, they seem to have been ""taken to lavish extremes"" by the president: ""An actor can deduct hairstyling costs. But $70,000?"" Hewitt said Trump’s tax returns show ""what any wealthy person's tax history is, if you can believe it — which is good years and bad years, years of immense taxes and years of almost no taxes at all because you carry over losses."" Wealthy business people do sometimes experience a mix of good and bad years, with fluctuations in their tax liabilities, and they deploy similar strategies to reduce their tax bills. But a key difference is scale. Trump’s tax avoidance as documented by the Times is exceptionally aggressive, experts said, and the losses he has used to reduce his income taxes are bigger and more persistent than what’s typical.

By contrast, Trump said, under President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s 2020 opponent, ""They brought back nothing."" Trump is exaggerating gains on his own watch, even before the coronavirus pandemic, and he’s offering a misleading assessment of what happened during the Obama administration. We looked at manufacturing employment data from January 2009, when Obama took office, through August 2020, the most recent month available. Here’s what the data looks like, with Obama’s tenure in blue and Trump’s in red.   This shows that Trump is wrong to say that 700,000 manufacturing jobs were created on his watch. The actual rise prior to the coronavirus pandemic was about 450,000 manufacturing jobs. (If you do account for the recession prompted by the pandemic, which is not advisable since the economy is so volatile at the moment, manufacturing employment has declined by 237,000.) The situation under Obama is trickier to parse. During Obama’s entire tenure in the White House, manufacturing employment fell by 192,000. Keep in mind, though, that Obama inherited the Great Recession. A fair comparison between Trump and Biden excludes both recessions.  From the low point of the recession in 2010, the manufacturing sector added 916,000 jobs on Obama’s watch. That was roughly seven years, about twice the amount Trump’s been in office, so on an annual basis, the manufacturing employment gains per year were roughly similar between the two presidents. In fact, you can see in the chart that the pace of increase was fairly constant for Obama’s final seven years and Trump’s first three years. In awarding Trump a Promise Broken for his pledge to bring back manufacturing, we also noted that another metric, gross manufacturing output by quarter, found nothing special on Trump’s watch. Manufacturing output rose during the first year and a half of Trump's presidency, but at a rate not much faster than during most of Obama's presidency. And after that, output stagnated or even declined slightly. ""There was nothing special or extraordinary about Trump's two years of manufacturing job growth, other than to say he benefited from synchronized global growth, which is very rare, and juice from the corporate tax cut, which probably shifted investment and hiring forward a bit,"" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, told us in June. Finally, presidents can have an impact on economic conditions, but they are not the only factor. Among the things out of their control are external economic shocks such as oil price fluctuations, changes in technology, and the state of the global economy. Trump said that in the manufacturing sector, ""I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing."" Trump is wrong about the job gains on his watch; the actual increase is about 450,000 prior to the pandemic. As for the record under Obama and Biden, Trump wants to have his cake and eat it, too. If he’s going to ignore the coronavirus pandemic, then it’s fairest to ignore the Great Recession in comparing himself with Obama. And during the post-recession recovery, Obama oversaw gains of 916,000 manufacturing jobs.

Donald Trump falsely says 308,000 military people died waiting for care on Biden’s watch
","President Donald Trump parried an attack on his COVID-19 track record with an attack of his own on Democratic nominee Joe Biden. ""Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper health care in the military,"" Trump said Sept. 29 at the first presidential debate. ""So don’t tell me about this."" The claim stems from the 2014 debacle at several VA hospitals, where veterans were found to have died waiting to have their benefits approved to receive care. After news of the scandal broke, lawmakers asked the inspector general to investigate the scale of the VA application backlog and the deaths that resulted. Investigators found a data system in chaos. The problems included: In 2014, the VA’s database contained applications for people who died before 1998.  In the course of moving millions of records around in 2013, the VA inadvertently created enrollment entries for people ""who never sought care or applied for enrollment.""  The database included anyone who had any contact with the VA, including people ""whose military service has not been confirmed, qualified family members, employees participating in the employee health program, or patients receiving humanitarian care.""  To the point of Trump’s claim, the inspector general was able to match Social Security death records with over 307,000 applications listed as pending, but that included people who might never have applied or been eligible for care. In any event, 84% of the total died before 2010, the Obama-Biden administration’s second year. Investigators described the VA’s enrollment system as ""virtually unreliable."" We reached out to the Trump campaign. While they had directed Factcheck.org to the inspector general’s report, they did not respond to our query. Trump said that 308,000 military people died on Biden’s watch because he ""couldn’t provide them proper health care in the military."" Trump’s number is inaccurate.

In Florida congressional race, Carlos Gimenez’s salary, car come under attack
","An attack by U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell portrays Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez as living the high life at county hall at taxpayers’ expense. ""Corrupt Carlos Gimenez approved a 67% pay raise for himself and increased his own pension,"" states Mucarsel-Powell’s website. ""He makes $250,000 a year, more than almost every big-city Mayor in the country. He also kept his taxpayer-funded Mercedes-Benz after slashing $400 million in government jobs and spending."" Mucarsel-Powell, a first-term incumbent, faces a challenge from Gimenez, a Republican who has served as mayor of Florida’s most populous county since 2011. It’s one of 18 pivotal House and Senate races up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking, and the most competitive congressional contest in Florida. Evidence cited by Murcarsel-Powell’s campaign website — including news articles and county documents — show that Gimenez did raise his pay and accept a car perk, but these claims leave out significant context. The car allowance was from about a decade ago before he was mayor, and the pay raise followed years of a pay cut. RELATED: Fact-checking Fla. Rep. Mucarsel-Powell’s attack on Gimenez over bridge collapse Gimenez did call for his own pay raise, but Mucarsel-Powell omits that Gimenez also substantially slashed his own salary several years earlier, delivering on a campaign promise. Gimenez’s predecessor earned a base salary of about $230,000 plus additional compensation. When Gimenez took office as mayor in 2011, he cut the salary to $150,000. The Miami Herald reported that seven years after Gimenez took office as mayor, county commissioners authorized Gimenez’s proposal to raise his salary from $150,000 to $250,000, a 67% increase. In 2018, Gimenez defended taking the salary increase. ""I made a decision to reduce my salary and benefits by half when I was first elected mayor in 2011 during a tough economic time in which all employees had to face salary reductions,"" Gimenez said. ""Today, after forgoing my full salary for seven years, our county's economy is strong, and our efforts to tighten the belt have paid off."" The salary increase Gimenez secured meant that his pension would increase, too. It’s worth noting that if Gimenez wins the congressional race, his Washington salary will drop to the $174,000 paid to members of Congress. In short, yes.  County records showed Gimenez was paid about $251,000 in 2019. Mucarsel-Powell cited a 2018 Business Journals article about the salaries of 57 big city mayors. The article showed that two mayors earned in the ballpark of Gimenez’s salary — in Los Angeles, the mayor’s salary was about $248,000, while in New York City, it was about $259,000. The highest paid mayor at the time was San Francisco’s, with a salary of about $300,000. We were unable to find a comparison of county mayor salary data.  Comparing salaries among elected government officials is tricky due to varying forms of government in different jurisdictions. Miami-Dade County, with a population of about 2.8 million, is the seventh most populous county in the United States and has a strong mayor form of government. The elected mayor is the chief executive — the county doesn’t have a county manager or administrator.  Gimenez did drive a Mercedes-Benz at taxpayer expense, but it wasn’t as mayor. This happened when he was a county commissioner with a car allowance from 2004 to 2011. In his final year on the commission, his annual salary of $6,000 came with benefits that included a $9,600-a-year car allowance.  In 2009, the County Commission including Gimenez approved about $400 million in jobs and spending cuts amid the recession. Meanwhile, the county continued to pick up the tab for commissioners’ luxury cars, including the 2009 Mercedes Benz ML 350 SUV that Gimenez drove. Once he became mayor, Gimenez assumed the lease personally, according to Jennifer Moon, the county budget director. When the lease expired, he purchased the car for the residual value. As mayor for the last nine years, Gimenez has not had a car allowance. Mucarsel-Powell said Gimenez ""approved a 67% pay raise for himself and increased his own pension. He makes $250,000 a year, more than almost every big-city Mayor in the country. He also kept his taxpayer-funded Mercedes-Benz after slashing $400 million in government jobs and spending."" The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Gimenez did get a 67% pay raise in the fall of 2018, which will increase his pension. But the evidence shows he slashed the mayor’s salary when he took office in 2011.  Mucarsel-Powell’s campaign website points to a 2018 news article which shows that the $250,000 salary is higher than most big city mayors. In 2009, the County Commission along with Gimenez voted for the budget cuts while keeping their car perks. But when Gimenez became mayor, he took over the lease for his car and no longer had a car allowance.

Alleged shooter in triple homicide not a BLM activist or wearing Breonna Taylor shirt
","A former U.S. senatorial candidate said in a Sept. 21 Facebook post that a man accused of shooting and killing three people at a Louisville, Ky., bar is a Black Lives Matter activist who was wearing a Breonna Taylor T-shirt.  ""BLM Activist kills three people in a Louisville bar wearing a Breonna Taylor tee shirt last Friday. Why isn’t this National News?"" said Peggy Hubbard, who ran for U.S. Senate and lost Illinois’ Republican primary election in March. Hubbard’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Hubbard’s claim is based on a triple homicide that happened Sept. 18 on the patio of Bungalow Joe’s bar and restaurant in Louisville. Michael E. Rhynes Jr. was charged with three counts of murder and has pleaded not guilty. A photo shows and police confirmed that Rhynes was wearing a different shirt, not a Breonna Taylor shirt.  Taylor was a 25-year-old Black woman who was shot and killed by Louisville police in March as officers executed a search warrant at her home. Since her death, activists, athletes and celebrities have called attention to the case, and her name has become a rallying cry in nationwide calls for police reform.  But her name was not on the shirt Rhynes was wearing at the time of the bar shooting. In a still photo taken from a TikTok video showing his arrest shortly after the shooting, Rhynes’ shirt is visible. It features images of Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick and the hashtag #freedom, according to Snopes.com. The shirt Rhynes wore was custom made by a company Rhynes co-owns, according to Louisville police. Rhynes’ LinkedIn profile says he is the chief executive officer for Serve N Slay Images in Louisville, and the Kentucky Secretary of State lists him as the registered agent for the company.  Serve N Slay’s apparel line is ""geared towards showing a positive image and message for the black community with a bit of attitude and flavor,"" according to its website. The clothing offered for sale includes a Black Lives Matter t-shirt. There is no online evidence to indicate that Rhynes is an activist within the Black Lives Matter movement. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts for his business have been disabled or removed. Rhynes also does not appear to have any currently active personal social media accounts. Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Donny Burbrink, who leads the department’s homicide unit, said the shooting seemed to be ""a completely random act."" Police said they do not have any proof that the crime was racially motivated, WAVE 3 News in Louisville reported, and one of the men killed was a Black man.  Other social media posts similar to Hubbard’s falsely claimed that the bar where the triple shooting took place is owned by a retired police officer. The owner of Bungalow Joe’s, Joe Bishop, has debunked that rumor himself in media interviews. Bishop also told Fox News that his review of security footage revealed Rhynes was not wearing a Breonna Taylor shirt Hubbard said, ""BLM Activist kills three people in a Louisville bar wearing a Breonna Taylor tee shirt last Friday. Why isn’t this National News?"" Hubbard’s Facebook post contains an element of truth because a triple homicide did take place in Louisville and the alleged shooter owns a business that promotes positive messages for the Black community, including on clothing it sells. However, the post ignores critical facts: The shooter is not known to be an activist in the Black Lives Matter movement and was not wearing a shirt featuring Breonna Taylor.

He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.  Moving right to left, top to bottom, the man in the second photo is Corey Lee Henderson, who was shot and killed by police in Holladay, Utah, after police said Henderson shot and killed a police officer in January 2016.  The third photo shows Phillip Ferry, who was accused of fatally shooting an officer in Seaside, Oregon, in February 2016. Another officer shot and killed him. The fourth photo shows Austin Holzer, who was 17 when he was charged with first-degree murder in the fatal February 2016 shooting of a sheriff’s deputy in Mesa County, Colorado. He pleaded guilty.  The fifth photo shows David Brian Evans, who shot and killed two deputies in Harford County, Md., before he was killed by deputies who returned fire in February 2016. The sixth photo shows Marcus Schumacher, who authorities said shot and killed a police officer in Fargo, N.D., before he turned the gun on himself in February 2016. The seventh photo shows Charles Lee Lambert, who shot and killed a state trooper in Mississippi in February 2016 and was then killed by other officers.  The eighth photo shows Martin Wirth, who shot and killed an officer in Bailey, Colo., before officers shot and killed him in February 2016. The ninth photo shows Evan Dorsey, who police said shot and killed an Indiana sheriff’s deputy before killing himself in March 2016. The 10th photo shows Lincoln Rutledge, who was accused of killing an Ohio police officer who was part of a SWAT team trying to arrest Rutledge for allegedly setting fire to his estranged wife’s house in April 2016. He was sentenced to life in prison.  The 11th photo shows Joseph Moreno, who was accused of killing an officer in Alamogordo, N.M., in September 2016. Police shot and killed Moreno.  The 12th photo shows Trenton Forster, who was charged with murder in the October 2016 death of a St. Louis County officer in Missouri. He was sentenced to life in prison.  The 13th photo shows John Hernandez Felix, who was sentenced to death in the October 2016 killing of two police officers in Palm Springs, Calif. The 14th photo shows Ralph Stanley Elrod Jr., who was charged with murder in the deaths of two sheriff’s deputies in Peach County, Ga., in November 2016. He pleaded guilty and received two life sentences. The 15th photo shows Larry Darnell Gordon, who authorities said was trying to escape from a courthouse in Michigan when he took a gun from an officer and killed two bailiffs before he was fatally shot by other officers in July 2016.  The 16th photo shows Jesse Denver Hanes, who was accused of killing a police officer in New Mexico in August 2016. He was sentenced to life in prison. It’s unclear what the Facebook post meant when it asked about the grid: ""Anyone notice anything strange?"" Many of the people featured in the image who were accused of killing officers were themselves shot and killed at the scene by police. Lead Stories, which also looked into this claim, also noted that other officers were killed that year by suspects including men of different ethnicities. The post claims that the photos show ""all the men"" who killed police officers this year. It’s true that the people in the images were accused of killing law enforcement officers. But that was in 2016, not 2020. And more than 16 people were accused of killing police that year.

""Of course he’s not wearing an earpiece,"" Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told reporters Sept. 29.

Similar rumors have surfaced in nearly every presidential election since then. We debunked a nearly identical claim about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential debates.

The U.S. bought in excess of $300 billion more in goods and services from China in 2019 than China did from the U.S. Biden’s campaign pointed to a more limited figure — trade in goods only — which shows that the trade deficit with China has generally been higher under Trump than it was under Obama. But even here, the U.S. made progress under Trump in 2019 in whittling down the goods deficit. The goods deficit was $375 billion in 2017, $418 billion in 2018, and $345 billion in 2019. The 2019 figure was similar to the level it was in 2016, the final year of the Obama administration. Biden said, ""We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before.""

It’s an implant that goes into the skull above the ear and it has two micro-wire probes that are injected into the nerves inside the ear canal. It’s FDA-approved and it uses bone conduction to enhance hearing (sound waves vibrate off the bones of the skull, and the wire probes send the signal directly into the ear, basically). It’s wireless and it’s controlled by the push of a button, so the user can turn it on and off with a little device… that fits in your pocket. And that’s how the experts at Bombards Body Language spotted this trick. …  ""When Joe Biden gets confused, he reaches into his pocket and turns on the implant.

""The Esteem Hearing Implant is not capable of this type of wireless communication and cannot be used in the manner described. The implant is a completely internal hearing device that improves the hearing of adults diagnosed with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss."" Biden’s campaign also refuted Trump campaign claims that Biden won’t agree to an ear inspection and that Biden wanted multiple breaks during the 90-minute debate. ""Of course he’s not wearing an earpiece and we never asked for breaks,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager and communications director, told reporters Sept. 29. In December 2019, Biden’s primary care physician, at Biden’s request, issued a summary of his medical and surgical history. It did not mention any skull implant or hearing aid and said that his head, ears, eyes, nose and throat ""are normal.""

Dragoo jumps the gun; ranked-choice voting is still up for debate
","How do you get people to vote? With the 2020 election just around the corner, voter turnout is a hot topic. The Green Party platform calls for a voting system rework.  Kelley Dragoo, the Green Party candidate for Missouri’s lieutenant governor seat, said in a YouTube video that a different method of voting, called ranked choice, saves money and mitigates the problem of having to pick a ""lesser of two evils,"" among other benefits. Ranked-choice voting allows voters to rank candidates from most to least preferred on the ballot, meaning that people can vote for multiple candidates at the same time. If a clear winner is decided in the first tally, that’s the winner of the election. If there isn’t a clear winner, the votes are recounted with the least popular candidate eliminated. Votes that ranked the now eliminated candidate as their first preference then go toward those voters’ second preference instead. So on and so forth until a majority winner is decided. Ranked-choice voting, Dragoo said, ""is a really viable option and it's something that would better our voting process. It increases voter turnout and voter engagement, which is really what we need right now."" Is ranked-choice voting really the silver bullet to voter turnout and engagement?  Hard to say. We decided to do some digging. Ranked-choice voting is an umbrella term. Instant runoff voting, preferential voting and the alternative vote are all titles that refer to ranked-choice voting. Ranked-choice voting exists in municipal elections as well as Maine’s state elections. The method has existed in smaller elections since the 1940s, but most city and statewide adoptions of ranked-choice voting only date back to the 2000s. We asked Dragoo for a source on her claim. In an email, she cited Fairvote and RankedChoiceVoting.org. Both are organizations that advocate for ranked-choice voting, using research from universities and government agencies as well as their own studies. Fairvote cites a 2016 study by professor David Kimball at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The study found that ranked-choice voting was associated with a roughly 9 percentage point increase in voter turnout in municipal elections, but did not find that ranked-choice had a significant impact on voter turnout in general elections.  Fairvote’s research on the subject suggests that ranked-choice voting is associated with higher turnout. Fairvote clarifies that they did not attempt to control for factors that can also drive turnout, such as election competitiveness. Voter engagement is exactly what it sounds like: people’s likelihood to talk about or engage with the election both in and outside the political space. A study by Fairvote found that people were more likely to discuss local elections in cities that implemented ranked-choice voting. However, a study from San Francisco State University tracked San Francisco’s mayoral elections from 1995 to 2011 and found that instant runoff voting requires voters to know more about the candidates, increasing information costs and widening the gap in voter turnout between racial and age groups. Voter turnout and engagement both have a lot of moving parts. It’s hard to link just one element of an election process to an increase in either because so many things can influence an election. So, we spoke to an expert. James Endersby is a professor of political science at the University of Missouri who studies elections and is writing a book on ranked-choice voting. Endersby finds that when a new voting system is adopted, we tend to see a short-lived increase in voter turnout. ""And then people sort of say, ‘well, it’s politics as usual’ and it goes back down to the same levels again,"" he says. The novelty of a new system isn’t the only thing that confounds the data. In 2018, Maine introduced ranked-choice voting in its congressional elections and saw an increase in turnout. But there was also an overall higher turnout in 2018 across the country, so that can’t be attributed to just ranked-choice voting. Another factor worth considering is the competitiveness of elections. Fairvote finds that a competitive ranked-choice vote election can drive turnout. However, competitive elections see increases regardless of what system they are using. Lastly, Endersby finds that a lot of the numbers just aren’t in yet. ""There's not really good data, because we don't have good denominators. It all depends on how the cleaning of the registration records go, in terms of how many people vote,"" he says. It’s hard to draw a conclusion about the effect of ranked-choice voting on turnout and engagement nationwide when studies have city sample sizes. As it is now, there are too many factors that get in the way of accurate data on the subject. With time, we may see a noted increase, but it’s too early to call. Dragoo said ranked-choice voting ""increases voter turnout and voter engagement."" The evidence suggests only that it could or that it can in certain circumstances. The number of candidates, the competitiveness and scale of the election, and the new ways in which we vote all drive voter turnout and engagement in the short term. It’s hard to say whether ranked-choice voting definitively increases voter turnout and engagement on a large scale and in the long term because the data isn’t there yet. We rate Dragoo’s statement Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280979C6680>],/factchecks/2020/sep/29/kelley-dragoo/dragoo-jumps-gun-ranked-choice-voting-still-debate/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Missouri', 'Anthony Rogers']","
Cori Bush’s court cases aren’t criminal despite claims by opponent
","On Sept. 15, Anthony Rogers made a hefty claim on Facebook against his opponent, Democrat Cori Bush.  ""Cori Bush is a career criminal and a con artist. Think twice before you fall for the bulls---, St. Louis,"" said Rogers, the Republican candidate for Missouri’s 1st District.  He included a picture of Bush’s cases on a page in Casenet, a database for court cases. The picture shows eight court cases his opponent was involved in. Bush has 11 cases in all — but all of them are civil, not criminal. A criminal is someone who commits an offense against the state — a crime —  as opposed to a civil case, where one person or institution sues another, according to the American Bar Association. A con artist, according to Merriam-Webster, is ""a person who tricks other people in order to get their money.""  Bush’s 11 cases happened between 1999 and 2018. The types of cases are listed in Casenet as tax actions, landlord actions and contract actions.  For instance, Convergence Receivables LC received a default judgment against Bush and had her wages garnished. The company is one of a group of businesses known as debt buyers that purchase past-due accounts from businesses and then try to collect from individuals.  Bush’s cases show that she’s been in debt on multiple occasions — for rent, credit cards and tax issues. ""They look like a variety of collection actions,"" University of Missouri law professor Frank Bowman III said. ""I mean, it looks like she certainly had some trouble paying her bills from time to time."" Bush’s website attributes the delinquencies to her financial issues as a single mother.  ""Cori Bush’s tax burden was more than she could afford as a working class, single mother who was also paying off student loans for her nursing degree,"" the website reads.  The site acknowledges that Bush has dealt with lawsuits for not paying taxes and says Bush has also experienced homelessness. Bowman says these cases probably deal with delinquent or late payments, such as for local tax bills.  He also says Rogers should be careful about calling people criminals.  ""When you accuse someone of a crime, actually committing a crime, and they have not committed a crime, I mean, normally that's libelous,"" Bowman said.  When shown that all of Bush’s cases are civil and not criminal, Rogers said he still supports what he said in his Facebook post: that she is literally a criminal. In an email and an interview with Rogers, the candidate gave a number of claims about why Bush is still a con artist and criminal. Here’s what Rogers said. Bush has not sent in her personal financial disclosure to the House of Representatives. She pays herself with campaign contributions. She says she’s a pastor, but doesn’t work for a church.  She says she is a nurse but was ""disbarred."" We looked into each of his claims. According to the House of Representatives Office of the Clerk, Bush sent in her personal financial disclosure on Aug. 15. She was three months late. There is a $200 fine for every 30 days the disclosure is overdue, though House rules allow for extensions, according to the House of Representatives Committee on Ethics. It is unclear if Bush got an extension, as her team would not comment. Candidates are only prosecuted if they do not submit their disclosure at all, or if they falsify their disclosure documents. According to the FEC, it is legal to use campaign contributions as a salary. So far, Bush has reported wage expenses of $25,285 from her 2020 campaign. According to Bush’s website, she is an ordained pastor, and pastored at Kingdom Church  International in St. Louis, which she founded, from 2013-2015. Now she ""has since taken her faith-based work directly into the streets, where she serves as a spiritual support for the unhoused community."" According to Bush’s website, she did lose her certification as a nurse. After paying her outstanding tax debts, her nursing license was reinstated. Rogers called Bush a ""career criminal and a con artist"" on Facebook, but there is no evidence to suggest that Bush is either. The court cases Rogers provided as evidence were all civil cases.  None of the purported evidence provided by Rogers to back his claim held up to the facts, either. When told of our findings, Rogers insisted he was still right.  Due to his denial of the facts and baseless claims, we rate Rogers’ claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097555940>],/factchecks/2020/sep/29/anthony-rogers/cori-bushs-court-cases-arent-criminal-despite-clai/

No, this photo doesn’t show The Rock on Epstein Island
","On Sept. 27, an image of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson appeared on Facebook. He looks relaxed in a chair on a beach, smiling with a book by Sen. Elizabeth Warren in hand. A domed building looms on a hill behind him. ""Epstein Island,"" wrote an account that shared the image, referring to the private Carribean island owned by the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But the photo in the post is doctored and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The original image comes from the season five premiere of ""Ballers,"" the HBO show in which Johnson plays a former athlete turned manager.  But the building that appears in the image on Facebook — which looks like the blue-striped building on Little St. James, the island owned by Epstein — is not in the original.  That building also doesn’t appear in similar shots from ""Ballers"" that Warren’s campaign tweeted the night the show premiered. (She’s a big fan of the show.) ""You love to see it: @TheRock reading ‘This Fight is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America’s Middle Class’ by @ewarren,"" her campaign’s Twitter account wrote in August 2019. Johnson isn’t the first celebrity to be tangled in a social media hoax wrongly connecting some actors to Epstein. This particular allegation came only a few hours after Johnson, a retired professional wrestler who described himself as ""a political independent and centrist for many years,"" publicly endorsed Biden for president. But this picture of him on the beach is doctored.
