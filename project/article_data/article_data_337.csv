Flyer encouraging antifa to disguise themselves as Trump supporters is fake and old
","Across the country businesses have boarded up to protect against possible Election Day violence but a recent blog post suggesting that antifa activists will dress up like supporters of President Donald Trump and commit violence relies on an old, fake flyer with a debunked claim. ""Antifa gearing up for false flag violence disguised as Trump-supporters,"" reads the headline on the Nov. 3 post. The story claims that ""the progressive activists"" plan to riot while disguised as Trump supporters ""in order to make the case that Donald Trump truly is a dictator that must be violently overthrown if he wins or arrested and prosecuted if he loses.""  It says that ""a source that has always been reliable was able to photograph an Antifa flyer."" And an accompanying image of the supposed flyer reads: ""Election Day nears Comrades!!! Prepare to defend your rights!!"" It reminds ""Antifa Comrades"" to disguise themselves as ""patriots/Trump supporters"" on Nov. 4 by wearing ""MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias"" or ""a convincing police uniform."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, antifa stands for ""anti-fascist"" and refers to a broad, loose coalition of left-wing activists who protest white supremacy and other far-right causes. Sometimes antifa activists are violent but experts say most of the activity that happens under the antifa banner is nonviolent.  The image of the flyer has been online since at least 2017, when online rumors claimed that antifa activists were planning a revolution that would begin on Nov. 4.   It started to spread on social media after it appeared in a Facebook group called ""Hickman County Antifa."" The user who originally posted it there, Katy Krasnow, has told fact-checkers that she shared it as a joke.   ""Hickman County Antifa was a satire page,"" she told Snopes. ""I deleted soon after it got shared because it made a lot of people freak out more than I expected. Nobody in the group was really actually connected. We were just sharing dumb antifa memes."" In 2017, Will Sommer, a Daily Beast politics reporter who covers conservative media, described the flyer in a Medium post as one of several ""fabricated ‘planning documents’ that urge antifa guerillas to commit violence while posing as police or Trump supporters.""  In June, a Twitter account — @ANTIFA_US — appeared to call for violence, rallying ""comrades"" to move into residential areas and ""take what’s ours."" But the account wasn’t actually affiliated with antifa activists; it was created by a known white supremacist group.  And on Sept. 4, Law Enforcement Today, which ""unapologetically supports those who hold the Thin Blue Line,"" published a story about the flyer being shared on Facebook. ""While I personally loathe the likes of Antifa and their tactics,"" the author wrote, ""I can assure you that this is simply a hoax.""  We rate this blog post False.

Facebook post exaggerates isolated voting hiccup in Arkansas
","A pair of Arkansas voters who claimed they ran into trouble with a voting machine at the end of October are at the center of a Facebook post going viral roughly two weeks later. According to the story told on Facebook, two machines used at early voting polling centers in Russellville, Ark., were automatically counting ballots cast for President Donald Trump as votes for former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president. ""My two friends just voted at the Expo at Russellville,"" a Facebook user wrote in a now-hidden Oct. 20 post that’s been screenshotted and shared by others. ""When one of them voted for Trump and then waited to see how the machine tallied, it showed Biden!"" ""She spoke to the officials there,"" the screenshotted post continued. ""They tested the machines and two were registering Biden every time. They pulled those two machines. Folks, check your machine and paper before you leave your space. And speak up if it’s wrong!"" The story was picked up by a local Fox-affiliate, which described the Oct. 20 incident as an ""error"" that was promptly corrected by poll workers who removed the machine. But the screenshotted Facebook post misrepresented what happened, and elections security experts told PolitiFact the incident isn’t indicative of a wider problem. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The incident took place at the Pope County Election Headquarters, where Freddie Harris, chair of the Pope County Election Commission, was serving as a poll worker; it was not at a local business expo. And it didn’t involve multiple machines. ""I happened to be standing there when it happened,"" Harris said. The issue affected a man who arrived at the polling site with his wife. After poll workers moved the machine to a back room, Harris said the voter used another machine to cast his ballot as intended and flashed the workers a thumbs up on his way out the door. But Harris said the hiccup had been ""overexaggerated"" online and in the local press. ""It did not happen as reported,"" Harris told PolitiFact. ""But the machine did freeze up, and Biden’s name was lit up on the screen. And we pulled the machine and put it in the back."" In reality, the machine never recorded or looked like it would record a vote for Biden, Harris said, contradicting the claim in the Facebook post as well as the local Fox station’s report. Instead, the touch-screen froze, preventing the man from scrolling to vote for Trump. ""It did not check Biden,"" Harris said. ""The screen froze on the first screen. Biden’s name happens to be on the first screen, and you have to hit ‘more’ to go to the second screen.""  ""It did not compute to Biden,"" Harris said. ""It did not take anything away from Trump."" The issue was ""the result of a large number of candidates displayed and inadvertent touches as the voter scrolls down using the ‘more’ button to see all candidates,"" said Katina Granger, a spokesperson for Election Systems & Software, the Nebraska company behind the technology.  The screenshotted Facebook post was also wrong to claim that the incident involved multiple machines, and that it took place at a local business expo held at the River Valley Boys & Girls Club in Russellville. The Boys & Girls club isn’t a polling location for the city, Harris said. The incident was the first time Pope County had run into trouble with a voting machine, Harris said. She said voters should have ""no worries"" about problems with their votes. The county’s machines, known as ExpressVote systems, use ""touch-screen technology that produces a paper record for tabulation,"" according to Election Systems & Software’s website. The paper record is helpful, elections security experts said, because it gives voters a chance to review their selections and election officials a printed record to refer back to if necessary. ""While this issue is uncommon, voters should review their selections on the paper ballot and verify that their vote was recorded accurately before submitting for tabulation,"" said Granger, the Election Systems & Software spokesperson. Elections security experts said that while individual touch-screens are sometimes finicky or calibrated poorly, voters should not take isolated incidents as signs that the technology is flawed or untrustworthy, or as an indication that people behind the scenes are trying to alter their vote. ""I think this is a single, solitary problem with this one machine,"" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""We should be a little cautious of ascribing any ill intent or extrapolating this to be a bigger problem with the entire technology."" ""It's probably not anything nefarious, and there are scattered reports of this kind of problem in every election,"" added Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. The nation’s voting technology is ""far better than people understand it to be,"" Weil said, adding that ""people should be very confident in the process."" Poll workers are trained to deal with issues that come up, and voters who encounter problems should seek their help, Weil said. In Russellville, the poll workers were able to remedy the situation once they were alerted to it, and no ballots were cast in the wrong name. A Facebook post said broken voting machines in Russellville, Arkansas, tried to automatically tally votes meant for Donald Trump as votes for Joe Biden. A machine in Pope County did freeze on a voter in a way that prevented him from scrolling to cast his vote for Trump, said an elections official who was there when the incident took place.  But the machine never computed a vote for Biden or checked the box next to his name. The hiccup was quickly resolved and the voter was able to cast his ballot as intended. The incident involved just one machine, not two, Harris said. Election security experts said the isolated incident should not be extrapolated to suggest all elections technology is faulty. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical fact that would give a different impression. We rate this post Mostly False.

Pennsylvania residents under COVID-19 quarantine can cast an emergency absentee ballot
","On the eve of Election Day, a warning started to spread on social media that the state of Pennsylvania was undermining voters. ""After a reported ‘uptick' in Covid positive cases,"" a Facebook post said, ""thousands of Pennsylvania voters in York, Lebanon, and Dauphin counties have been receiving letters from the Department of Health demanding that they quarantine for 14 days.""  The post continued: ""The letter states that they’ve been exposed to Covid-19 (no proof given) and, as such, must remain quarantined and not vote in person on election day. If they fail to obey the order they face possible arrest. Do you believe the Wolf administration is attempting to silence voters — hours before the most important election in American history?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It coincided with some grim news from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, which announced on Nov. 2 a two-day total of nearly 4,000 new COVID-19 cases, and 28 consecutive days with more than 1,000 new reported cases. Rachel Levine, the state’s secretary of health, said the virus is now ""everywhere,"" spreading not just in big urban cities but in smaller, rural areas. We reached out to Pennsylvania officials about the Facebook claim and here’s the upshot: Everyone can vote, regardless of their quarantine status — it’s just that some may have to do it using an emergency absentee ballot, which can be requested on Election Day and must be returned to the county board of elections by 8 p.m. If the voter doesn’t have anyone who can return it for them, a county employee will be made available for the task. The Department of Health has been sending letters to Pennsylvania residents who have been identified as ""close contacts"" of people who have tested positive for COVID-19. These letters order recipients to quarantine. The letters don’t mention voting, but the rules of quarantine do prohibit someone from showing up at the polls on Election Day. However, the state provides that these voters can still cast an emergency absentee ballot, despite the quarantine.  Here’s what we know. The letter orders recipients to quarantine for 14 days from the date of last contact with the person with COVID-19. Recipients who live with the infected person must self-quarantine for 14 days starting on the date the person with COVID-19 is released from isolation.  ""A person can develop the virus and become infectious between 2 to 14 days after exposure,"" the letter says, ""therefore, you must quarantine for the entire 14 days even if you have had a negative test during this time."" Only health care workers abiding by certain requirements are allowed to leave the place where they are quarantined. State officials did not respond directly to multiple questions PolitiFact asked about whether someone would face arrest if they defied the quarantine order and showed up at the polls. The letter health officials sent doesn’t explicitly mention the possibility of arrest.  It warns, however, that ""if you do not cooperate with this directive, the Secretary of Health may petition a court to have you confined to an appropriate place chosen by the Department to make certain that you are not able to infect the public, and to make certain that you receive proper care. This may be a hospital, or some other appropriate place, whichever the Department determines is best suited for your case. … Law enforcement may be called upon, to the extent necessary, to ensure your compliance with this directive."" Lyndsay Kensinger, press secretary for Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, told us ""people under quarantine can still exercise their right to vote using an emergency absentee ballot."" They can either have someone pick up and return their emergency ballot on their behalf or, if no one is available, the law requires the county to send a sheriff’s deputy or another county employee to help provide and return the ballot, Kensinger said. Pennsylvania residents can apply for an emergency ballot through Election Day.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Pennsylvania has mailed letters to some directing them quarantine, Kensinger said. ""The significant uptick in cases we’re seeing means a corresponding uptick in letters,"" she said. The state identifies the close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 through contract tracing. ""We urge those directed to isolate or quarantine to follow all instructions contained in the letters they receive, and to exercise their right to vote,"" Kensinger said.  Our ruling The Facebook post claims that letters from Pennsylvania’s Department of Health order people to quarantine and not vote in person on Election Day. The post suggests that this is a voter suppression effort. In actuality, the state has been issuing quarantine directives to close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic began in March. These letters do order recipients to quarantine, but they don’t mention voting. The letters also warn that the state’s health secretary could call on the courts or law enforcement to intervene if the recipients do not cooperate.  However, those under quarantine can still cast an emergency ballot until 8 p.m. on Election Day.  We rate this post Mostly False.

Video gives misleading impression of Mass. voting rules
","A video posted on TikTok seeks to cast doubt in the integrity of elections in Massachusetts by claiming that people can vote for other voters as long as they have their information. A woman in the video said she went to vote in a primary election (she doesn’t specify when), that she’s a registered independent from Boston. ""Not once,"" she says, did people at the polling station ask her for identification. She says she was told she didn’t need an ID because she was already registered to vote. ""Now here’s my deal. I have two sisters that look a little like me, what’s stopping me right now from throwing on a mask, changing my clothes and going back out there to vote two more times in my favor?"" said the woman in the video. ""So basically, anybody can go vote for anybody so long as they have their information. We are worried about voter mail-in fraud. They're not even checking IDs at the polling stations."" PolitiFact reached out to the Massachusetts state office that oversees elections for data on instances of voter fraud as described in the TikTok. Debra O’Malley, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, told PolitiFact she was not aware of any in-person voter impersonation cases in Massachusetts. O’Malley said there are certain circumstances in which voters may be asked for identification, but it is not required to be a photo ID. Acceptable types of ID include a recent utility bill or any other printed identification which contains the voter's name and address. The secretary of state’s website says people may be asked to show identification when they check in at a polling station for any of the following reasons: Voting for the first time in Massachusetts in a federal election; Inactive voter; Casting a provisional or challenged ballot; The poll worker has a reasonable suspicion that leads them to request identification. There is a police officer in every polling place to help enforce the election laws, O’Malley said. While Massachusetts doesn't have a photo ID requirement for voting, ""there's no evidence of widespread impersonation fraud in jurisdictions that lack photo ID requirements,"" said Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos, a professor at Harvard Law School whose expertise includes election law. A person would also be committing a crime if they assert someone else’s identity to vote, Stephanopoulos said. An attempt to impersonate a voter could also be detected if that other person has already voted, or the crime could be caught once the actual voter goes to the polls, he said. Massachusetts law says that ""whoever votes or attempts to vote in any name other than his own, or knowingly casts or attempts to cast more than one ballot at one time of balloting; or whoever votes or attempts to vote otherwise illegally, shall be punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than five years, or both."" News21, a student reporting project based at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, in 2012 analyzed 2,068 alleged election-fraud cases since 2000. The study found that in-person voter impersonation was ""virtually nonexistent."" The National Conference of State Legislatures says there are 36 states that have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, 35 of which are in force in 2020. A video posted on TikTok claimed that in Massachusetts, ""anybody can go vote for anybody so long as they have their information. … They're not even checking IDs at the polling stations."" Massachusetts does not require that everyone show an ID in order to vote, but there are some instances when people will be asked to show an ID before voting. The video ignores that voting or attempting to vote under someone else’s name is not permissible, it is illegal. The video also implies that the absence of an ID requirement at polls is conducive to voter fraud. An election law expert said there's no evidence of widespread impersonation fraud in places that lack photo ID requirements.

Voters choosing more on party than personality, but Trump is the exception for some
","In a year and an election that has been polarized at every turn, are voters focusing more on party or personality? That’s the question a freshman state representative addressed while discussing — in part — how President Donald Trump is faring among suburban women. Those voters are a key demographic for Trump, one he has been overtly courting in the runup to the presidential election. At a mid-October rally in Pennsylvania. Trump declared: ""Suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please."" As part of an Oct. 25, 2020, segment on suburban women on WISN-TV’s UpFront program, state Rep. Robyn Vining said this: ""We get a lot of calls from national press asking what’s happening here so that they can try and understand what the shift is in the suburbs, but I think people are less likely to just vote for party now,"" said Vining, D-Wauwatosa. ""I really believe that they vote for people, so they’re looking at the personalities who are running for office — who can they trust? It’s not just who do I want to have a beer with now, it’s also who can I trust, who can I trust to fight for me like they’re fighting for their own family. And I think moms look at it that way."" So Vining was presumably asked about Trump’s support in the suburbs — the TV clip doesn’t show what exactly she was responding to — but her statement offers a broad assertion that voters in 2020 are considering personality more than they have in the past. Let’s take a look. If we interpret Vining’s comment to narrowly address suburban women’s response to Trump, there’s a truth there. ""It is clear that their support for Trump actually has dropped off quite a lot,"" said Kenneth Mayer, professor of American politics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""All of the data point to the fact that what is changing the attitudes of these voters is Trump, his sort of personality and operating style."" A New York Times analysis by UCLA Professor Lynn Vavreck said polls show suburban white women are among the groups with the largest swings away from Trump in 2020 compared to 2016. But Vining’s statement seems to make a broader claim about voters choosing based on personality, and ""the evidence does not support that,"" Mayer said. The frequency of ticket splitting — voters who support candidates from multiple parties on the same ballot — and the general polarization of the country show Americans are making party-based decisions now more than ever. An analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com found ticket splitting hit an all-time low in 2018, the last time many states had an election offering voters a candidate from multiple parties in a statewide election (senator and governor, for instance). The median difference between the margin of victory in the senate and gubernatorial races has regularly declined since at least 1998, hitting a low in 2018. In other words, voters are increasingly unlikely to vote for one party for senate and another for governor.  That analysis concluded ""more voters are casting straight-ticket ballots. There are exceptions, of course, but this shift matches what we know about the larger electoral picture: voters are more partisan and the country is more divided than it’s ever been in the modern era of U.S. politics."" A Pew Research Center poll conducted Sept. 30 to Oct. 5 found only 4% of registered voters supported Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden and a U.S. Senate candidate from the opposing party. And Trump’s approval rating offers further proof of the polarization, particularly when it comes to the president. The party split on his approval rating is the largest ever recorded by the Gallup poll, which goes back to President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. In the Oct. 16-27, 2020, Gallup poll, 95% of Republicans approved of Trump’s work in the White House, compared to 3% of Democrats — a 92-point gap. Before Trump, the largest gap recorded was a 77-point difference during President Barack Obama’s last year in office. Vining said, ""People are less likely to just vote for party now. … They’re looking at the personalities."" Looking narrowly at Trump’s support among suburban women, there’s a case this is accurate. Trump’s abrasive approach doesn’t appear to be resonating with that group, and fewer appear likely to support him than in 2016. But Vining’s comment was more general than that. And broadly speaking, party is playing a growing role in voters’ decisions — not a shrinking one. Voters are less likely than in the past to cast ballots supporting candidates from multiple parties. And they’re more likely than ever to agree with people from their own party when assessing something like the president’s job performance. We rate this claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2020/nov/02/robyn-vining/voters-choosing-more-party-personality-trump-excep/

Trump’s Butler, Pa., rally drew thousands of supporters, but there’s no evidence it was 57,000
","Leading up to Election Day, President Donald Trump continued to hold large rallies with thousands of attendees, despite health officials’ warnings against large gatherings amid a spike of COVID-19 cases in several states. But some posts on social media appeared to inflate the attendance numbers.  One Facebook post claims that a Trump rally held in Pennsylvania on Halloween had a crowd of nearly 60,000, which would make it Trump’s largest rally ever. ""At Trump's Butler, PA rally alone, a whopping 57,000+ people came out to see him. Off the charts enthusiasm!"" the post reads. Thousands of supporters attended the event north of Pittsburgh, but we found no evidence the number is as high as the post claims. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The rally was held at the Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport and marked Trump’s third campaign stop of the day in the state. No official attendance number has been released, but the Penn Township Police Department told us that officers at the event estimated there were about 15,000 people in attendance.  The Butler Eagle, the county’s daily newspaper, reported that ""more than 10,000 people"" showed up to the event. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said that bus drivers who ferried supporters from their cars to the airport in the afternoon were told to expect about 15,000. One bus company, Campbell Bus Lines, told PolitiFact it had 45 buses transporting people at the event for about two and a half hours, and estimated there were probably around 10,000 to 12,000 people. The 57,000 figure seems to stem from a tweet by Sebastian Gorka, a former White House aide in the Trump administration. ""According to my friend Denise, who was at the last rally in Butler, PA, the @SecretService put the crowd at 57,000. Did you get that?"" Tweet embed We reached out to the Secret Service to verify the number but did not hear back. We also contacted the Trump campaign and Butler County and got no response.

No evidence that Kamala Harris’ husband represents the Chinese Communist Party
","A Facebook post suggests that lawyer Douglas Emhoff, Sen. Kamala Harris’ husband, has close ties to the Chinese government. ""Kamala’s husband, a lawyer, represents the Communist Chinese Party in America!! Think about that!!"" the Oct. 30 post reads. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because the claim doesn’t hold water.  Douglas Emhoff isn’t practicing law at the moment, but he used to specialize in entertainment, business and real estate. In August, when Harris became the Democratic nominee for vice president, he took a leave of absence from DLA Piper, where he has been a partner in Los Angeles since 2017, to avoid the appearance that he and his wife had any conflicts of interest.  We found no evidence that Emhoff has ever represented the Chinese Communist Party.  Reports in the New York Times and the Washington Post about Emhoff’s legal career  don’t note any connections to the Chinese Communist Party.  Emhoff is not required to publicly disclose a full list of his clients by federal law and we find no record that he has. The Biden/Harris campaign did not respond to our inquiry about his clients in time for publication.  However, we searched for a possible source for the Facebook post’s allegations and found a Sept. 5 article published by National Pulse, a conservative news site led by former Breitbart editor Raheem Kassam. National Pulse does not claim that Emhoff was a member of the CCP or that he represented the Chinese government. Rather, the story speculates that Emhoff’s past employment at the firm could constitute a conflict of interest for Harris because the law firm allegedly ""employs a host of former Chinese Communist Party officials"" and has represented some state-affiliated Chinese companies. The second-largest law firm in the U.S., DLA Piper employs lawyers in more than 40 countries. Of the nearly 4,000 attorneys working for the firm, the National Pulse article identifies two employees with ties to the Chinese Communist Party, both of whom work in Hong Kong. (Emhoff is based in California.) It also notes that a consultant at the firm ""advised"" the Chinese embassy in Canberra, Australia, and that a DLA Piper lawyer represented investors in deals with Bytedance, the parent company of TikTok.  In addition, the article reports that the firm represented some state-backed companies, including two Chinese airlines and the China Merchants Group, a government-owned conglomerate based in Hong Kong. However, the story doesn’t provide evidence that Emhoff himself represented these companies. A DLA Piper press release about the firm’s involvement with the China Merchants Group mentions two other lawyers leading the negotiations.  Foreign policy experts told PolitiFact that none of this proves that the firm is subject to undue CCP influence. Rather, it reflects the way that business and government are intertwined in China.  In the U.S., corporations generally operate as independent actors, whereas in China, the Communist Party routinely exercises influence over companies and businesses. As China analyst Ashley Feng wrote in Foreign Policy, ""Chinese domestic laws and administrative guidelines, as well as unspoken regulations and internal party committees, make it quite difficult to distinguish between what is private and what is state-owned."" David Dollar, the U.S. Treasury’s former economic and financial emissary to China, told PolitiFact that the sheer number of Chinese Communist Party members makes it difficult for multinational firms to avoid them entirely.  ""The CCP has about 90 million members, so it would be difficult to do business in China without doing business with some of them,"" he wrote in an email.  If DLA Piper has CCP party members on its payroll, that doesn’t indicate that it has close ties to the Chinese government, Dollar said. Rather, it’s a reflection of the way that business and government in the country overlap. A Facebook post claims, ""Kamala’s husband, a lawyer, represents the Communist Chinese Party in America!!"" We could find no evidence that Douglas Emhoff has represented the CCP. Emhoff is currently on leave from his law firm.  The post seems to inaccurately summarize an article in National Pulse, which alleges that several employees of DLA Piper have ties to the CCP.  However, foreign policy experts told us that it’s difficult for a multinational firm to entirely avoid doing business with the CCP, when over 90 million Chinese are party members.  We rate this post False.

Party leaders quickly amended it to restore language from 2008 about helping people ""make the most of their God-given potential."" The party’s 2020 platform includes the same reference to ""God-given potential,"" but critics continue to cite the 2012 omission. One Facebook post says, ""Dems have removed any mention of ‘God’ from their Platform. Why are they getting support from any Christian?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) When the 2012 platform was unveiled and did not include the word God, Democrats, under pressure from President Barack Obama, quickly changed it. The Washington Post reported at the time that a press secretary for the Democratic National Committee called it a ""faux controversy,"" referred to a section of the platform about faith and pointed out there were multiple uses of the words faith, religion, religious, church and clergy.  The 2020 platform similarly includes references to faith and religion, including a section titled ""Supporting Faith and Service,"" that reads, ""Religious freedom is a core American value and a core value of the Democratic Party. Democrats will protect the rights of each American for the free exercise of his or her own religion. It will be the policy of the Democratic Administration to advocate for religious freedom throughout the world."" It also says, ""Democrats remain committed to ending poverty and enabling all Americans to live up to their God-given potential.""  We reached out to the Democratic National Committee for comment but did not receive a reply. Over time, the Democratic Party has reduced its use of the word God in its platform. In 2004, the platform included the phrase ""one nation under God,"" and also referred to ""God’s children,"" ""eyes of God"" and ""God’s gifts."" In 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020, the only references to God in the platform were to ""God-given potential."" A search of the Republican Party platform turns up 16 mentions of the word ""God."" A Facebook post says that ""Dems have removed any mention of ‘God’ from their Platform."" That’s not true, as the party’s 2020 platform includes a reference to ""God-given potential."" It also makes numerous references to faith, including a section that outlines its intent to protect religious freedom and uphold ""separation of church and state enshrined in our Constitution."" The Democratic Party in 2012 introduced a platform that did not mention God, only to quickly re-insert the reference. The party’s platforms in recent years have had fewer mentions of the word God than in the past. But the assertion that the Democratic Party platform doesn’t include a reference to God is wrong.

Fact-checking Trump’s claim that his supporters were ‘protecting’ Biden’s campaign bus in Texas
","Videos posted on Twitter show a Joe Biden campaign bus traveling on a highway, surrounded by trucks and other vehicles flying Trump flags. The Biden campaign has said that the vehicles tried to slow down the bus and run it off the road, and that staffers called 911, concerned for their safety. President Donald Trump had a different take on the incident. ""You see the way our people, they, you know, they were protecting his bus yesterday,"" Trump said Nov. 1 during a rally in Michigan. ""Because they are nice. They had hundreds of cars."" The FBI’s San Antonio office said Nov. 1 that it is ""aware of the incident and investigating."" Trump’s benevolent explanation lacks evidence. The incident in question happened Friday, not Saturday. Neither Biden nor Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris were on the bus. Aboard were campaign staffers and Wendy Davis, a Texas Democratic congressional candidate, Biden’s campaign said. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our request for information. Biden’s campaign said that on Oct. 30, a Biden campaign bus was traveling on I-35 in Texas from San Antonio to Austin ""when multiple vehicles with Trump signs and flags surrounded the bus and attempted to slow the bus down and run it off the road. They pulled in front of the bus and slowed down to try to stop the bus in the middle of the highway."" Staff on the bus called the police, which assisted the bus in reaching its destination, the campaign said. The campaign said it canceled its events that day at the Texas AFL-CIO parking lot in Austin and that law enforcement came to help staff, surrogates and volunteers get off of the bus. ""Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm’s way,"" said in a statement Tariq Thowfeek, the Texas communications director for the Biden campaign. Katie Naranjo, chair of the Travis County Democratic Party, tweeted Oct. 30 that Trump supporters ""followed the Biden bus throughout central Texas to intimidate Biden supporters. They ran into a person's car, yelling curse words and threats."" John Hinojosa captured a video of the incident that was verified by the social media intelligence agency Storyful. (It was later deleted.) Hinojosa told Storyful that he was on the way to pick up his grandchild between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. when he saw the scene on the highway. ""I thought it was bad traffic for a Friday,"" Hinojosa told Storyful, but then he started recording from his phone when he realized what was going on. A separate video, posted by someone else on Twitter, shows a side-by-side collision between a white SUV, which does not appear to have any flags, and a black truck with flags trailing the Biden bus. The Texas Tribune reported that a local police department said it had not spoken to either of the drivers in the collision and had not determined who was at fault.

Trump’s misleading attack on Biden’s health care plan
","A TV ad by President Donald Trump’s campaign portrays Joe Biden’s health care plan as a disaster for seniors’ access to health care. ""Let’s turn off the noise and look at the facts about Joe Biden and Kamala Harrs’ government-run health care plan,"" states the narrator, a senior citizen, in the ad. ""Their plan could lead to hospitals being closed, put Medicare coverage at risk, and give benefits to illegal immigrants. Their plan is just too dangerous for seniors like us."" Point by point, the ad misleads about Biden’s health care plan.  This is misleading. Biden hasn’t called for only a government plan-run plan. The ad cited a July 2019 NBC story about Biden’s health care agenda. Biden does not support Medicare for All; his plan instead builds upon the Affordable Care Act. He supports allowing Americans to buy into a public option for government-managed health insurance. The public option would be offered alongside other private health insurance plans on the marketplace. The ad also cited an article by the conservative Heritage Foundation  which analyzed several plans in Congress and concluded that the public option would lead to a ""single government-controlled health care system."" But that’s not in line with what Biden has proposed. This assertion hinges in part on the false premise that Biden is proposing Medicare for All. Again, he isn’t. Biden’s plan calls for taking steps to keep rural hospitals open, including supporting a bipartisan bill in Congress to save rural hospitals in part by increasing payments to Medicare providers. The ad cites as evidence a New York Times article in April 2019 that states that if Medicare for All abolished private insurance and reduced rates some hospitals, especially in struggling rural centers, ""would close virtually overnight.""  The Trump campaign also pointed to an August 2019 study conducted by Navigant, a consulting firm, that predicted rural hospitals are in danger of closing under a public option. The study was commissioned by the Partnership for America’s Healthcare Future, a health industry coalition that opposes Medicare for All and a public option. The study modeled what would happen to rural hospitals, which are already at risk of closing, if three separate public option approaches were implemented — but it didn’t mention Biden’s plan. It found that a public option could lead to 28% to 55% of rural hospitals being at high risk of closure. The study reached these findings by assuming that the hospitals would be paid at Medicare rates.  Some health policy experts argue that a public option would actually help rural hospitals by increasing the number of people in rural areas who have health insurance. This would ""benefit rural hospitals, since getting virtually nothing from uninsured patients is worse than getting a reasonably good rate from the public option,"" Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, previously told us. It’s too early to say how Medicare could be affected by Biden’s plan to add a public option. The ad cited the same Heritage Foundation research that argues broadly that the public option would eventually lead to the end of private alternatives and that doctors who don’t sign up for the public option could be forbidden from participating in Medicare. It also raises concerns about government-set payment rates. But, again, it doesn’t specifically zero in on Biden’s proposal. The Trump campaign pointed to a September article by the Partnership for America’s Healthcare Future that cites articles — including by PolitiFact — that show a public option could disrupt private insurance offerings. A new public option, the partnership says, would strain government financing when Medicare is already at risk. The Trump campaign also pointed to comments by Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and a former health official in the Obama administration, in the New York Times. Glied said that it was possible that linking public-option coverage to Medicare could cause some doctors to stop accepting Medicare patients. Parts of Biden’s plan suggest he is comparing the public option and Medicare, the Trump campaign said. For example, Biden’s plan says both programs will negotiate prices with providers and that a board will recommend a reasonable price for new specialty drugs. But two experts we interviewed said Biden’s health care plan lacks enough detail to lend itself to the conclusion that it will put Medicare coverage at risk. ""There's not really enough detail in the Biden plan yet to say one way or another,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a professor and expert on health insurance at Georgetown University. ""There's nothing inherent in what Biden has proposed that would put traditional Medicare at risk."" If Biden is elected, he would have to write detailed legislation that would explain how the public option would interact with other health insurance, including Medicare.  Practically speaking, candidates running for president know not to propose a harmful Medicare plan, said Joe Antos, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. This goes too far. Biden’s plan doesn’t automatically ""give benefits"" to immigrants in the country illegally. Biden favors allowing immigrants illegally in the country to buy health care plans under the Affordable Care Act marketplace, but without financial help from the government.  For evidence, the ad cites the June 27, 2019, Democratic primary debate where all of the candidates were asked to ""raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants."" All raised their hands, including Biden. The Democrats were asked whether their health care plans would cover immigrants here illegally. They were not, however, directly asked if that coverage would be free. When moderator Savannah Guthrie asked Biden to elaborate, he said: ""You cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered."" He didn’t get into the specifics about paying for the coverage, although he said that immigrants in the U.S. illegally pay the Social Security tax. RELATED: Donald Trump gives false version of Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders ‘unity’ policy on immigrants Trump’s TV ad said, ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harrs’ government-run health care plan … could lead to hospitals being closed, put Medicare coverage at risk, and give benefits to illegal immigrants."" Biden has not called for only a government-run plan. He has called for a voluntary public option alongside private options.  The ad leaps to conclusions about how Biden’s plan would impact hospitals and Medicare coverage, relying largely on articles by groups that oppose the public option. Experts said Biden’s plan doesn’t include enough specifics to reach conclusions, but it’s a stretch to conclude that he would put Medicare coverage at risk. The study the campaign cited about the public option leading to rural hospital closures cites a huge range and makes some assumptions and also acknowledges that rural hospitals are already closing. The only kernel here is that Biden’s plan allows immigrants here illegally to pay for health insurance, but it’s misleading to state that he would ""give"" them the benefits.

Trump spokesman Jason Miller paints dubious picture of Election Night
","With Election Day almost here, an adviser to President Donald Trump’s campaign went on national television to paint a rosy picture of how the incumbent’s chances of winning will look on Election Night — and to accuse Democrats in advance of trying to rip away his reelection. Here’s what Jason Miller said during a Nov. 1 interview with host George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week: ""If you speak with many smart Democrats, they believe that President Trump will be ahead on Election Night, probably getting 280 electoral (votes), somewhere in that range, and then they're going try to steal it back after the election,"" Miller said. ""We believe that we will be over 290 electoral votes on Election Night. So no matter what they try to do, what kind of hijinks or lawsuits or whatever kind of nonsense they try to pull off, we're still going to have enough electoral votes to get President Trump reelected."" We can’t predict the future, but Miller’s assertion that Trump ""will be over 290 electoral votes on Election Night"" is dubious on several levels. Electoral votes won’t be cast for more than another month, for one. The early, partial returns could in fact be relatively favorable to Trump, because many states are faster at counting Election Day in-person votes than mail ballots. And in 2020, the method of voting has demonstrated a partisan skew. For months, Trump has criticized mail balloting, which has made Republicans more likely to decide to cast their vote on Election Day. For instance, a national USA Today Suffolk University poll found that of the one-third of all voters who said they were planning to vote on Election Day, 48% were Republicans, more than twice as large as the Democratic share of 20%. With in-person ballots being disproportionately counted and reported first, it could look on Election Night that Trump is ahead in some battleground states, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Miller’s decision to focus on these early returns ""sets up the Trump campaign, on Election Night, to go with either ‘I won’ or ‘we don’t know yet, but I won,’"" said Colorado State University political scientist Kyle Saunders. ""In turn, that uncertainty leaves the window open to interpretation and even judicial action after the fact that could affect the outcome."" However, declaring victory after just a fraction of the votes are counted would be like declaring you’ve won a football game at the start of the fourth quarter in a close game. Miller is wrong to suggest that only legal ""hijinks"" can justify counting ballots after Election Night. As we’ve noted, this not only includes ordinary mail ballots but also overseas military ballots and provisional ballots, the late-counting rules for which are enshrined in both federal and state law.  In fact, federal law allows states until more than a month after the election to finalize their results. Electoral votes are not cast until Dec. 14, and Congress officially counts them on Jan. 6. So at the very least, Miller should have said that Trump would have enough states ""called"" in his favor on Election Night to add up to 290 electoral votes.  However, even this assertion is problematic. Media organizations, primarily the television networks and the Associated Press, have ""decision desks"" that determine when enough results are available to allow them to ""call"" a race. No decision desk recommends a call when the race is close and when just a fraction of the total has been reported — and especially this year when they are well aware that ballots cast by mail might have quite different patterns of results than ballots cast in person. ""The network decision desks are not going to make projections based on partial information or without a complete portrait of what the electorate is in a state,"" said ABC News political director Rick Klein. ""The first wave of election results will not be enough for any media organization to make a projection. We’re very dialed in to that reality."" So, states that are rated as ""too early to call"" or ""too close to call"" by media organizations can’t simply be put into the tentative leader’s column of states they’ve ""won."" Designating states as too close to call is done specifically to avoid giving a candidate premature ownership of a state’s result. To reach 290 electoral votes on Election Night, Trump would need to have the media call every state that's safe or likely to support Trump for the president, plus each of the following states that are considered significantly in play (and which in some cases have Biden polling leads): Texas, Ohio, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Maine's 2nd congressional district, Florida, Arizona, Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. (Both Maine and Nebraska allocate electoral votes to each of their congressional districts, and one district in each state is considered to be in play between the candidates.) It’s also unlikely that enough information would be available to decision desks on Election Night to make a call in at least some of those states, especially Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In Pennsylvania, counties say they might not start counting mail ballots until the day after the election.  ""Election administrators are going to do their very best to do things as accurately and as quickly as they can, but they are limited in their resources,"" Saunders said. ""These things just take time."" The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Miller said, ""We will be over 290 electoral votes on Election Night ... no matter what they try to do, what kind of hijinks or lawsuits or whatever kind of nonsense they try to pull off."" No candidate will ""be over 290 electoral votes"" on Election Night, because electoral votes aren’t cast until Dec. 14 and won’t be counted until Jan. 6. Beyond that, Miller is miscasting how media organizations will call races for one candidate or the other on Election Night. Media outlets won’t be calling any battleground states until there’s adequate information to do so with confidence. If a state hasn’t yet counted enough votes from mail ballots to have a sense of how mail voters are breaking between the candidates, media organizations won’t call the states for either candidate; they’ll call it ""too early to call"" or ""too close to call."" It would be inaccurate to count a media organization’s ""too close to call"" state as part of either the Trump column or the Biden column, even if partial returns show that candidate ahead.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Rick Scott']","
Blame Joe Biden for inflation? Most government spending came earlier
","With a vote on raising the federal debt limit looming, Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott is pressing the case that spending has to come down. In Scott’s view, there’s clear proof that Democratic fiscal policies have already made it harder for average families to pay their bills. ""Thanks to the insane tax-and-spending spree of President Joe Biden and Democrats in Washington, we are seeing six straight months of raging inflation,"" Scott said in a July 26 press release. Senate Republicans, led by Scott, followed that up with a press conference on inflation. Scott pointed to a chart showing rising prices for household essentials, like gasoline, milk and eggs. Prices have gone up, in some cases, sharply. Gasoline costs 45% more than a year ago. (Energy prices can jump up and down rapidly.) Used cars and trucks are also up 45%.  Compared with a year ago, the consumer price index was up 5.4% in June, the fastest pace since August 2008. There’s no question that high levels of government spending can fuel inflation. But the spending that has occurred since Biden took office, primarily through the American Rescue Plan, accounts for just a part of new government spending over the past 18 months.   Other potential factors are also at play in raising prices: short-term supply interruptions, labor shortages, tariffs on imported goods, or simply the cyclical growth in consumer demand when the economy is recovering from a downturn.  Economists looking at today’s inflation caution that the precise cause is hard to pin down, and they vary on how much impact the most recent spending is having.  But all of them underscore that heavy spending isn’t just a Biden administration phenomenon. It started over a year ago, as the government tried to protect Americans and the economy from the ravages of COVID-19. In reviewing Washington’s actions, we look at actual spending, rather than the maximum amount allowed under any measure. That’s because where inflation is concerned, what matters is when the money gets into people’s pockets. There have been several major coronavirus relief packages. The largest was the CARES Act, passed in March 2020 and signed by President Donald Trump. According to the Covid Money Tracker from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, that bill has put $1.97 trillion into the economy to date. The CARES Act provided such pillars of federal aid as the Paycheck Protection Program for companies and their workers, and expanded unemployment benefits for the millions of people who lost their jobs. Congress refilled the Paycheck Protection Program in April 2020, along with other aid, at a cost of about $500 billion. In December 2020, Congress passed additional relief, including $600 checks for most Americans. About $770 billion has been spent so far. The most recent bill was the American Rescue Plan Act championed by Biden and congressional Democrats and signed in March 2021. So far, spending from that has reached $1.05 trillion. The U.S. Treasury Department’s COVID-19 page shows that overall, as of the end of May 2021, federal agencies had spent or committed about $3.5 trillion since the pandemic began. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, using different methods, puts the latest tally at about $4.45 trillion. 
There are other amounts that can be folded into the totals, but it’s safe to say about two-thirds of the spending took place before Biden took office. ""I wouldn't ascribe the government spending necessarily to Biden, as the increase in government spending to help curb the effects of COVID was already occurring during the Trump administration,"" said Columbia University economist Jennifer La’O. Scott spoke of ""six straight months of raging inflation."" That’s an exaggeration. The consumer price index has been rising this year, but on a month-to-month basis, inflation didn’t start accelerating significantly until March. (We look at month-to-month changes, rather than year-over-year, because 2020 was such an unusual year.) In January, prices went up 0.3%. February’s increase was 0.4%. That’s lower than in June and July the year before. But between March and June this year, the Consumer Price Index had an average monthly increase of 0.7%. 
The prices of some goods, such as gasoline and used cars, have gone up dramatically. Other increases are more modest, but they’re still important for household budgets. Grocery prices are up 0.9%. Clothing is nearly 5% more expensive. Across the board, the cost of living rose 0.9%. Economy watchers look less at that topline number, and more at what is driving it. It turns out the used cars and trucks accounted for a third of the overall increase in the CPI. Federal Reserve Bank chairman Jerome Powell said that’s unlikely to last. ""Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply,"" Powell said at a June 16 news conference. A global shortage of semiconductor chips has curtailed vehicle production and thinned new-car inventories, so more buyers have turned to used car and trucks, pushing up prices in that market. Eventually, Powell said, supply chains will get back on track and the surge will ease. That’s what happened with an earlier spike in lumber prices. There is a risk of more deeply embedded inflation, but there are few signs of that so far. Economics 101 holds that when you add hundreds of billions of dollars to an economy, at least some people will go out and buy things. If supply doesn’t ramp up at a commensurate pace, increased demand will lead to higher prices. Macroeconomist John Leahy at the University of Michigan thinks Washington’s spending since last spring is fueling that type of cycle. ""The root cause of inflation is most likely the increase in aggregate demand for goods, and this increase in demand has been caused in part by the increase in government spending,"" Leahy said. ""Supply bottlenecks help to explain why supply has not kept pace with demand, but they are not prime mover."" Stanford University economist Peter Klenow has no quibble with that basic idea, but he says he’s skeptical that much of this tracks back to Biden. Klenow points to studies like one from the New York Federal Reserve that found that only about 30% of stimulus money was spent on goods. About 70% of the money went into savings or paid down debt. That money wouldn’t spur demand or lead to higher prices. Klenow also doubts that a relief package passed in March 2021 would drive up inflation just three months later. ""Estimates of the effects of government spending in earlier years typically find a lag of a year or two between the spending and any noticeable effect on inflation,"" Klenow said. One final point on inflation and tax policy: Scott talked about Democrats’ ""tax and spending spree."" While Biden has said he would like to raise taxes on corporations and on people making over $400,000 a year, that has yet to happen. That aside, Leahy said that in the short run, taxes tend to trim demand, and reduce inflationary pressures. ""Tax hikes on consumers reduce disposable income and thereby reduce consumer spending,"" Leahy said. ""Tax hikes on business tend to reduce profits and thereby reduce investment.

However, most of the big spending coursing through the economy took place before Biden and the Democrats were in charge in Washington. In the past, there’s been a lag of one to two years between higher government spending and higher inflation. The massive relief package in March has had little time to spur inflation. As for taxes, they haven’t gone up. And if they had, that would tend to put the brakes on inflation.

An Italian journalist’s comments have been misattributed to French President Emmanuel Macron
","After Emmanual Macron announced that residents would face restrictions if they remain unvaccinated against COVID-19, a forceful statement attributed to the French president started to spread among people supportive of the country’s action.  ""I no longer have any intention of sacrificing my life, my time, my freedom and the adolescence of my daughters, as well as their right to study properly, for those who refuse to be vaccinated,"" he said to ""anti-vaxxers,"" according to a quote shared on Instagram. ""This time you stay home, not us.""  The post also quotes Macron as saying, ""We cannot make those who have the civic sense to get vaccinated bear the burden of inconvenience,"" and ""the restrictions will weigh on others, those who for reasons incomprehensible in the country of Louis Pasteur, science and the Enlightenment still hesitate to use the only weapon available against the pandemic, the vaccine.""    This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As Alex Hern, a technology editor at the Guardian, pointed out on July 21, Macron doesn’t have adolescent daughters. He has no biological children. His wife, Brigitte Macron, has three children from another marriage — including one son — and they’re all in their 30s and 40s. Italian journalist Selvaggia Lucarelli tweeted at Hern that the statement originated with her.

""I confirm those were my words,"" she wrote on July 21. She linked to the original post on her Facebook page.  The July 13 Facebook post, translated to English from Italian, wrote: ""I no longer have any intention of sacrificing my life, time, freedom and adolescence of my son as well as his right to study properly, for anyone who refuses to vaccinate themselves. This time you’re staying home to yourself, not us.""  She also posted it on Instagram.  In both posts Lucarelli quotes Macron making the second two statements that appear in the Instagram post misattributing her own words to the French president.  He did describe France as a country of science, Enlightenment and Louis Pasteur, though the exact translation appears differently online depending on the source.

Rumors that scammers are posing as door-to-door COVID testers are not backed up
","Rumors that con artists and robbers have been going door to door pretending to offer COVID-19 tests have been stoking fear on social media since the beginning of the pandemic.  ""Law enforcement and the Red Cross have advised that there are people going door to door indicating that they are authorized to do testing for Coronavirus,"" a trending Facebook post from April 2020 reads. ""Do not let them in. Call the police! Please pass this on and alert families!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The American Red Cross as well as law enforcement officials across the country and in the United Kingdom have responded to such social media posts by explaining that no authorized coronavirus testing was being conducted door to door.  The American Red Cross noticed widespread reports of this scam across the U.S. and in other countries on social media platforms at the start of the pandemic. In response, it posted advisories on social media throughout the spring to combat misinformation.  ""Please know that the Red Cross is not going to people’s homes to offer coronavirus tests,"" the American Red Cross of the Texas Gulf Coast region tweeted on March 19, 2020. ""If someone comes to your home claiming they work for the Red Cross and that they are authorized to administer coronavirus testing, do not allow them in your home.""  Similar posts were made by several regional chapters of the American Red Cross.  However, these warnings are unwittingly fanning an unverified Internet rumor: there’s no evidence that this door-to-door scam was happening in the first place. This is similar to other false claims that robbers were going door to door in Colorado Springs, Stockton, Calif., and Las Vegas pretending to be COVID-19 testers. Police in those cities said they received no reports of robbers pretending to offer coronavirus testing.  We did not find evidence of law enforcement warning against such COVID-19 tester scams.  We reached out to six other police departments in Tacoma, Wash., Tucson, Ariz.,San Diego, Calif., Santa Monica, Calif., Minneapolis, Minn., and Arlington Country, Va. Not one said they were aware of police reports about fraudulent door-to-door COVID-19 testers. The Facebook post claimed that police and the Red Cross have advised that there are scammers going ""door to door indicating that they are authorized to do testing for Coronavirus."" While the American Red Cross and some police departments in the U.S. have shared warnings against possible con artists pretending to be giving home COVID-19 tests, the post incorrectly portrays the advisory warnings as evidence of these scams.  We found no news coverage of robbers or scammers posing as COVID-19 testers, as the post describes, and nine departments have independently confirmed that no such incidents have also been reported to the police.  Because the claim contains an element of truth but leaves a misleading impression, we rate it Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2021/jul/29/facebook-posts/rumors-scammers-are-posing-door-door-covid-testers/

COVID-19 testing swabs won’t change your DNA, contrary to claim on Facebook
","A video on Facebook is throwing doubt on the safety of COVID-19 tests, claiming the swabs used in the tests are covered in a cancer-causing chemical that will change a person's DNA. In the video shared July 18, a man appears to be at a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site where he’s handed a testing kit by a woman off-camera and he begins to examine the cotton nasal  swab that’s included. The man says the swab contains ""sterile EO,"" and he asks the woman if she knows about the substance. ""Ethylene oxide is the number one ingredient used in antifreeze. For cars and machinery, et cetera,"" the man claims in the one-minute video. ""Ethylene oxide is a mass carcinogen and a mutagen. So it'll give you Hodgkin’s lymphoma and, in females, greatly increase the chances of breast cancer."" The man says ethylene oxide messes with a person’s DNA and it ""literally changes the structure of the building blocks of your own body."" ""You can look it up, that’s going to kill, that’s actually killing people,"" he tells the woman. The video ends with the man declining to take the test and driving away. The video appears to have originated on the social media platform TikTok. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Ethylene oxide is considered a carcinogen and a mutagen (a chemical or physical agent that changes an organism's DNA), and it is used in the production of antifreeze. But the man in the video misrepresents its use in sterilizing medical equipment such as cotton swabs and misleads about its impact on public health. Around 50% of all medical items in the United States are sterilized using ethylene oxide gas, according to the federal Food and Drug Administration.  The gas is used on equipment that would be damaged or harder to sterilize using other techniques such as heating or steaming. Items containing certain plastics, metals, glass and gauze are likely sterilized with the gas, according to the FDA. Following sterilization, items are then aerated so that any remaining ethylene oxide is released. Although short-term exposure to high concentrations of ethylene oxide gas can cause health problems such as headaches, nausea and breathing problems, the trace amounts of gas that may be left on an item like a cotton swab are not enough to trigger any health issues, including cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The residual amount of ethylene oxide is also not enough to cause any mutagenic effects on people; using a treated swab to test for COVID-19 won’t change a person’s DNA. Such damage would occur only after long-term exposure to the gas, the EPA said.  A 2016 study on the effects of ethylene oxide on rayon and cotton swabs used in DNA collection found that the amount of gas remaining on the items was well below any measurable levels three weeks after sterilization. A video shared on Facebook claims that the ethylene oxide used in COVID-19 testing swabs ""literally changes the structure of the building blocks of your own body."" The swabs and many other types of medical equipment are sterilized using ethylene oxide gas. The gas is considered a carcinogen and a mutagen, but any traces of the gas left on a cotton swab after sterilization would be below measurable levels and harmless.  A person wouldn’t have their DNA damaged or develop cancer by using a swab.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/29/facebook-posts/covid-19-testing-swabs-wont-change-your-dna-contra/

US-Mexico border not ‘wide open,’ most people trying to enter US are turned away
","A social media attack on President Joe Biden alleges a gaping contradiction at the Mexico border. ""The COVID delta variant is so deadly Biden is restricting travel for Americans into Mexico but is keeping the border wide open for illegal aliens to walk right into our country,"" the widely shared tweet claims. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Biden administration is limiting Americans’ travel to Mexico, as well as to Canada, in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus. It’s a continuation of a policy established by President Donald Trump. But the Mexico border is not wide open for illegal immigration into the United States. The vast majority of encounters result in U.S. immigration officials turning people away at the border. The element of truth in this claim is that Biden has extended a Trump administration policy, with Mexico, on travel. As the coronavirus outbreak began to take hold, the United States and Mexico announced on March 20, 2020, that they would prohibit for 30 days all ""non-essential"" travel, including travel ""that is considered tourism or recreational in nature,"" across the border. The U.S. and Canada announced the same agreement the same day. Both agreements have been extended monthly under Trump and Biden. In the most recent extension, announced July 21, Homeland Security cited the delta variant, which public health officials believe could be twice as contagious as the original strain of the virus. The idea that the Mexico border is wide open for illegal immigration into the U.S. is wrong. In March, we rated False a claim that the border ""is now open to anyone from anywhere in the world who wishes to enter our country."" And in April, we rated False a claim that the U.S. is locked down and there’s ""a wide open border.""  Thousands of people are arriving at the southern border on a monthly basis. What are known as enforcement encounters at the southern border have risen each month since Biden took office — from 78,442 in January to 188,829 in June, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Encounters data includes people who are placed in immigration proceedings and people who are quickly expelled. Border apprehensions have gone up because people are attempting to cross multiple times and failing, said Nicole Hallett, a professor and director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. ""Apprehensions have increased because of the strict COVID restrictions, not because restrictions have eased."" Most people trying to cross at the border are being turned away, under a March 2020 order by the Trump administration to curb the spread of COVID-19. The Biden administration is still enforcing that policy, although it’s exempting children who arrive alone, as well as some families. Biden is also moving to limit border crossings in another way. Homeland Security announced July 26 that it would quickly turn back migrant families that immigration officials determine do not qualify for asylum during a fast-tracked screening process. ""It is simply not true that the border is ‘wide open’ for ‘illegal aliens’ to cross,"" Hallett said. ""Customs and Border Protection apprehend individuals attempting to cross between border checkpoints. The border is more secure than ever before. Fewer people are able to cross illegally without being apprehended than at any time in the past."" Social media posts claimed that Biden ""is restricting travel for Americans into Mexico, but is keeping the border wide open for illegal aliens to walk right into our country.""

Reports to the CDC’s vaccine early warning system are not ‘vaccine deaths’
","With typical alarm, a website known for false claims about the coronavirus pandemic declared that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduced its count of deaths from COVID-19 vaccines by more than half, from more than 12,000 to more than 6,000.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths. Second, while the CDC did experience a clerical error that was quickly corrected, the error did not amount to a ""quiet deletion of vaccine deaths.""  Gateway Pundit claims that on July 21, the CDC posted 12,313 reported deaths from COVID-19 vaccines on its website but hours later changed the figure to 6,079.  The article alludes to figures from Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), which is run by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.   Anyone can report ""adverse events"" to a vaccine to VAERS — and they do. The reports submitted to the database range from minor side-effects to death. However, these reports do not indicate whether an adverse event is linked to or caused by a vaccine; rather, the reports, which are not verified, are intended as an early warning system to detect possible safety problems.  Nearly 341 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14, 2020, through July 19, according to the CDC. During that period, VAERS received 6,207 reports of death (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.  ""FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause,"" the CDC says. ""Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem.  ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" As for the change in numbers, CDC spokesperson Martha Sharan told PolitiFact that while data was being updated to a page on the CDC website, reports of foreign deaths were accidentally added to the total. The page was later corrected to show the 6,207 reports of death in the U.S. The Gateway Pundit headline said, ""CDC Quietly Deletes 6,000 COVID Vaccine Deaths From Its CDC Website Total in One Day — Caught by Internet Sleuths."" What the website deems a sneaky revelation of twice the amount of vaccine-related deaths in the U.S. was actually a clerical error, the CDC told us. Further, there is no proof that a COVID-19 vaccine played a role in the deaths reported to VAERS following an injection. We rate the post Mostly False.

Jailed defendants in Jan. 6 attack aren’t 'political prisoners.' They’re charged with real crimes.
","Some of the people charged with crimes in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol have been held in solitary confinement while they await trial. An Instagram post mischaracterizes why they were charged and what they are accused of doing. ""FREE JAN 6 POLITICAL PRISONERS,"" the claim begins. ""NON-VIOLENT TRESPASSERS HAVE BEEN IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Versions of the claim have been made on Twitter. The defendants were charged with crimes not because of their political views, but because they allegedly committed violent acts or other crimes during the riot. Most are not in custody while awaiting trial, but some are in jail and some have been held in solitary confinement. Let’s start by dispelling the notion that the armed insurrection was merely a political protest by trespassers. We rated as Pants on Fire a claim that the riot resembled a ""normal tourist visit,"" and we gave a Pants on Fire rating to the claim that it was a ""completely peaceful protest.""  The protesters supporting then-President Donald Trump forced their way through barricades and past law enforcement to breach the building. They smashed windows and broke doors. They ransacked offices. They chanted about the vice president, ""Hang Mike Pence!"" They attacked police officers. They caused the House and Senate to shut down for several hours on the day lawmakers were certifying that Joe Biden won the presidential election. The Justice Department has charged 551 people — 481 men and 70 women — in connection with the siege, according to a database run by the George Washington University Center on Extremism. Charges include obstruction of law enforcement; violence with a deadly weapon; assault; disorderly conduct; and unlawful possession of firearms. The latest arrest, of a 32-year-old Houston man on charges including assaulting an officer, was made July 23. In reviewing court filings, news reports and other information for approximately 430 defendants who had been arrested through June 1, PolitiFact found the key driver behind what happened on Jan. 6 was acceptance of the false narrative that Democrats stole the election with widespread voter fraud. News reports have detailed some of the cases in which suspects have been held in solitary confinement. Politico reported in April that most of the defendants had been released from custody while they await trial, but dozens deemed to be dangerous, flight risks or at high risk of obstructing justice were ordered held without bond. Washington jail officials later decided for safety reasons that all of those defendants would be placed in so-called restrictive housing, which meant 23 hours a day of isolation. In May, The Guardian reported that of the 398 defendants charged as of May 10, at least 330 were listed on the Justice Department website or in federal court records as having been released from custody. New York State resident Edward Jacob Lang, whose charges include assaulting, resisting or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon, was arrested on Jan. 16, largely based on social media posts he made of the Jan. 6 riot.  According to reporting from the Middletown, N.Y., Times Herald-Record, the 26-year-old Lang interrupted a federal judge during a July 16 status hearing on his case, saying that he has been held in solitary confinement for six months, that his treatment is ""inhumane"" and that ""I have been stripped of all human dignity."" The judge did not respond. The newspaper also said that another area defendant, Thomas Webster, was kept alone in his cell for 23 hours a day until being released June 30 to home detention. He was prevented from getting court papers and a computer thumb drive his lawyers mailed him, according to a court filing by his lawyer. Webster, whose charges also include assaulting, resisting or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon, was arrested Feb. 22. Democratic and Republican senators have expressed concerns about the solitary confinement of Jan. 6 defendants. The District of Columbia Department of Corrections would not answer our questions about how many of the defendants have been held in solitary confinement. The department sent a statement that said: ""The safety and security of DOC’s facilities remain our highest priority. It is our mission to protect and treat every resident humanely and respectfully while they are in our care awaiting due process. DOC carries out its mission for every individual regardless of their background and political affiliations."" An Instagram post says people charged in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol are ""political prisoners"" and ""non-violent trespassers"" who have been held in solitary confinement for the past six months. The vast majority of defendants have been released from custody while awaiting trial, but some held in jail have been kept in solitary confinement. The defendants face numerous charges that include violent acts and attacks on officers. While many defendants may have been inspired to participate based on their political beliefs, there is no evidence they are being prosecuted for those beliefs; the charges and court documents show they are being prosecuted for actions that law enforcement officials say violated the law.

A post exaggerates George Floyd’s criminal history
","As memorials to George Floyd are being erected in American cities, so too are social media claims surrounding his past, including one stating that Floyd was involved in multiple violent crimes.  The July 18 Facebook post is a screenshot of a tweet from former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik. It includes a photo of a statue of Floyd being unveiled in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Juneteenth, a celebration of the end of slavery. Alongside the picture is a statement: ""I wonder if the statue has a plaque listing all his good deeds and his contributions to society."" The statement then follows with a list that includes ""3 car thefts"" and ""23 arrests"". Kerik added in his tweet, ""WTF is wrong with our country?""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in May 2020 by a police officer who pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes during an attempted arrest. His death sparked nationwide protests against police abuses and galvanized a movement for racial justice. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder this year. Floyd had a criminal history, but the claims in the Facebook post exaggerate or completely fabricate elements of that record, court documents show.  Attorney Jennifer Lammers, who represents Floyd’s estate, and Floyd family attorney Ben Crump didn’t respond to our requests for comment. PolitiFact also reached out to Kerik regarding his tweet. Neither he nor his team responded to a request for comment. Here is a look at what the post says about Floyd’s criminal background, and what court documents and news reports say. The claim begins its list by stating that Floyd was involved in ""three armed robberies, two violent home invasions, six burglaries and three car thefts."" That’s exaggerated. According to reports from The Washington Post and the Houston Chronicle that detail Floyd’s life, he and his family moved from North Carolina to Houston when he was a young child, and he spent most of his life there. He was arrested nine times there, according to public records accessible in the Office of the Harris County Clerk’s database — not 23 times as the claim states.  List of Floyd's charges, Office of Harris County District Clerk Floyd was arrested twice for theft charges: One was a theft of $50 to $500, and the other is listed as a ""theft from person,"" which was a part of a plea deal to lessen the charge from aggravated robbery. Neither case’s charging documents state that a car was stolen. Floyd was arrested again in 2007, this time for an aggravated robbery in which he and five other men broke into the apartment of a woman named Aracely Henriquez to find drugs and money, according to court documents. PolitiFact previously reported on a similar claim that involved this case: Floyd pushed a pistol against Henriquez’s abdomen before searching her house. There is no evidence in court documents that she was pregnant, as the Facebook post claims. Court records list only this home invasion charge. The post claims Floyd was involved in multiple illegal trespasses, cocaine and alcohol addiction, drug dealing and beating four victims ""senseless.""  Floyd was arrested once for illegal trespass on the property of another person. Another unrelated charge was for failure to identify himself to a police officer. We found no evidence in court documents that Floyd beat four people. Four of Floyd’s nine arrests were for drug possession or distribution of cocaine. Floyd dealt with a years-long drug addiction. He took part in a 90-day rehabilitation program in Minneapolis in 2017, according to a report in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.  During a 2019 traffic stop, police found that he had ingested and was in possession of pills. Police did not charge Floyd during the 2019 traffic stop. Body-camera video of the incident was released publicly as evidence during Chauvin’s murder trial. Floyd’s girlfriend Courtney Ross testified in court about their addictions to opiates.  Minnesota court records show that Floyd was involved in other traffic violations while in Minneapolis, including not having his driver’s license on hand during a stop. These did not involve arrests. In one case, the court ordered him to do two days of community service. As for the nine Harris County criminal charges, Floyd pleaded guilty to seven of them, including a majority of the drug charges, the aggravated robbery and one theft charge. He pleaded no contest to two others. In total, Floyd served eight years and nearly eight months in state jail, county jail and prison for his actions. A Facebook post claims that Floyd’s criminal history involved 23 arrests, three car thefts and many violent crimes. Court documents show that Floyd was arrested nine times for charges including four charges of drug possession and distribution, two theft charges, one illegal trespass, one charge of failure to identify to a police officer and one aggravated robbery.  The claim overstates the number and severity of these charges and includes crimes Floyd wasn’t charged with, including beating four victims and three car thefts. Court documents and reports contain no evidence of such charges. We rate this claim False.

What the post suggests is hype were numerous news stories about how hard Florida is being hit.  On the same day of the post, the Wall Street Journal reported that Florida is recording more COVID-19 cases than any other state, with hospitalizations in some areas rising at the fastest rate since the start of the pandemic.  The next day, the Associated Press reported that Florida accounted for one-fifth of the nation’s new infections last week, more than any other state. Florida news media have covered the surge, including a detection of a variant of the virus, which originated from Colombia.  Florida reported 73,199 coronavirus cases over the seven-day period from July 16 to July 22, according to the Tampa Bay Times. That’s 60% more weekly cases than the last reporting period and three times higher than the number of cases reported two weeks earlier, with infections reaching a rate not seen since Feb. 5.

As of July 27, there were 397,718 new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. in the last week, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 22% — 87,470 — were in Florida. Florida had 407.3 cases per 100,000 people as of July 27, the second-highest rate, behind Louisiana’s 441. Over the same time period, Florida recorded 370 COVID-19 deaths, highest among the states. Texas was second, with 201. Florida’s 1.7 deaths per 100,000 people meant it tied for third-highest among the states. Nevada was highest at 2.5.  The surge has occurred despite the fact that Florida is relatively well vaccinated. According to Mayo Clinic, 56.7% of Florida’s 21 million residents have received at least one dose, which puts Florida just under the middle of the pack among states; and 48.5% are fully vaccinated. Sonja Rasmussen, a professor in epidemiology at the University of Florida, said that overall vaccination rates don’t take into account pockets of the state that have low vaccination levels and are therefore susceptible to fast outbreaks that can spread. Jason Salemi, professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida, said four main factors explain the surge:  the much higher infectiousness of the delta variant of the coronavirus; 8 million age-eligible Floridians not having been vaccinated;  people using fewer prevention measures such as mask wearing; and hot weather driving people indoors, where it’s easier to spread the virus. Mary Jo Trepka, chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Florida International University, added that a lower rate of vaccination among people under age 65 is a problem, because they tend to interact with more people. ""People want this to be over, but just because you want it to be over doesn’t mean it’s over,"" Trepka said. Christina Pushaw, the press secretary for Gov. Ron DeSantis, was asked by the Tallahassee Democrat whether DeSantis would declare a state of emergency, as he did when COVID-19 emerged in Florida in March 2020. She said: ""No, there are no plans for a new state of emergency regarding COVID. What, concretely, do you believe a state of emergency would accomplish that cannot be accomplished without a state of emergency?"" A Facebook post claims that Florida’s COVID-19 numbers are ""hype"" and a ""lie."" Statistics prove that claim wrong. Florida is reporting the second-highest new case numbers in the nation, and the highest number of deaths.  We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

No evidence for viral claim that ‘22 million illegal aliens’ are ‘voting illegally’
","Social media users on Facebook and Instagram are sharing a years-old image that wrongly claims 22 million people are not only living in the U.S. illegally, but voting in elections. ""I’ll tell you what a constitutional crisis is: 22 million illegal aliens living in America and using benefits they never contributed to and voting illegally,"" the text over the image says. The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The image, which appeared on Facebook as early as April 2019, is circulating as supporters of former President Donald Trump continue to promote the false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen from him. But the claims in the image have always been inaccurate. There is no evidence that 22 million immigrants regularly vote in American elections despite living in the country without legal permission, or that they did so in 2020. In fact, it’s not clear that there are even that many people living in the country illegally to begin with. ""There is no evidence that there are 22 million immigrants in the U.S. voting illegally, either in 2020 or at any time,"" said Lorraine Minnite, an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers University in Camden. ""The claim is preposterous.""  A screenshot shows the viral image circulating on Facebook and Instagram as it appeared July 27, 2021. President Joe Biden won more votes than Trump in what local, state and federal officials affirmed was a free and fair election absent of the widespread fraud Trump claimed.  Judges across the country rejected dozens of lawsuits seeking to overturn the election, in many cases because the allegations of fraud came without the proof needed to back them up. The image claiming 22 million immigrants are living and voting illegally similarly lacks proof.  ""One would think that such claims of historic subversion in our democracy would be backed up by the receipts to prove them,"" said Matthew Weil, director of the elections project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud at any level.""  Federal law requires citizenship to vote in national elections, and would-be voters sign a form attesting under penalty of perjury that they are citizens when they register to do so. As PolitiFact has reported, states can check various databases to verify voters’ citizenship status. ""Election officials spend the weeks before and after Election Day constantly reconciling voter rolls and ballot totals to ensure that only eligible Americans cast ballots,"" Weil said. He added that cases of fraudulent voting are rare in any year and often the result of misunderstandings. Minnite, who wrote a book about ""The Myth of Voter Fraud,"" said the most common problem she has seen in her research on the issue is noncitizens getting accidentally registered to vote when they go to the DMV. But the number of people who fall into this category is ""miniscule,"" she said. In previous years, PolitiFact fact-checked several similar claims from Trump and others — all inaccurate — about immigrants voting illegally in the 2008, 2016 and 2018 elections.  Our reporting pointed to research from several organizations that found voter fraud among noncitizens is not widespread. Experts also told us at the time that fraud on the scale of millions would require months of coordination going undetected by elections officials.  For there to be ""22 million"" immigrants unlawfully in the U.S. and ""voting illegally,"" as the latest viral image now claims, there would also need to be that many people in the country illegally.  And each and every one of them would have to be casting a ballot. But the one study from 2018 that estimated the population here illegally was around 22.1 million has been criticized by demographers and immigration experts, who said it’s not grounded in empirical research about illegal immigration patterns and overestimates migration from Mexico, among other things, as PolitiFact reported. The Homeland Security Department, Pew Research Center, Center for Migration Studies of New York and Migration Policy Institute have all settled on much lower estimates. ""In each case, the organizations have individually developed estimates within a pretty tight range of about 10.5 million to 11.5 million unauthorized immigrants overall in the United States,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, communications director for the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank. Finally, immigrant adults living in the country illegally are ineligible for nearly all federal public benefits, with few exceptions, Mittelstadt said. That’s despite the fact that some pay many forms of taxes, including state and local sales taxes and property taxes. A viral image says there are ""22 million illegal aliens living in America and ... voting illegally."" That’s not true. Many reliable entities, including the Homeland Security Department and the Pew Research Center, estimate that there are closer to 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. There’s no evidence that 22 million are regularly voting illegally or did so in 2020.

Video uses misleading labels to suggest that COVID-19 vaccinations were faked
","The December 2020 rollout of COVID-19 vaccines prompted campaigns in which public officials and health care workers got their shots in front of TV cameras to help promote vaccination.  These campaigns also ushered in a new wave of misinformation, including false claims about ""disappearing needles"" and staged public vaccinations. Months after they were debunked, some of the same claims are still making the rounds. A July 19 Facebook post — with the caption ""Watch carefully.... so you think you haven't been brainwashed"" — includes a video montage that suggests people who got COVID-19 shots while on camera, including Vice President Kamala Harris, were faking being vaccinated.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Of six vaccinations shown in the montage, at least five are depicted in false or misleading ways; the montage incorporates one claim that first circulated and was debunked in December 2020.  The first segment of the video shows Christine Elliott, minister of health for the Canadian province of Ontario, getting a shot. However, the footage is from October 2019 when Elliott received a routine flu vaccine, which was documented at that time in a Facebook post and video from a local TV station.  The second segment in the Facebook video purports to depict Israeli politician Beni Ben Muvchar receiving a vaccine in December 2020. The video zooms in on the syringe being used, which appears to have no needle, and a Spanish-language text overlay says, ""does not have a needle, isn’t loaded"" and ""she doesn’t push the plunger."" Muvchar, in fact, did not receive a vaccine at that time. The clip of Muvchar is from a short promotional video intended to encourage others to get vaccinated, and ""for the purposes of the video, a nurse pretends to give (Muvchar) the vaccine,"" according to The Observers/France 24.  The video had 2.8 million views on Facebook and was shared more than 70,000 times. Because of the furor over the staged demonstration, Muvchar posted a different video on Facebook of his actual vaccination.  For the third segment, about five seconds long, we were unable to identify the person being vaccinated or the setting.  The fourth segment in the Facebook video shows a health care worker administering a vaccine, and after the syringe is removed from the patient’s arm, the needle is no longer visible. A Spanish-language text overlay on the Facebook video says, ""Now you see the needle ... and now you don’t."" The footage was from a real news story by BBC News, but the claim about the disappearing needles was debunked by the media outlet in December 2020. The syringe in the footage is a safety syringe, ""in which the needle retracts into the body of the device after use,"" BBC News reported.  The fifth segment shows a nurse getting the shot at University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, and the video zooms in on the syringe, which appeared to have had the plunger already depressed. TV station KFOX14 said the footage was captured by its photojournalist during a public vaccination event, and the empty syringe appears to have been a mistake. The medical center said the nurse was vaccinated again properly after the center was alerted about it. The TV station reviewed footage of other nurses being vaccinated at the same event and did not see the same issue in any other case.  The final segment in the Facebook video shows then-Vice President-elect Harris being vaccinated. The video zooms in on the nurse pushing the syringe against the arm of the chair where Harris is seated. Reuters reported that the nurse was using the arm rest to snap the cap back onto the syringe. The nurse wasn’t able to use her other hand to do this because it was on Harris’ arm. Reuters reported that the exposed needle was visible in videos of Harris’ vaccination and that media photos clearly show the needle in her arm. A Facebook post includes a video montage that purports to show that people who got COVID-19 shots while on camera, including Harris, were faking being vaccinated.  The video clips included in the montage are of real events, but they are depicted and labeled in misleading ways. One of the video segments shows a flu shot that was administered in 2019, and another shows a staged promotional event. Other parts of the video mischaracterize the type of medical equipment used or mistakes that occurred during vaccinations and were later corrected.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/27/facebook-posts/video-suggesting-covid-19-vaccinations-were-faked-/

Here’s why experts say people who had COVID-19 should be vaccinated
","As the U.S. tries to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates, skeptics on social media are challenging the efficacy of vaccines for people who were previously infected by the virus. Dr. Joseph Mercola, an osteopathic physician identified as a top spreader of anti-vaccine misinformation on Facebook, dismissed the need for vaccination in people who have had COVID-19. ""It makes no sense to require vaccinations for the previously infected,"" Mercola wrote in a post on his Facebook page. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Mercola’s post responded to a tweet criticizing universities that are requiring vaccination, even for people who have recovered from COVID-19. The American College Health Association has recommended COVID-19 vaccination requirements for all on-campus college students this fall. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, 602 institutions had some type of vaccination requirement, as of July 26. For this fact check, we wanted to know if medical experts agreed with Mercola’s claim that a prior COVID-19 diagnosis means you shouldn’t need to get vaccinated. We should note that the science regarding how much protection a natural infection offers compared with a vaccine is still developing. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends COVID-19 vaccines for people 12 and older, even if they have been infected before. ""That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19,"" the CDC website says.  In an emailed statement to PolitiFact, Mercola said, ""Natural immunity induces lasting antibody protection, and individuals who have had an SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from a COVID-19 vaccination."" His response included a link to a Cleveland Clinic study that examined 2,579 people previously infected with COVID-19 — including 1,359 who were not vaccinated — and found that none were re-infected over a period of five months. The study concluded that individuals who were previously infected were unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination and that the vaccine could be prioritized for people who have been uninfected. This study, which PolitiFact explored in June, has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal. In a June 9 statement about the study, the Cleveland Clinic said that their results ""could help guide vaccination efforts should there be a shortage of vaccine supply and in countries where vaccine supply is limited."" ""We do not know how long the immune system will protect itself against re-infection after COVID-19,"" the statement said. ""It is safe to receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if you have previously tested positive, and we recommend all those who are eligible receive it."" Mercola also cited two other studies to back his claim that vaccination is unnecessary for someone who has already had COVID-19. We reached out to an author of each of these studies to see what they thought about Mercola’s use of their respective findings. Dr. Ali Ellebedy’s study measured the decline of bone marrow plasma cells, an important source of antibodies, in people previously infected with COVID-19. The study found that the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ""declined rapidly in the first 4 months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7 months, remaining detectable at least 11 months after infection."" Ellebedy said he encourages vaccination even if someone has been previously infected, and that his study should not be cited as a reason for a previously infected person to not get vaccinated. ""Our study shows that mild SARS-CoV-2 infection induces persistent immune molecules that are directed against the virus but does not address whether these levels of immunity can actually protect against infection,"" Ellebedy said. ""Also, it is important to remember that not all infected people mount a robust immune response, so it is wrong to generalize and say ‘if you are infected, you are protected.’"" The other study looked at whether the immune systems of people previously infected with the virus remembered contracting COVID-19. In a March 25 YouTube video sent to PolitiFact, co-author Dr. Shane Crotty said that with the laboratory measurements his team took, scientists can make some useful inferences, ""but they don’t directly show protection."" ""The vaccines are eliciting even more immunity than natural infection,"" Crotty said. He also reiterated Ellebedy’s point that the immune response to a natural COVID-19 infection can vary widely from person to person. Crotty said that these two factors have contributed to the public health recommendation of still getting vaccinated if you’ve been infected, and that he would get vaccinated if had COVID-19. A natural infection could probably protect against hospitalization and death from a subsequent infection, possibly up to a few years, but it might not protect someone from a newer strain of the virus, said Dr. Paul Offit, chair of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. ""Your natural infection will provide protection against whatever (strain) you were naturally infected with, but now there's a different virus circulating,"" Offit said. ""So by getting a vaccine, you'll have a broader immune response to a more diverse population of SARS-CoV-2 viruses."" Offit also pointed out that three peer-reviewed and published studies suggest that a single dose of an mRNA vaccine (such as ones from Pfizer or Moderna) gives comparable protection against COVID-19 in a previously infected person as it does in someone who got both doses. Virologist Dr. Sabra Klein, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in a May interview published by Johns Hopkins University that vaccines provide better protection for people who have previously been infected. ""It gives them a strong, lasting immunity boost,"" Klein said. ""After receiving the first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, they have immunity levels comparable to those of uninfected people who have received their second dose."" Offit said that in light of these studies, one mRNA shot could suffice in people who have been previously infected. ""There is no downside to vaccinating. All vaccination does is broaden and lengthen your immunity,"" Offit said. Additionally, the CDC has evidence that people who are fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine are less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others than unvaccinated people. This means that in the rare chance a person does get reinfected, they would likely have a lower chance of spreading the virus.  Mercola wrote, ""It makes no sense to require vaccinations for the previously infected."" Experts are unsure exactly how long someone is protected against COVID-19 after they have been infected. The CDC says vaccination is a more effective way of building protection against the virus, including variants. The authors of the studies Mercola cited recommended that people who were previously infected with COVID-19 still get vaccinated. They say vaccination does make sense, because everyone can have varying degrees of immunity and it is unclear how long natural immunity lasts.
