Marco Rubio says surface temperatures on Earth 'have stabilized'
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been attracting a lot of attention recently for expressing skepticism about how much humans contribute to global warming and what policy approaches the United States should take. During a May 20, 2014, interview, Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly asked Rubio, ""Now, you said (a) flat-out bold and fresh statement that you don't believe the scientists on global warming. Are you going up against these people?"" Rubio responded, ""No, here's the point. First of all, I have never denied the climate is changing. That shouldn't surprise us. The climate is always changing. The second point on the science is, the left loves to go around saying there is a consensus, there is a consensus. There is a majority of scientists that say that global carbon emissions by humans causes some changes in the climate. What there is no consensus on and (what) they conveniently ignore is there is no consensus on the sensitivity of the climate. How much is it changing and how much of it is directly attributable to human carbon emission? There is no consensus on that, which is why the models vary so greatly, which is why, despite 17 years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface temperatures (on) the earth have stabilized."" We wondered whether Rubio was accurate when he said that surface temperatures on Earth ""have stabilized."" Rubio’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story. But in interviews with nearly a dozen scientists, we received a nuanced assessment of his remark. On the one hand, we found most accepting Rubio’s starting point -- that surface temperatures on earth, which were once rising rapidly, have ""paused"" their increase over the past 16 or 17 years. On the other hand, most of the scientists we checked with took exception to his use of the word ""stabilized"" to describe this phenomenon, saying the ""pause"" is temporary. While ""stabilized"" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of it, the reality, scientists say, is that temperatures will rise again, sooner or later. ""Stabilized"" is ""a very poor word to use,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Rubio’s word choice ""has no merit,"" agreed Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Reto Ruedy, a climate specialist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, concurred, saying that the claim of stabilization had ""no legitimacy."" Even Paul C. ""Chip"" Knappenberger, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said Rubio had gone too far by saying the situation had ""stabilized."" While global warming ""certainly has slowed down considerably"" over the past 16 or 17 years, Knappenberger said confirmation that the situation has ""stabilized"" would take ""another 10 to 20 years."" ""The pace will probably pick back up again at sometime in the future,"" Knappenberger said. ""But when that will be, or what the new pace will be, are far from scientifically agreed upon characteristics."" A closer look at the recent past Climate-change skeptics have made the pause a cornerstone of their argument that concern about global warming is overblown. And at least on the existence of a pause, the statistics are on their side. An interactive chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows land and ocean surface temperatures going back to the 1800s. While there’s been some variation in surface temperatures since 1998, it has remained within a relatively narrow band, which contrasts with the rapid rise during the decades that preceded it. (The strongest evidence of a pause is for the past 16 years, but we won’t quibble with Rubio’s use of the 17-year time frame.) Scientists also said that Rubio is correct to point to the uncertainty inherent in climate models. Mainstream climate scientists are taking the pause seriously. As PolitiFact Rhode Island has noted, the United Kingdom’s weather office has begun referring to the last 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" It’s worth noting that even at the level of the ""pause,"" temperatures are still historically high. As we’ve previously noted, 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years, according to NASA. But importantly, most scientists do not expect the pause to continue indefinitely. The United Kingdom office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Judith Curry, who chairs the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology -- and who believes climate change is happening but has put more emphasis on the scientific uncertainties than other scientists -- said reasonable people can disagree with how quickly the temperature rise will begin and how far it will go. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body that has been among the most prominent voices raising the specter of significant impacts from climate change, said it ""expects the temperatures to resume increasing soon, whereas certain scientists, including myself, expect the current pause in surface temperatures to continue for another decade or two,"" Curry said. We couldn’t find any experts who believe temperatures have ""stabilized"" in the sense of settling down into a consistent pattern indefinitely. ""Increases in Earth's temperature have indeed slowed, but have certainly not stabilized,"" said Rob Jackson, an earth sciences professor at Stanford University. ""Every year is now what would have been a record year in the 1990s, and the last decade was the warmest in the modern record."" Rubio’s statement ""is misleading, because it implies that the climate has reached a balance or equilibrium, so that global temperatures will not rise in the future,"" agreed Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. ""However, the earth's climate has not stabilized. In particular, the flow of energy into and out of the planet is not in balance. It is gaining more energy than it is losing, due to increased greenhouse gases, and therefore future warming is unavoidable."" Explaining the paradox of the 'pause' The central paradox Rubio points out -- an increase in carbon dioxide emissions without a commensurate rise in surface temperatures -- has prompted several theories to explain it. One reason is that, over the long term, data always fluctuates somewhat. ""The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise,"" but superimposed on this general trend are ""periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling,"" said Serreze of the University of Colorado-Boulder. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, ""the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming."" Some experts add that starting the count in 1998 exaggerates the ""pause,"" since that was an unusually strong ""El Nino"" year. El Nino is an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally, including raising global temperatures by releasing ""tremendous amounts of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere,"" said Jennifer Francis, a research professor at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University. ""To look at the trend of a relatively short period that started out with an extraordinary El Nino event causing a huge temperature spike is a cheap device,"" said Reto Ruedy of NASA’s Goddard Institute. The physical explanation gaining the most traction is that ""the oceans have accumulated most of the heat from human-induced global warming,"" said Harold Wanless, University of Miami geological sciences professor. One recent paper found that in one part of the Pacific, middle-depth temperatures have been rising 15 times faster over the past six decades than at any other time over the past 10,000 years. Other papers have found similar evidence. Basic physics teaches that water has an immense ability to take in and hold heat -- but that same heat will eventually be released. ""The trapped heat is still in the system, and it will be released into the atmosphere when the recent pattern of Pacific Ocean temperatures switches back to its warmer phase,"" said Francis of Rutgers. Other factors may also be playing a role in the ""pause,"" said Reilly of MIT. In addition to an absence of strong El Nino events since 1998, Reilly said, the eruption of some moderate volcanoes may have produced cooling effects that counteracted some of the heating. And there’s evidence that the long-term data sets for temperature have under-recorded Arctic regions where temperatures have been rising most rapidly. ""So, several factors that are known sources of variability in the climate system all, by coincidence, contributed to a cooling trend over the period,"" Reilly said. This suggests that global warming ""was occurring -- it's just that the added warmth was going into the ocean.  It’s unlikely that all of these coincidences will continue, or continue to offset warming."" Our ruling Rubio said that ""surface temperatures in the earth have stabilized."" He has a point that over roughly the past decade and a half, global surface temperatures have ""paused,"" particularly compared to their rapid rise in previous decades. But scientists we interviewed agreed that the use of the word ""stabilized"" represents an unjustified leap from the data, since ""stabilized"" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of climate change. At the very least, the uncertainty inherent in climate forecasting makes such a claim of ""stabilization"" premature. More likely, the evidence suggests that the ""pause"" in global surface temperatures is temporary, with temperatures poised to rise once the oceans start releasing more heat, such as during an El Nino event. It’s not clear when temperatures will rise again, but few scientists doubt that temperatures will rise again at some point. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly False.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Valarie Wilson']","
Georgia superintendent candidate criticizes opponent for past votes
","Educators for several years have lamented state budget cuts to public schools. That’s why it’s likely no surprise that Valarie Wilson, a candidate for state school superintendent, is trying to make political hay of the fact that her opponent and fellow Democrat Alisha Thomas Morgan had a hand in those cuts. In a recent campaign flier, Wilson accused Morgan, her July runoff opponent, of, among other things, voting to slash funding in 2010 for programs to help disabled preschoolers and other special needs students. We wondered whether that was true and decided to crank up the Truth-O-Meter. Wilson, a former chairwoman of the Decatur school board, points out that candidate Morgan touts her role on the House Appropriations education subcommittee and the leverage it gave her. ""I am not a legislator,"" Wilson said. ""However, I believe that every vote cast or decision made reflects priorities and values."" We scoured state budget documents and were able to confirm that Wilson is technically right. Morgan, a member of the Georgia House since 2003, voted in favor of an amended 2010 state budget that included cuts to the program for disabled preschoolers, as well to a program giving scholarships to special needs students who want to attend private schools. (The amended budget -- House Bill 947 -- passed in 2010, with 122 yes votes, including Morgan’s, and 44 no votes, so an argument could be made that the budget would have passed without Morgan’s vote.) But there’s more to the story. First of all, these cuts were made when Georgia and the nation were in the aftermath of what’s come to be known as the Great Recession. In January 2010, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue was asking lawmakers -- Morgan included --  to cut $1.2 billion out of a budget that had already been in place for six months. Revenue was bleak -- down $136 million, or 8.7 percent, just for that month. The program to help disabled 3- and 4-year-olds be better prepared for school didn’t escape the cutting. Neither did the special needs scholarship program. The $29 million budget for the preschool disabled program was cut about $2 million. About $1 million of that came from furloughing employees and cuts to employer insurance premiums  --- something that was done across all of state government. Morgan’s campaign points out that the preschool budget was cut by a smaller percentage, nearly 6.9 percent, than most departments. Records show state spending to pre-school was cut less than many departments, such as Agriculture, Economic Development, Natural Resources and the Regents System. Funding for the private school scholarships was cut $4 million, and officials in the House Budget Office say that was based strictly on the state’s education funding formula. It’s true that the state budget can, in theory, be amended when it hits the floor of either the House or Senate. Rule 108.3 spells out the protocol in the House. ""No amendment to any appropriations bill shall be in order if the amendment has the effect of both reducing one appropriation and either increasing another appropriation or adding a new appropriation. No amendment to any appropriations bill increasing any appropriation or adding a new appropriation shall be in order unless there has previously been adopted an amendment reducing some other appropriation so as to make funds available for such new or increased appropriation; and no amendment to any appropriations bill shall be in order which would cause the bill to violate the balanced budget requirements of the Constitution."" Longtime observers say floor amendments to the budget have been tried a few times, but rarely. Michael Brewer, Morgan’s deputy campaign manager, said the claims in Wilson’s flier are ""intellectually disingenuous, at best."" They overlook the tough economic times and the state’s obligation to balance its budget and pay its bills, he said. ""Tough choices were made to tighten the state’s belt, so to speak, without raising taxes on Georgia families during the difficult economic recession,"" Brewer said. ""Cuts were made across the board to every state agency and department, and legislators did everything they could to reduce and stymie those cuts to education."" In the 2014 state budget approved by lawmakers last year, funding for the preschool disabled program was back to $29 million, the amount it was before the 2010 midyear cuts, he pointed out. Morgan also voted in favor of that budget. In summary, Wilson is correct that Morgan voted for an amended state budget for 2010 that included cuts to the preschool disabled program and a scholarship program for special needs students. But a lot of context is needed to understand the claim. The state was in economic hard times in 2010, and cuts were being ordered across all state agencies, with sign-off from a majority of the General Assembly, not just Morgan. These programs represent a small fraction of the state’s multibillion-dollar annual budget. PolitiFact has encountered many cases where candidates accuse elected officials of supporting cuts without noting that these votes were parts of larger budget decisions. Wilson’s attack against Morgan omits key context. It is accurate but misleading.   We rate the statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A51A80>],/factchecks/2014/may/27/valarie-wilson/georgia-superintendent-candidate-criticizes-oppone/
"['Environment', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry right on cuts in air pollutants, but overlooks facets
","Gov. Rick Perry visited a familiar boast about the clearing skies of Texas in a May 19, 2014, letter to President Barack Obama that may have tested possible themes of another gubernatorial run for president. Saying Texas employs an ""all-of-the-above energy strategy"" tapping fossil fuels plus solar, biofuel and wind resources, Perry wrote: ""Even as our population has grown by more than 5 million since 2000, we've led the U.S. energy revolution while protecting our environment and reducing harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average."" 62, 23, 12 — sounds like a quarterback’s call before the snap. We were curious about his numbers. Is Perry right about the pollution reductions as well as the cuts outpacing decreases nationally? A 2010 fact check Perry made a similar claim in June 2010, saying in a press release the ""Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions."" He’d earlier cited the same statistic in a letter to Obama. Half True, we found then. Perry accurately recapped improvements in ozone levels. But as for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic included only one NOx source — industrial — which he did not note. Notably, nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Also, whether state government merited credit for the improvements struck us as worthy of pause. Even if the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts  — in particular, vehicle emission regulations  — were a key factor. Significantly, too, the state's ozone-related programs existed to help Texas comply with federal expectations. As noted then, a goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what the Environmental Protection Agency calls ""commonly found air pollutants."" Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozone, the primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in ""nonattainment."" Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Figures hold up As in 2010, we asked David T. Allen, a University of Texas professor of chemical engineering, about Perry’s statement. By email, Allen noted that per figures posted online by the TCEQ, Perry’s analysis holds up. Allen also pointed out an EPA web page indicating that nationally ozone levels in 2012 were down 9 percent compared to 2000 with NOx levels down 29 to 50 percent, depending on the measurement applied. Separately by email, commission spokesman Terry Clawson sent us a spreadsheet he described as the basis of the charts. Clawson said the data came from the EPA. Let’s recap the charted changes in ozone, then NOx. Ozone down 23 percent According to a commission chart on a web page last updated April 17, 2014, ozone in Texas decreased 23 percent from 2000 through 2012, as Perry said. (The comparisons reflect what officials call ""fourth-high"" ozone readings. Clawson emailed us this technical explanation.) A headline on the chart says the ozone decrease for the other 49 states averaged 11 percent. Texas ran 12 percentage points ahead of that. The chart shows ozone decreasing in all but a few states--Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Hawaii and Alaska--with the drop in Texas bested only by Tennessee, California and Georgia.  Source: Web page, ""Air Quality Successes - Criteria Pollutants,"" Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) NOx from industrial sources down 62.5 percent In the period, Allen emailed, industrial emissions of NOx (not including motor vehicles) in Texas dropped 62.5 percent. He pointed out a commission chart indicating that industrial NOx emissions of more than 300,000 xx tons in 2011 compared to a shade less than 800,000 xx tons per year in 2000, which works out to a 62.5 percent reduction, as Perry said.  Source: Web page, ""Air Quality Successes - Emissions Inventory,"" Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, last updated April 17, 2014 (accessed May 21, 2014) Sierra Club stresses  federal role For another perspective, we turned to Neil Carman of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. By phone, Carman called Perry’s figures accurate though he suggested the cited reductions occurred mainly thanks to federal laws and enforcement. Carman, director of the club’s Clean Air program, said the federal government still considers the multi-county Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas as not attaining minimum ozone standards. He pointed out a Sierra Club press release stating the club on May 20, 2014, filed suit against the EPA for failing to classify Dallas-Fort Worth as having a ""severe"" ozone problem, an action that would have required polluters to clean the air, the press release says. By email, Carman said the governor's claim misleads by ""lumping together Texas' ozone woes in Houston and"" Dallas-Fort Worth ""with all the other ozone areas in the nation, including areas that have minimal or no problems."" A ""comparison to other states with few ozone problems is roughly analogous to comparing a driver who gets 30 speeding tickets a year and reduces it by 50% over ten years to 15 per year,"" Carman said, ""while a second driver only had 3 tickets and reduces it by 33% to 2 tickets per year. The first driver had the greatest (percentage) reduction at 50% and the greatest volume reduction but also had the worst speeding record."" Earlier, Clawson indicated the gains noted by Perry weren’t entirely due to federal oversight. By email,  he noted a 1999 Texas law that required power plants to reduce NOx emissions, also saying other state laws enacted since 2000 stressed energy efficiency, reductions in pollution and renewable energy sources like wind power. Clawson, asked about the bulk of NOx pollution coming from vehicles and non-industrial sources, which Perry’s statement did not take up, said NOx emissions from non-industrial sources in Texas in 2011 were 42 percent less than what such sources emitted in 1999. Our ruling Perry said that since 2000, Texas has reduced ""harmful pollutants in the air like nitrogen oxide by 62.5 percent, and ozone by 23 percent — a reduction that is 12 percent greater than the national average."" Those figures are accurate, but the claim (like Perry’s 2010 statement) takes into account only one NOx source — industrial — which it failed to note. Nearly three-quarters of NOx emissions come from other sources. Perry’s declaration also didn't reflect on federal laws and oversight that figure into pollution reductions. Texas didn’t make the gains in isolation. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Providence Mayor Angel Taveras says he has turned Providence's $110 million deficit into a $1.6 million surplus
","After Angel Taveras was sworn in as mayor of Providence on Jan. 3, 2011, he discovered that the city was facing big financial problems. Now that the Democrat is running for governor, he is boasting about how he brought that debt under control. ""I'm proud of my record as mayor, which includes turning a $110 million deficit into a $1.6 million surplus for our city,"" he said in a May 12, 2014, fundraising letter. That's a lot of money saved in a city where the 2014 budget is $662 million. We know that the Taveras administration found substantial savings by getting concessions from the city's unions, closing some schools, making other cutbacks, and raising revenue through additional taxes, including increased payments from tax-exempt institutions. But was the city really $110 million in the red and is it now $1.6 million in the black? Not exactly. During his budget address on April 29, 2014, Taveras was more precise: ""Last year, we finally eliminated the $110 million structural deficit and ended the year with a $1.6 million surplus,"" he said. The key word here is ""structural,"" and we suspect that most people don't even know what a ""structural deficit"" is. When cities and towns draft budgets and get audited, the term is usually nowhere to be found. You have a ""structural deficit"" if you're going to lose money unless you increase your revenue or cut your spending, regardless of whether the economy is doing well or not, said Edward M. Mazze, former dean and current professor of business at the University of Rhode Island In other words, if the tally of your projected expenses for the coming year -- food, electricity, mortgage, and the rest -- comes to $50,000 and your projected income is only $40,000 a year, you have a structural deficit of $10,000. In January 2011, after it appeared the city was spending far more money than it was taking in, Taveras commissioned a report from a team of outside experts which concluded that, unless things changed, Providence would accumulate $109.9 million in new debt during the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the first full fiscal year of the Taveras administration. That was its projected structural deficit for the year. The actual deficit for that year never got that high because his administration, in conjunction with the city's unions, moved quickly to bring down costs and raise revenue. (The structural deficit for the previous fiscal year, which began when David Cicilline was mayor, was estimated to be $69.6 million.) How big did the actual deficit get under the Taveras administration? The best numbers come from the city's annual audit. According to the report from the period ending June 30, 2012, the accumulated deficit from that year, combined with previous years, had grown to $11.4 million. That's a far cry from the $110 million deficit Taveras talks about in his fundraising letter. And was there really a $1.6-million surplus? Yes. It was in the 2013 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2013. But because the debt, technically known as cumulative deficit, was so large to start with, the extra $1.6 million simply trimmed the debt to $9.8 million. The cumulative deficit for the current fiscal year won't be released until December. The city is hoping to shrink it by another million dollars. We asked city finance officials how they know that the $110 million structural deficit estimate was reasonable at the time. The city’s Administration Director, Michael D’Amico, said $110 million in changes were made based on the $110 million projection. If the projection had been inaccurate, the city would have seen a huge surplus, which it didn't. When we asked the Taveras campaign why the term ""structural deficit"" was not used in the letter, spokeswoman Dawn Bergantino said ""there wasn't any motive for not using the term in that email."" ""We are pretty consistent in using the term 'structural deficit,' but in this instance we just didn't,"" she said. ""No, the city didn't end up $110 million in the red. But had he not taken action to close that deficit, it would have."" Our ruling In a fundraising letter, Angel Taveras said he turned ""a $110 million deficit into a $1.6 million surplus for our city."" The average reader would get the impression that the city was $110 million in debt but now has an extra $1.6 million. The threat of a $110 million deficit was real, but the city's actual debt never accumulated to anything close to that amount. To their credit, Taveras, his staff and the city's unions engineered a major turnaround in the city's finances that prevented that from happening. The $1.6 million surplus was also real, but only for that year. And by then the city was so deep in debt, its general fund was still $9.8 million in the hole. And if the city hits its target this year, it will still be roughly $8.8 million in the red when the fiscal year ends June 30. Although Taveras accurately characterized the potential deficit in his budget speech, the campaign letter that initially caught our attention gives the false impression that (a.) the city was $110 million in debt when it wasn't and (b.) it's not in debt anymore, which it is. The campaign fundraising letter oversimplifies and overreaches to the point of being deceptive. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

"['Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Shrub found in wild during California highway project transplanted for $148,000; move wasn't paid for with Obama-approved economic stimulus aid
","President Barack Obama regularly disregards laws to impose his preferred policies, Ted Cruz maintains. The Republican senator from Texas hammered that theme in a May 6, 2014, report, the fourth in a series, listing dozens of his concerns covering some previously fact-checked terrain such as work waivers for individuals on Temporary Aid to Needy Families, a topic reviewed by PolitiFact in 2012, plus administration moves softening or putting off parts of the Democrat-propelled 2010 health care law. Cruz set us to digging by declaring the administration ""spent $205,075 in ‘stimulus’ funds to relocate a shrub that sells for $16.""
   This shrub, shown here after it was uprooted from its original site, prompted Ted Cruz’s claim (photo by California Department of Transportation, received by email May 22, 2014). Really? Reported by CNSNews.com The basis for this claim, footnoted in the report, was an April 12, 2012, news article posted online by the CNSNews.com, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email. The Virginia-based service says its goal is to ""provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission."" According to the story, ""Shovel Ready in San Fran: $205,075 to ‘Translocate’ One Shrub from Path of Stimulus Project,"" various agencies in 2010 transplanted a type of bush spotted in San Francisco that until then had been believed extinct in the wild for more than 60 years; the shrub was moved from a highway median where it blocked a stimulus-supported highway renovation to an undisclosed local location where it could continue to bloom in the wild. Meantime, the story said, commercial versions of the Franciscan manzanita, or Arctostaphylos franciscana, could be purchased locally for $15.98 or $18 each. An article about the uncovered plant, on the web page for a Los Angeles botanical garden, says Franciscan manzanitas typically grow about 12 inches tall and spread by rooting branches to form masses from 4 to 6 feet (or more) wide. According to the description, white- to pink-blushed urn-shaped flowers are produced in small terminal clusters. CNSNews.com quoted a spokeswoman for the Presidio Parkway project, Molly Graham, as saying that digging up the uncovered plant, putting it on a truck and driving and planting it elsewhere cost $100,000. The story noted other plant-related costs in a Dec. 21, 2009, 15-year memorandum of agreement involving various agencies teamed up to save and propagate the plant found near the south entrance to the Golden Gate Bridge. In the agreement, the California Department of Transportation, or CalTrans, agreed to transfer $79,470 to ""fund the establishment, nurturing, and monitoring of the Mother Plant in its new location for a period not to exceed ten (10) years following relocation and two (2) years for salvaged rooted layers and cuttings…""  Receiving the money: the federal Presidio Trust, which describes itself as devoted to transforming the Presidio section of San Francisco to a new purpose. CalTrans also agreed to transfer $25,605 to the trust to cover reporting requirements of the initial 10-year period. Adding these figures to the $100,000 to uproot, move and re-plant the shrub leads to total translocation costs of $205,075, CNSNews.com said, not counting up to $23,500 in other post-move shrub-connected costs it identified from the memo. Stimulus money contributed to road project And how did the Obama administration figure in? CNSNews.com reported that grants funded by the economic stimulus package, approved by the Democratic-majority Congress and signed into law by Obama in 2009, are helping to fund the ongoing replacement of an approach to the Golden Gate bridge, which has a total expected cost of $1.045 billion. Some $130 million in stimulus grants, the story said, breaks down to $83.28 million awarded Dec. 24, 2009 (about a month before the bush move) and $46 million awarded Dec. 30, 2010. Our hunt for other accounts of the shrub shift yielded an earlier news story pegging the costs of the shrub move at $175,000--""$140,000 to dig up and move the shrub, and $35,000 for ‘support’ services from geological, botanical and climate experts in preparation for its new home in the Presidio less than a mile away,"" according to a San Francisco Chronicle news story posted online June 2, 2010. Like the CNSNews.com article, the Chronicle story was silent on whether stimulus aid paid for the shrub move. Plant in wild distinct from commercially cultivated version? Separately, botanists declared a difference between the plant found in the wild and others like it. In an April 20, 2012, blog post, the Berkeley, Calif.-based Bay Nature Institute, which says it’s dedicated to educating residents about the beauty of the surrounding natural world, quoted Dan Gluesenkamp, the botanist who originally noticed the lone plant as he drove by the median, as saying it’s misleading to equate the wild Franciscan manzanita with the domesticated version found in garden stores, which has been hybridized for features like pretty flowers, Gluesenkamp said. ""You can go buy a dog for $15 or $230,"" he said, ""but it’s not the same as a wolf in the wild."" The blog post continued: ""The Franciscan manzanita found in garden stores is an offshoot of a wild specimen taken in 1947 from a Laurel Hill cemetery, one of the few remaining wild locations at the time. As the story goes, some of the last remaining wild specimens were salvaged by James Roof, the founding director of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley. In a clandestine nighttime rescue, plantswoman Lester Rowntree ‘garnered it ghoulishly in a gunnysack’ and gave it a new home in her garden. A few more plants found their way into nurseries and botanic gardens, but the species’ known wild habitat was no more,"" the institute said. In September 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the surviving wild manzanita as an endangered species, according to a Sept. 4, 2012, Chronicle news article. Agency: Shrub's move covered by local road tolls Asked how the shrub's move was funded, a CalTrans official, David Yam, replied by email that $148,000 spent to uproot the 21,000-pound plant and move, replant and initially preserve it came from tolls collected on bridges near San Francisco by the Bay Area Toll Authority--not stimulus aid. Yam said major post-move costs, in accord with the memorandum of agreement, are drawing on $105,000 in federal funds, though (again) no stimulus money, he said. Shopping for a Franciscan manzanita Yam agreed a similar cultivated Manzanita plant can be purchased commercially, but he said a 21,000-pound wild Manzanita isn't available. He provided a background document stating the plant discovered on the median is one of three remaining ""wild"" species of the bush; the others are in botanical gardens, the document states. ""Cuttings from the 'wild' plant cannot be purchased by the public,"" the document states. We briefly shopped online for a manzanita Franciscana without finding one. By telephone, Bart O’Brien, a manager at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley, Calif., said that occasionally the garden sells plants, descended from the manzanita Franciscana salvaged from the San Francisco cemetery in the 1940s. When sales happen, he said, the plants sell for $10 to $25. The sold plants are of the same species as the bush saved during the ongoing highway project, O'Brien said, but they’re not the same because they're not growing in the wild. Cruz unmoved Updated on our findings, Frazier said by email the bush never would have been shifted if not for the stimulus-supported road project. Moving the plant wasted tax dollars, she said, and Cruz stands by his claim. Our ruling Cruz said the Obama administration spent ""$205,075 in ‘stimulus’ to relocate a shrub that sells for $16."" Some $130 million in stimulus money is supporting a $1 billion California road project that when it started brought to light a thought-to-be-extinct shrub in the wild. But we learned local road toll revenues covered the shrub’s $148,000 move and transplantation--not stimulus aid. Also, there’s a distinction between the rare in-the-wild version the shrub ballyhooed in the city by the bay and the occasionally available commercial versions, which this claim fails to acknowledge. We rate the statement, which has an element of truth but ignores critical facts such as the singularity of the shrub whose move wasn't funded from stimulus aid, as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Sheriff David Clarke cites violent crime uptick since 2010
","Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. hasn’t declared himself a candidate for mayor or county executive, but he continues to expand his critique of Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and County Executive Chris Abele. After at least 12 people were wounded and three died in shootings during the city’s ""Ceasefire Week,"" Clarke ripped Barrett as a do-nothing mayor in the face of stubbornly high poverty and joblessness, then labeled Abele a know-nothing on crime strategies. The sheriff, who stands for re-election later this year, added a statistical layer to his reaction to the shootings in a statement to reporters. ""This uptick in violence is not new. It has been going on since 2010. The only period of calm we get is when winter sets in,"" the statement said. ""The reason crime and violence rise in the summer is NOT due to the hot weather, leading to short tempers, like so many think. It rises in summer months because you have more human interaction due to more people being on the streets enjoying what little summer we have."" There’s little doubt about summer being too short. But is ""violence"" up since 2010, with the only let up in the winter? To get at the question, we examined the trend in homicides, non-fatal shootings and the broader violent-crime index by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That index  includes homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Homicides After a sharp drop in 2008 and 2009, homicides were at their lowest count since the 1980s. Then they jumped in 2010 from 72 to 95. The figure fell in 2011, but rose in 2012 and 2013, when 105 were recorded. That put the total back to where it was in 2007, shortly before Chief Edward Flynn was sworn in as Milwaukee’s chief. Of the 31 total zip codes that make up the City of Milwaukee, the majority of homicides last year occurred in four, the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission reported -- 53212 (14%), 53204 (14%), 53209 (13%) and 53206 (11%). Milwaukee saw a surge of of 33 homicides in just two months in 2013, August and September. Non-fatal shootings The trend is similar to homicides, but not identical. The number of people wounded by firearms dropped 35 percent between 2006, when it was 621, and 2010, when the figure was 400. But the total has risen three straight years starting in 2011, reaching 532 last year. As in homicides, it’s overwhelmingly the case that the victims are African-American men, according to the commission. Overall violent Crime Total violent crime has risen 21 percent since 2011 -- 1,300 more violent crimes were reported in 2013 compared to 2011. Most of that increase came in aggravated assaults. Milwaukee Police data shows that in every violent crime category the 2013 totals are higher than the 2010 totals. And for the most part, the upward trend has been consistent since 2010, though the uptick in overall violent crime began more recently, in 2012. ""We were as frustrated as the rest of the community was with the increase in violent crime in 2013 over 2012,"" Police Chief Edward Flynn told reporters in March 2014. In contrast, the much larger category of property crime has fallen six straight years, and total crime (violent and property added together) in five of six, according to the department. Seasonal variation The other part of Clarke’s claim was that crime and violence rises in the summer, with winter the ""calm"" period. Criminologists have debunked some other seasonal crime explanations, such as the full moon effect. So we wondered if the numbers back it up. Homicide Review Commission reports and data show a seasonal difference is real, though winter is far from ""calm."" The ugly business of homicide certainly doesn’t close up shop in the colder months. In 2013, the months of December, January and February saw 20 of the year’s 105 homicides. But, the commission noted in 2014 that, ""Generally, in years past, the number of homicides increases during the summer months."" Typically, about 30 percent of annual homicides occur in June, July and August, our analysis of commission data showed. In non-fatal shootings, in both 2012 and 2013 the number of incidents generally increased during the summer months of June through September, the commission reported. ""Specifically, in 2013, 262 nonfatal shootings occurred in June through September,"" the commission reported. In those four months, nonfatal shootings accounted for 49 percent of such incidents in all of 2013. Why? As Clarke said, it’s not just the abstract fact of sinking temperatures. Alcohol consumption and arguments are more common in the hotter months, noted Stephen Hargarten, director of the Injury Research Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin. ""We do know weather has an effect, both ways,"" Hargarten said. ""It has a limited effect but some effect."" Our rating Clarke said Milwaukee has seen ""an uptick in violence"" since 2010, and ""the only period of calm we get is when winter sets in."" Violent crime rates have roller-coastered in recent years, but Clarke’s observations about the trend since 2010 is on target. His observation about a winter ""calm"" period is a bit of a stretch, but it’s certainly calmer than the hot days of summer. We rate his claim Mostly True. Update: an earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that Sheriff Clarke faces re-election in November 2014. He would first have to clear an expected August 12 primary challenge to reach the November 4 general election.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C233FC0>],/factchecks/2014/may/23/david-clarke-jr/sheriff-clarke-cites-violent-crime-uptick-2010/
"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Monica Wehby']","
Was Jeff Merkley the deciding vote on Obamacare?
","The race for a U.S. Senate seat representing Oregon is shaping up to be one of the most-watched political contests of the 2014 election. The race between incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and Republican Monica Wehby could well play a pivotal role in whether Democrats maintain their Senate majority. The lead-up to the May 20, 2014, primary proved rockier than expected for Wehby, a political newcomer and pediatric neurosurgeon, when police reports surfaced detailing domestic incidents involving her former husband and an ex-boyfriend. The claim: The day after the primary, Wehby’s campaign put out a news release that appeared aimed at turning the conversation back to the topic she had focused on for weeks -- health care. ""Jeff Merkley was the deciding vote on Obamacare,"" the release stated, ""which in Oregon has been an unmitigated disaster."" This is hardly the first time a politician has been accused of casting the pivotal vote for the controversial Affordable Care Act. Even so, we thought we’d check to see whether circumstances surrounding Merkley’s vote differ from those of his Democratic colleagues. The analysis: PolitiFact National has checked a slew of claims that different Democratic senators were ""the deciding vote."" Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia’s former attorney general and candidate for governor, said in November 2013, for instance, that U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., cast the deciding vote on the Affordable Care Act. In Florida, an ad made the claim about U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, while others repeated the assertions about Sens. Michael Bennet and Mark Udall, both Democrats from Colorado. Checks in those cases found that none of the senators cast the ""deciding"" vote. A little history: The first Senate vote relevant to the issue occurred on Dec. 23, 2009. It was needed to overcome a filibuster and end debate on the bill, to bring it to a vote for final approval. Senate rules require 60 senators to approve such a motion. The vote to defeat the filibuster came in on the number, with Merkley voting with the rest of his party. But his vote was no more vital than any other, especially since his support was not in doubt. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., by contrast, did need late arm-twisting, agreeing to back the bill only after 13 hours of negotiations, according to news reports at the time. His was the critical 60th vote. Votes on two other bills were needed for the ACA to win final approval. The first, which passed the original version of the Affordable Care Act, needed only a simple majority, making its passage easier. The next was a vote taken March 25, 2010, that officially approved the bill after it had been passed by the House. Merkley joined 56 other senators, making it impossible to say whether his was the vote that sent the ACA to Obama’s desk for signing. We asked Wehby’s campaign to defend the claim. In an email, campaign manager Charlie Pearce replied, ""Thanks to Jeff Merkley’s yes vote on Obamacare, 150,000 Oregonians had their health insurance plans canceled. If Jeff Merkley would have had the courage to vote no on that bill, Obamacare would not have passed, and hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars would not have been wasted on the fiasco that was Cover Oregon.""     The ruling: Wehby’s campaign, fresh off her win in the GOP Senate primary, sent out a news release pinning responsibility for passage of the Affordable Care Act on her Democratic opponent. ""Jeff Merkley was the deciding vote on Obamacare,"" it said, ""which in Oregon has been an unmitigated disaster."" The assertion is just the latest to identify a particular Democratic senator as having cast the ""deciding"" vote for Obamacare. Similar checks have all found the claim to be either Mostly False or False. Wehby’s campaign, asked to defend the claim, sent an email that omitted any mention of Merkley’s ""deciding"" vote. Her assertion that Merkley’s vote resulted in 150,000 Oregonians having their health care plans canceled is a check we’ll leave for another day. Merkley did join his Democratic colleagues in voting for the bill, but it was a senator from Nebraska who provided the needed 60th vote. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C254A40>],/factchecks/2014/may/23/monica-wehby/was-jeff-merkley-deciding-vote-obamacare/

Ed Schultz says Walmart workers rely on $5,800 in public assistance a year
","Leaders of Portland, Ore., made Ed Schultz a very happy man the other night. The city council recently rolled back the city’s investments in Walmart, faulting the retailer’s labor practices. This comes as a delight to Schultz, liberal host of MSNBC’s The Ed Show, who wants the country’s largest (and non-union) retailer to pay its employees higher wages. Walmart jobs pay so little that many employees turn to public assistance, such as food stamps and Medicaid programs, even though they have fulltime jobs, Schultz said during his May 20 show. He used specific figures that caught our attention. ""Walmart workers receive over $2 billion in government assistance each year,"" he said. ""This pencils out to over $1 million in public assistance per store. Easy to figure, isn't it? It’s roughly $5,800 per Walmart employer, employee, those folks that work there, you know?"" Walmart’s wages are not a new topic for fact-checkers, but his numbers were higher than any we’ve heard before. We wanted to check them out. The Democrats and their studies Schultz’s $5,800 figure comes from estimates generated by Democrats of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The report relied on 2012 Medicaid enrollment information in the state of Wisconsin, saying it appeared to be recent and comprehensive. Of all employers in the state, Walmart had more employees (just over 3,200) enrolled in Wisconsin’s Medicaid program, which is called BadgerCare+. Factoring in their children and adult dependents, Walmart employees and their families made up about 9,200 BadgerCare+ enrollees. Using that data, House Democrats estimated a typical Walmart Supercenter with 300 employees would cost taxpayers $904,542 a year, or $3,015 per employee. That figure assumes employees who enroll in BadgerCare+ also enroll in other safety net programs supported by taxpayers, such as food stamps, subsidized housing and school lunches, and the Earned Income Tax Credit. The Democrats then made another assumption: That there are likely more Walmart employees who are eligible for BadgerCare+ but choose not to enroll. That could expand the number of workers who receive public assistance. All totaled, Democrats say, a Wisconsin Walmart Supercenter store could cost taxpayers up to $1.745 million per year, or about $5,815 per employee. The report (page 11) breaks out how both costs were tabulated, looking at BadgerCare+, likely family enrollment in free and reduced lunch and breakfast, food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit, Section 8 housing, child care subsidy programs and a residential energy assistance program for low earners. Estimate A looks at the people currently enrolled in BadgerCare+, while Estimate B includes those employees House Democrats believe are eligible but not enrolled in BadgerCare+.  As Schultz spoke, a screen behind him displayed the more specific estimates from the report -- without noting they were for a Wisconsin Supercenter. Warnings, Walmart’s response, a progressive critic The top line figure Schultz cited, about $5,800 per employee, is built upon a series of assumptions. It’s including the potential for people to receive federal benefits, rather than actually receiving them -- a point Schultz ignores. And it’s notably looking only at the situation in Wisconsin, where the state’s eligibility requirements for Medicaid are more generous than other states. Wisconsin did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, unlike other states, but its program covers children and pregnant women up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, and it covers adults up to 100 percent. These caveats are crucial. For one, Wisconsin’s minimum wage is in line with the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. A total of 21 states and D.C. have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage. That means some Walmart workers in states outside of Wisconsin are likely to make more, which could mean they are less likely to receive government assistance. The report from House Democrats acknowledges its own limitations. ""Because of varying program eligibility requirements across states, extrapolating taxpayer costs for Walmart stores in other states based on the Wisconsin data is difficult,"" the report says on page 10. Without good data from the company, an exact calculation of public costs for a hypothetical store is ""impossible,"" the reports says in another footnote. Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg zeroed in on those clarifications, criticizing the report and pointing to commentary and research from the man President Barack Obama chose to lead his Council of Economic Advisers, Jason Furman. Before joining the White House, Furman hailed Walmart as a ""progressive success story"" in a 2005 report (while acknowledging it, ""like other retailers and employers of less-skilled workers, does not pay does not pay enough for a family to live the dignified life Americans have come to expect and demand."") Furman said enrolling in Medicaid is the sensible choice for some Walmart employees because it allows employees to save $1,800 a year that they would have spent on company health insurance then. Furman also cites a 2005 memo from Susan Chambers, Walmart's executive vice president for benefits, that claimed 5 percent of Walmart associates were on Medicaid and CHIP (often, state-run insurance programs that help cover families who don’t qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private coverage), compared to an average of national employers of 4 percent and a retail average of 6 percent. Walmart employees signing up for Medicaid isn’t a bad thing, Furman argues, as much as it is a desired result of President Bill Clinton’s welfare reforms to ""make work pay,"" incentivizing people with fewer skills in low-wage jobs to work while remaining eligible for assistance. Still, we know many newspapers and labor-funded organizations in 24 states have looked into Walmart employees’ reliance on public safety nets and found a disproportionately higher share of Walmart workers receiving Medicaid and food stamps than other employers. But should progressives be complaining? Furman argued no in 2005. ""It is odd to criticize Walmart because 5 percent of its employees receive Medicaid when the health policy you believe in would ensure that 100 percent of Walmart’s employees received (a better version of) Medicaid,"" he wrote. A spokeswoman for Schultz’s show did not return emails seeking comment. Our ruling Schultz claimed taxpayers pay ""roughly $5,800"" per Walmart employee for social safety net programs. That’s a distortion of a narrowly written report that acknowledged its shortcomings. A 2013 analysis from House Democrats relied on several assumptions in attempting to address the situation of Walmart employees in Wisconsin. The $5,800 figure is inflated by including people who are eligible for Wisconsin’s version of Medicaid but not actually enrolled. The report cautions at many points not to accept its findings as representative of Walmart stores across the country, as eligibility requirements for various programs vary across states. None of this made it into Schultz’s on-air takedown of the country’s largest private-sector employer. Schultz’s statement contains an element of truth but needs significantly more information to paint a fuller picture. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D3D940>],/factchecks/2014/may/23/ed-schultz/ed-schultz-says-walmart-workers-rely-5800-public-a/

Rumors of third Barack Obama term are satire passed off as truth
","Who says President Barack Obama -- facing weak approval ratings, a tough midterm election and growing outrage over problems in veterans’ health care facilities -- is in the dumps? He’s headed to a third term! Or at least that’s the claim now bouncing around the Internet. A reader recently emailed us to ask if we could check out something they’d run into online -- a story titled, ""Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run."" As we'll see, it's another case of a satirical article being passed off as real. The article with a Washington dateline began, ""President Barack Obama shocked the country this morning with news that he is running for a third term."" It went on to quote Obama at a press conference saying,""‘I can’t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever. We’ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you’re getting."" The article then quoted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., telling CNN that he opposes Obama’s decision. ""This defies everything the Constitution stands for,"" Paul is quoted as saying. ""We can not let this man have a third term."" The problem facing Obama, according to the article, is the 22nd Amendment, which prevents presidents from running for more than two terms. It was ratified in 1951. However, the article suggests that Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., has ""recently introduced"" a measure to abolish the 22nd Amendment -- which is ""exactly the kind of news that makes an Obama 2016 Presidential run possible."" The article closes with a comment from Paul Horner, purportedly an administration spokesman. ""Obama is guaranteed to win in 2016 and then we’ll all be able to enjoy this great man for another four years,"" the article quotes ""Horner"" as saying. ""Things could not get any better for the American people. I’m so stoked!"" So is Obama really going to get around the Constitution to run for a third term? Nope. In fact, people passing along this story by email appear not to have noticed that it comes from a satire site called the National Report. The site’s tongue-in-cheek disclaimer says, in part, that ""the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report."" The urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer said, ""National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental."" As it happens, FactCheck.org has been debunking similar ""third-term"" claims since 2009 -- the first year Obama was in office, when he was still three years away from running, legally, for his second term. These earlier chain emails tended to focus on the amendment by Serrano. The National Report satire piece is correct to say that Serrano has introduced such legislation, but it’s hardly as recent a development as the article suggests. As FactCheck.org noted, Serrano introduced a similar measure numerous times during the presidencies of Bill Clinton (1997, 1999 and early 2001) and George W. Bush (2003, 2005 and 2007), with each bill dying in committee without coming to a vote. ""I introduce it as a matter of principle,"" Serrano told FactCheck.org. ""I do not believe there should be term limits for any elected official. Elections should be the deciding factor. I do not receive advice or support on this bill from the White House or any other source."" The current version of Serrano’s repeal bill has, as is typical, attracted no co-sponsors and gone nowhere in committee. No one should be under the illusion that this is an idea going anywhere soon. We asked a White House spokesman if he wanted to comment. He politely declined. Our ruling A chain email now circulating links to an article headlined, ""Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run."" The article comes from a satire website, and even if Obama wanted to do an end run around the constitutional prohibition, the vehicle to do it -- Serrano’s bill -- has no hope of passage, much less any chance of ratification in three quarters of the states. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280974A0E40>],/factchecks/2014/may/23/chain-email/rumors-third-barack-obama-term-are-satire-passed-t/

Cap and trade legislation was originally 'a Republican idea,' Wasserman Schultz says
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a GOP presidential contender, made waves about climate change in a May 11 interview with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on This Week. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" Rubio said. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" One of Florida’s other nationally watched politicians -- Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- criticized her fellow Floridian’s stance. After a May 13 speech at Daemen College in upstate New York, an audience member asked her how to get ""Congress unstuck in stomping on science."" Wasserman Schultz suggested that voters stop electing tea party-aligned politicians -- and then she turned her sights on Rubio for disagreeing with the scientific consensus that climate change is man-made. Wasserman Schultz, who represents parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, said rising sea levels and flooding will make part of her district uninhabitable in the future. She called for politicians to reach across the aisle in search of solutions, singling out a cap and trade plan as an area where the parties could agree. ""That was originally a Republican idea. It was developed in the 1970s when the Clean Air Act was initially adopted."" We decided to check Wasserman Schultz’s claim that cap and trade was originally a Republican idea. Cap and trade The idea of cap and trade is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon individual companies -- typically electric utilities and manufacturers -- can emit. The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively. Wasserman Schultz started the clock ticking in the 1970s. Her spokesman, Sean Bartlett, told PolitiFact Florida that ""the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments were the first time federal law used the concept of offset mechanisms that ultimately became the ‘cap and trade’ systems."" That law included precursor ideas, such as providing industry with flexibility to meet limits, rather than simply imposing controlling regulations, said Eric Pooley, a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund and author of The Climate War: True Believers, Power Brokers, and the Fight to Save the Earth. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan used a cap and trade system to phase out leaded gasoline, noted MIT economics professor Richard Schmalensee and Harvard Kennedy School government professor Robert Stavins. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush proposed the use of a cap and trade system to cut by half sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants and consequent acid rain, they wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed in 2010. ""An initially resistant Democratic Congress overwhelmingly endorsed the proposal,"" the professors wrote. ""The landmark Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 passed the Senate 89 to 10 and the House 401 to 25."" Bush not only accepted the cap, but he sided with environmentalists who wanted a larger cut than his own advisers, according to Smithsonian Magazine, in a report that detailed how the Environmental Defense Fund worked with Bush’s White House to make cap and trade a reality. ""George H. W. Bush does indeed deserve enormous credit for being the champion of the cap and trade program for sulfur dioxide, a major cause of acid rain,"" Pooley said. ""That has led many over the years to refer to it as a Republican idea."" But Pooley said that Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -- a Democrat -- also deserves credit for leading the legislative charge that ultimately passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. ""So if pressed, I would call it a bipartisan idea that was championed by a Republican president,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. In 2005, the EPA under President George W. Bush issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which aimed to achieve ""the largest reduction in air pollution in more than a decade"" using cap and trade, wrote Stavins and Schmalensee. They noted the contributions under Reagan and both Bushes to argue that cap and trade should be embraced by Republicans as well as Democrats. ""After all, these policies were innovations developed by conservatives in the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush administrations (and once strongly condemned by liberals),"" they wrote. In 2003, McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat from Connecticut, introduced the ""Climate Stewardship Act,"" which would have used a similar cap and trade approach to reduce carbon pollution linked to global warming. Versions of the bill were reintroduced in 2005 and 2007. That was the first time legislation was introduced to use cap and trade for carbon emissions, Pooley told PolitiFact. ""The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies,"" McCain said in a floor speech to mark the bill’s 2007 introduction. ""Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life."" McCain’s 2007 version was co-sponsored by Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. And both McCain and Obama had cap and trade programs in their presidential platforms. In June 2009, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a cap and trade bill, by a razor-thin margin, 219-212. But the bill failed to survive in the Senate amid Republican opposition. In 2011, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has taken a firm stand against a cap and trade bill. ""A full-blown fleecing of the middle class, it would raise electricity prices, increase gasoline prices, and ship American jobs to countries like China and India,"" wrote John Boehner, now the Speaker of the House, about the bill in June 2010. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that cap and trade legislation ""was originally a Republican idea."" Experts who have followed the history of the environmental policy focus on the fact that emissions trading to address acid rain became part of the Clean Air Act of 1990 under Bush. The legislation ultimately passed with bipartisan support under a Republican president. More recently, another prominent Republican -- McCain -- co-sponsored cap and trade legislation. Democrats did support cap and trade legislations at different points along the way.

Virginia Democrats say Gillespie was paid $300,000 to lobby for individual mandate
","When money was offered, Democrats say Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie was pleased to support an individual mandate that all Americans have health insurance. ""In 2007, he (Gillespie) was paid $300,000 to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan,"" the Democratic Party of Virginia said earlier this spring in a news release. ""However, just last week, Gillespie’s campaign reversed course and claimed that he ‘consistently opposed the mandates.’"" Gillespie, a former lobbyist, is the overwhelming favorite to win the Virginia GOP’s nomination for the U.S. Senate at a state convention next month and oppose Democrat incumbent Mark Warner this fall. Despite some unclear statements and writings in the past, Gillespie repeatedly has said this year that he’s always been opposed to an individual mandate -- the central provision of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. So we decided to examine the Democrats’ claim that Gillespie was paid $300,000 to seek just such a law. Ashley Bauman, spokeswoman for state Democrats, pointed us to news releases, op-eds and media coverage detailing Gillespie’s involvement with the Coalition to Advance Health Care Reform -- a group of large businesses that formed in early 2007 to find ways of curbing health costs and get more people insured. The coalition’s website listed guiding principles to overhaul the nation’s health care laws. It called for a ""market-based health care system"" that provided financial incentives for people to adopt healthy behaviors and assistance so low-income people would get routine care outside of emergency rooms. But the tenet Democrats’ zero in on is the group’s call for ""universal coverage with individual responsibility."" ""Public policy has long mandated that care be provided when needed. We believe this policy should be balanced with a requirement that individuals carry health insurance regardless of their employment status,"" the group wrote. ""All Americans should have access to affordable quality healthcare services, with no exclusions for pre-existing conditions. The market should drive these policies with the government, businesses and individuals sharing responsibility to ensure affordable health coverage is achieved."" Leading the coalition was Steve Burd, then CEO of the Safeway grocery chain. He announced the formation in a May 6, 2007 op-ed in The Washington Times, writing ""every American should be required to carry health insurance."" The next day, the group announced it had brought in ""nationally-recognized professionals,"" to ""manage the organization."" The two mentioned by name were Gillespie and his lobbying partner, Jack Quinn, a Democrat who had been chief of staff in the mid 1990s to then Vice President Al Gore. Reports filed in the U.S. Senate show Gillespie registered as a lobbyist for the coalition during the first half of 2007. Bauman pointed us to data on the Center for Responsive Politics’ website showing that the coalition in 2007 paid $300,000 to Quinn Gillespie & Associates, a firm that was founded in 2000. Gillespie’s activities Gillespie’s ties to the coalition trace back several months before the its formation was announced. Federal lobbying records show that Quinn Gillespie & Associates registered to represent the coalition on March 1, 2007. The firm listed 16 employees, including Gillespie, as lobbyists for the health care group. Paul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, said his boss never advocated for the mandate and was listed as lobbyist out of an abundance of caution. ""It was the practice at QGA to register even if you were not lobbying lawmakers on behalf of a client,"" he emailed. ""There is a penalty for not registering to lobby and doing lobbying work, but no penalty for registering and not lobbying."" Logan gave us a letter Burd wrote to the Gillespie on March 24, 2014 to rebut attacks that the Republican lobbied for the requirement. ""Your counsel with CAHR was very clear. To establish a set of core principles at a high level to attract a broad coalition and to stay away from any support for an individual mandate,"" Burd wrote. ""As I recall, you were personally opposed to the idea of an individual mandate and encouraged the coalition to stay with market-based principles to guide its work. At no time did you advocate or lobby for an individual mandate on behalf of CAHR."" Burd added, ""in fact you never attended any meetings the coalition had with elected leaders and you left Quinn Gillespie and Associates within a month of the coalition being formed, well before CAHR began to actively engage in the policy debate."" Gillespie did leave his lobbying firm -- about six weeks after his affiliation with coalition was announced -- to start work as an adviser to President George W. Bush on June 26, 2007. Before leaving, Gillespie promoted the coalition’s broad health care agenda during a May 8 radio interview on WBUR in Boston. He was never specifically asked about an individual mandate. But he did say, ""it’s important to emphasize what this coalition is advocating, which is getting people in through individual responsibility and not a mandate -- a government-imposed dictate -- on small businesses."" The payments  Logan said Gillespie did not receive the $300,000 from the coalition but would not provide other compensation figures. Lobbying records show the coalition paid that amount to Gillespie’s firm -- not Gillespie personally -- in 2007. Burd, in an interview, told us he recalls meeting once with Gillespie while forming the coalition, on March 15, 2007. During that session, Burd said Gillespie gave advice on how to organize and rally support for the group. ""There’s not a chance in the world that we would have paid him $300,000 for one meeting,"" he said. Biannual lobbying records show the coalition paid the Quinn Gillespie $120,000 during the first half of 2007, when Gillespie was still with the firm. Most of the money the coalition paid to the firm in 2007 -- about $180,000 -- was remitted in the second half of the year. A year-end lobbying report covering that span did not list Gillespie as a lobbyist. Logan said Gillespie severed all ties with his firm when he became a presidential adviser. So about 60 percent of the coalition’s $300,000 payment was made during the six months after Gillespie left the firm. With this information, we contacted Bauman again and asked for proof of the Democrat’s claim that Gillespie received all of the money. ""We have frequently referred to Gillespie’s firm making more than $300,000, through its work on behalf of CAHR, "" she emailed.  ""In this instance, we should have been clearer, but we stand by the fact that the firm he founded, QGA (Quinn Gillespie & Associates), was paid $300,000 to lobby on behalf of a group that supported the individual mandate."" We should note that Democrats have said at least two other times this year that Gillespie -- not his company -- was paid $300,000 by the coalition. Prior to leaving the firm, Gillespie received a $4.8 million payout based on a 2004 sale of his lobbying company, according to a disclosure form he filed upon entering the White House detailing his finances during the previous 18 months. Logan said that amount was ""scheduled and paid long before Ed agreed to go to the White House."" ""Ed severed all ties to QGA when he went to work at the White House and did not receive any compensation or distributive share from them after he left,"" Logan said. Our ruling The state Democratic Party said Gillespie was paid $300,000 ""to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan."" This, Democrats said, belies Gillespie’s assertion that he’s always opposed mandatory health coverage. There’s no doubt Gillespie was a key adviser to the coalition, as was his business partner. His role was prominently noted in a news release announcing formation of the group, and he spoke on behalf of the group in a radio interview. The group supported an individual mandate, although there’s a bit of hyperbole in the Democrats’ contention it was the ‘centerpiece’ of their agenda. The top item listed on the coalition’s ""core principles"" was bringing market-based efficiency and price transparency to health care. The founder of the coalition says Gillespie privately voiced opposition to a mandate, urged the pursuit of other reforms and never attended the coalition's meetings with politicians. Records show Gillespie’s lobbying firm -- not Gillespie, himself -- was paid $300,000 by the health care coalition in 2007. Gillespie left the firm that June. During the first half of 2007, Gillespie was among 16 people at his firm registered as lobbyists for the coalition. The bulk of the payments came in the second half of 2007, after Gillespie departed. When we pointed this out to the Democratic Party, a spokeswoman backed away from its improbable claim the Gillespie received all the fees paid to his firm. Gillespie’s campaign denies he was paid $300,000, but would not say how much he did pocket. So bits of truth in the Democrats’ statement are tarnished with exaggeration and create an unsupportable story that Gillespie, when the money was right, led a lobbying effort for an individual mandate. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2EAF00>],/factchecks/2014/may/23/democratic-party-virginia/virginia-democrats-say-gillespie-was-paid-300000-l/

Elizabeth Warren says the top five banks are 38 percent larger than at the time of the bailout
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren is making the rounds to promote her new book, A Fighting Chance. In addition to dispelling speculation about a presidential bid in 2016, the Massachusetts Democrat and former Harvard law professor continued to make a case for greater government intervention in the financial sector. On PBS Newshour May 19, 2014, Warren said there’s a need to ""break up these banks,"" which have only gotten bigger since the financial collapse. ""You know, you talked about during the financial crisis we were told these banks are too big to fail,"" Warren said. ""Today, the five largest financial institutions are 38 percent bigger than they were back in 2008, when they were too big to fail."" We found several other instances of Warren giving out this stat, and we thought it was worth a review. Doing the math Warren’s office said the anaylsis came from SNL Financial, a private bank researching firm, and they pointed us to a CNN article describing the report. It found assets from the top six banks were up 37 percent. That's six banks, not five, as Warren said, and the article was from September 2013, so it's a little outdated. Therefore, we decided to do the math ourselves. As we dug in, we realized there are two ways to interpret Warren’s statement. Was she comparing the current top five banks with their pre-recession size? Or was she comparing today’s top five to 2008’s top five? We decided to analyze it both ways. Here’s what we found when we looked at the top five banks in 2013 (the latest available data) and the top five of 2008 (we went with reported assets in the middle of the year, i.e. before Congress passed the bank bailout). Top five banks of 2013 Bank Total Assets JPMorgan Chase & Co. $2,415,689,000,000 Bank of America Corporation $2,104,995,000,000 Citigroup Inc. $1,880,382,000,000 Wells Fargo & Company $1,527,015,000,000 Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. $911,585,000,000 Total $8,839,676,000,000   Top five banks of 2008 Bank Total Assets Citigroup Inc. $2,100,385,000,000 JPMorgan Chase & Co. $1,775,670,000,000 Bank of America $1,723,269,816,000 Wachovia Corporation $812,443,000,000 Taunus Corporation $659,772,000,000 Total $6,411,757,816,000   If you do the math, the top five from the end of 2013 have 38 percent more assets than the top five banks of 2008. That would back up Warren’s claim. But let’s look at it the other way and compare today’s top five to their 2008 holdings. That gets us a different result. Bank Total Assets in 2013 Total assets in 2008 JPMorgan Chase & Co. $2,415,689,000,000 $1,775,670,000,000 Bank of America Corporation $2,104,995,000,000 $1,723,269,816,000 Citigroup Inc. $1,880,382,000,000 $2,100,385,000,000 Wells Fargo & Company $1,527,015,000,000 $609,074,000,000 Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. $911,585,000,000 $884,587,000,000* Total $8,839,676,000,000 $7,092,985,816,000 *Before 2009, Goldman Sachs was an investment group, not a bank holding company, so the data was not available through the Federal Reserve. The 2008 figure is taken from their in-house annual report. There’s still significant growth in those banks, but it’s about 25 percent, not 38 percent. It’s held back by Citigroup, which actually has fewer total assets than it did in 2008. Being in the top five doesn’t necessarily equate to ""too big to fail,"" even though Warren seemed to imply as much. For example, Wachovia was a top five bank in 2008, and it no longer exists. It was absorbed by Wells Fargo during the fallout of the crisis. Warren’s comment ""presumes simply that there is a threshold ‘too big to fail’ size, and implies that the top five having gotten bigger, they were already past that threshold, and (now) are even more ‘too big to fail,’ "" said Satya Thallam, director of financial services policy at the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. ""The size of financial institutions is not per se evidence of ‘too big to fail’ expectations."" Other experts we spoke with echoed that sentiment. There are also other ways to measure bank size, such as total deposits, said Hester Peirce, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.  ""These are very tricky comparisons to make,"" Peirce said. ""There’s not a clear way to measure how size has changed."" How they got so big Warren does not mention how the banks grew, which experts we spoke with said is critical context. Let’s go back to the Wachovia/Wells Fargo example. In 2008, Wells Fargo was the sixth-largest bank, just outside Warren’s arbitrary cutoff. So a significant reason the top five have grown so much is from that one transaction, where two massive banks become one. And Wells Fargo/Wachovia is just one example. Lawrence White, a professor of economics at New York University, noted that Bank of America absorbed Merrill Lynch, which, at the end of 2007, had more than $1 trillion in assets, and JPMorgan Chase took on Bear Stearns, a top 15 financial institution before its collapse. During the financial crisis, the federal government was ""desperate to have these banks merge,"" Peirce said.  ""That is a large contributing factor (in the growth of the top five),"" she said. ""I don’t think that’s the only thing that’s going on, but that’s one of the things that’s going on."" That’s not to say these weren’t controversial decisions. Warren, for the record, opposed those efforts and has said they have made the ""too big to fail"" issue worse. But understanding how it happened is critical to forming an opinion on what the numbers actually mean. Peirce also said consolidation and growth among the top banks are not a new trend. In 2001, the five largest banks held about 27.5 percent of all assets; today it’s closer to 47 percent with the sharpest increases coming before the financial collapse. Our ruling Warren said, ""the five largest financial institutions are 38 percent bigger than they were back in 2008, when they were too big to fail."" Without fully understanding where her math was coming from, we had to find our own way to measure this. One way seemed to back her up in a narrowly defined time frame. A different method produced a lower number, though the trend is the same. Our experts took some issue with her loose characterization of ""too big too fail"" and some of the context she left out. But her underlying point is largely accurate. We rate her comment Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809773DEC0>],/factchecks/2014/may/22/elizabeth-warren/elizabeth-warren-says-top-five-banks-are-38-percen/

Amendment 'allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent'
","Family Feud time! Today’s question: Name something most teenagers cannot do. Vote? Ding! See R-rated movies alone? Ding! Buy beer? Ding! Score some weed without a hitch under Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment? BUZZZZ! An anti-marijuana coalition operating the website DontLetFloridaGoToPot.com has claimed as much. Among the talking points was the assertion, ""The amendment allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent."" There’s already plenty of debate over the legalities of Amendment 2, which is on the November ballot. But can teens easily score a nickel bag solo should it pass? We’ll have to take our own survey and see what it says. A minor hitch Amendment 2 calls for the state to allow patients with cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and unspecified ""other conditions"" to obtain medical marijuana with a doctor’s written recommendation. Technically, the physicians won’t write prescriptions, because marijuana would still be illegal under federal law. If 60 percent of voters ratify the amendment, the state must set up a dispensary system and write regulations for growing and selling the drug. The Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot website lists more than 40 ""coalition partners."" The Orlando Sentinel reported the site is run by Save Our Society From Drugs, a St. Petersburg-based lobbying group, and the Florida Sheriffs Association. The sheriffs association’s tax status prevents it from actively lobbying for people to vote against Amendment 2, but the group publicly opposes the measure. The sheriff’s association and Save Our Society did not answer our questions about why they think teens will be free to roll up spliffs without asking mom and dad first. Others have complained the measure’s language doesn’t set a minimum age, and therefore targets minors. But the vague amendment language is by design, according to the organization behind the amendment. United for Care attorney Jon Mills told PolitiFact Florida that by not addressing the age issue, a topic that was discussed while drafting the proposal, the amendment allows state law to take precedent on the issue of age. Currently, a parent or guardian must provide consent for medical treatment for a minor, except in emergencies or other unusual circumstances, such as when the Department of Children and Family Services must get involved. The absence of an age limit is to allow the state freedom to write the rules as they see fit, should the amendment pass and become part of the state Constitution.    ""If we put a minimum age in we’d never be able to modify it,"" Mills said, referring to how the amendment will change the state’s Constitution, rather than creating a new statute, as many medical marijuana states do. There are 21 states with laws that allow medical cannabis. Only three (California, Washington and Massachusetts) make no mention of minors in their language, as in the Florida amendment. Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors measures to allow medical marijuana, said all three still require parental involvement in some way. Minnesota, which will soon be the 22nd state to allow it, also doesn’t include language about children. Three other states (Connecticut, Delaware and Illinois) specifically exclude allowing minors to use the drug -- and Illinois is on the brink of changing its law concerning kids. The other 15 allow children access to the drug to some degree but only with parental consent. ""In Florida, I think there is no way that minors will actually ultimately be allowed to sign up for medical marijuana without their parent or guardian’s support. In fact, the rules may be even more strict than they are in most states,"" O’Keefe said. She compared Amendment 2 to Massachusetts’ 2012 law, which didn’t mention minors. The state ended up heavily regulating use by children. Vanderbilt Law School professor Robert Mikos pointed out that any teenager would have to go through the same vetting process as adults. That means they would undergo whatever examination, registration and regulation process the state creates. ""Does this mean a 13-year-old could just go in and get a certification? That’s not the case in any state,"" he said. ""There’s nothing about the Florida proposal that says Florida would be worse than any other state."" So if concerns about minors are unfounded, could Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot potentially mean 18- or 19-year-olds? They’re technically teenagers. Mikos says if that’s what Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot is saying, ""it’s a very misleading statement meant to scare people."" He points out that 18-year-olds are allowed to buy tobacco and are allowed prescriptions to Oxycontin, so marijuana probably shouldn’t be treated any differently. Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor who edits a marijuana policy blog, says the opposition’s concern about teen use could possibly be better illustrated by the possibility of those older teens exploiting the system. ""There’s nothing in this to stop college kids on spring break to go into the doctor’s office and saying, ‘My back hurts,’ and getting some, not for medicinal purposes, but because they want to have fun,"" Berman said. But focusing on that angle in medical legislation is a dubious argument. ""There’s nothing else in medicine that we go to a 19-year-old and say, ‘Hey, you need your parents’ permission,"" Berman added. Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot says ""the amendment allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent."" The group didn’t offer us any specifics on what it meant. The amendment is actually silent on the issue of minors. The proposal’s framers say they specifically didn’t include minors in its language in order to let state law reign supreme. Policy experts said state regulations usually dictate parental consent is necessary, and there’s no reason to think Florida would be any different. We should note that in all probability, 18- and 19-year-olds would have access like any other adult.

Barack Obama says tax rates are lowest since 1950s for CEOs, hedge fund managers
","
During a press conference on June 29, 2011, President Barack Obama was asked whether tax increases should be a part of a deal to approve a new debt ceiling -- the subject of long-running negotiations as the current statutory cap on federal debt approaches in August.

Obama said that he believes some types of revenue increases should be included. As part of his answer, he sought to provide some context about current levels of taxation, at least for the most highly compensated Americans.

""You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix,"" Obama said. ""The revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling -- it's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and who are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born. If you're a -- if you are a wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s.""

We realize that Obama offered two different standards -- the lowest rates ever, and the lowest since the 1950s. We’ve decided to use the latter standard -- ""since the 1950s"" -- because the data is more consistent and easily accessible. (With one exception to fund the Civil War, there was no federal taxation prior to 1913.)

The most basic way to look at this question is to use the highest marginal rates for ordinary income -- what’s commonly called the ""top tax bracket."" This rate -- which today is 35 percent -- is applied to any money earned above a certain threshold. For 2011, that level is $379,150 for married couples filing jointly, for individuals and for heads of households, and $189,575 for married couples filing separately.

Assuming you’re talking about the ""ordinary"" income a CEO or a hedge fund manager earns -- a key assumption, which we’ll discuss in more detail later -- Obama is pretty close to right, but not 100 percent.

Between 1960 (when the ""1950s"" faded into history) and the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan pushed through landmark tax cuts, top tax brackets had much higher rates than those in place today. For instance, the top rate was 91 percent in 1960, and 70 percent on the eve of Reagan’s election in 1980.

By 1988, the top federal income tax rate fell to 28 percent, and it stayed there until 1990. It ticked up to 31 percent for 1991 and 1992, before rising to 39.6 percent in 1993.

So, for five tax years -- 1988 through 1992 -- the top tax bracket had a lower rate than today’s top bracket. Put another way, out of 52 tax years since 1960, the top tax rate was lower than today’s only 10 percent of the time. (Today’s top tax bracket has been steady since 2003, so in nine additional tax years, the earlier bracket was tied with today’s.)

That’s not exactly what Obama said, but it's close.

Now for the complications. First, hedge fund managers, who were specifically cited by Obama, typically don’t pay taxes on their income the same way other Americans do.

The bulk of hedge-fund managers’ income is typically considered ""carried interest"" -- that is, their share of profits from the funds they manage. When a fund has capital gains and those gains flow to the manager, they are taxed as a capital gain, not as ordinary income. From a taxation perspective, the difference is significant -- taxation can be as low as 15 percent, rather than the 35 percent paid by everyone else (including other types of Wall Street managers).

The 15 percent rate for capital gains has been in place since 2003, so tax rates for hedge-fund managers’ carried interest isn’t new. But 15 percent is the lowest it has been since 1950, said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. So for hedge-fund managers, Obama’s statement looks correct.

There’s another complication. One more way to analyze Obama’s statement is by effective tax rates. An ""effective"" tax rate is what a typical taxpayer actually pays after deductions, exemptions and the like. It’s always lower than the statutory tax rate, sometimes significantly lower.

There’s data on this, but it’s a bit more scattershot and doesn’t go all the way up to 2011. But we’ll do a quick review of the data.

A 2007 study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez calculated effective tax rates for various income groups.

For people whose income ranked between the top 1 percent and top 0.5 percent, the effective tax rate for individual, corporate, payroll and estate was 34.0 percent in 1960, 36.1 percent in 1970, 37.6 percent in 1980, 31.5 percent in 1990, 35.7 percent in 2000 and 31.3 percent in 2004.

For those earning between the top 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent of the income curve, the numbers were 41.4 percent in 1960, 44.6 percent in 1970, 43.0 percent in 1980, 33.0 percent in 1990, 38.4 percent in 2000 and 33.0 percent in 2004.

For those earning between 0.01 percent and 0.1 percent, the rates were 55.3 percent in 1960, 59.1 percent in 1970, 51.0 percent in 1980, 34.3 percent in 1990, 40.2 percent in 2000 and 34.1 percent in 2004.

Finally, for those in the top 0.01 percent of the income distribution, the effective tax rate was 71.4 percent in 1960, 74.6 percent in 1970, 59.3 percent in 1980, 35.4 percent in 1990, 40.8 percent in 2000 and 34.7 percent in 2004.

So for each of these elite income groups, the effective tax rates were at or near historical lows in 2004, though for certain groups, the effective rate was equal or slightly lower in 1990. Of course, this data is seven years old.

Meanwhile, the 2010 Economic Report of the President included a table that showed ""that the effective tax rates that applied to high-income taxpayers reached their lowest levels in at least half a century in 2008."" The table (labeled table 5-8) had data running back to 1960 and for both taxpayers earning at least $250,000 and taxpayers earning over $2 million. The table mirrors the Piketty-Saez data in that the 2008 levels are at or near lows for the period, with only the early 1990s coming close.

So where does this leave us? There’s some degree of uncertainty in making this kind of statement, since a very high-earning American’s tax rate can vary greatly, depending on the kinds of income earned (and what tax rate it’s subjected to) and the kinds of exemptions and deductions claimed on their return.

Even so, when Obama said that ""if you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s,"" he's close: Their tax rates are at or near the lows for the years elapsed since then.

The top marginal income tax rates were lower between 1988 and 1992 than they are today, but otherwise, Obama is right. They were higher for the other years. Meanwhile, the rates that are used to tax carried interest for hedge-fund managers have been at historical lows since 2003. And effective tax rates for high-income earners were either at their lowest since 1960 or very close to their lowest (at least according to the most recent data available). On balance, we rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809770AC40>],/factchecks/2011/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-tax-rates-are-lowest-1950s-ceos-/

Michele Bachmann uses Barack Obama's 'one-term' president comment against him
","
It’s becoming a staple of Michele Bachmann’s interviews and stump speeches: The notion of just one term for President Barack Obama … suggested by none other than President Barack Obama himself.

But is it accurate?

During the roll-out of her presidential campaign on June 27 and June 28, 2011, Bachmann -- a three-term Republican congresswoman from Minnesota -- used a variation on the line several times.

Presidential campaign announcement, Waterloo, Iowa, June 27: ""We're practical people. We know our country can work; we just want it to work again. It's a very powerful coalition that the left fears; and they should, because, make no mistake about it, Barack Obama will be a one-term president. In February 2009, President Obama was very confident that his economic policies would turn the country around within a year. He said, and I quote, 'A year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.' Well, Mr. President, your policies haven't worked. Spending our way out of the recession hasn't worked. And so Mr. President, we take you at your word.""

Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, June 27: ""The president has not delivered as he said that he would. I gave a quote in my announcement speech today, Sean. It was from February 2009. And the president of himself said, if he wasn't able to turn the economy around by the third year of his presidency that in all likelihood, he would be a one-term president. And what I said today in my speech today, is that I take the president at his word. And I think the American people are all too eager to make him a one-term president.""

Interview with Rebecca Jarvis of CBS News, June 28: ""Remember, President Obama said in February of 2009, if he wasn't able to turn the economy around by the third year of his presidency, that he should only be entitled to one term in office. I think the American people agree with that.""

Backyard event in Raymond, N.H., June 28: ""In February 2009, the president gave an interview, and in that interview he said, 'If I failed to turn the economy around by the third year, then we will have a precedent for being a one-term president.' ... Do you think we should take him at his word? I do, too.""

Each of these comments by Bachmann is slightly different, but the gist is always the same: In the interview -- with NBC’s Matt Lauer on Feb. 1, 2009, just days after his presidency began -- Obama said it was up to him to turn the economy around in three years, and if not, he doesn’t deserve a second term.

So we looked back at the original interview. Here’s the transcript of the relevant portion:

Lauer: ""At some point will you say, `Wait a minute. We've spent this amount of money, we're not seeing the results. We've got to change course dramatically.’ ""

Obama: ""Yeah, look, I'm at the start of my administration. One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years and...

Lauer: ""You're going to know quickly how people feel about what's happened.""

Obama: ""That's exactly right. And you know, a year from now I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress. But there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.""

Obama’s last phrase -- ""there's going to be a one-term proposition"" -- is a little awkward, but we don’t think there’s much doubt about his meaning. We understand his comment to mean that if the economy isn’t better in three years, the voters might make him a one-term president.

So is Bachmann correctly framing Obama’s comment? In her announcement speech, she did remove one sentence from what she described as a direct quote -- ""But there's still going to be some pain out there."" Taking it out does eliminate one indication that Obama acknowledged that even an improved economy would inflict some pain on Americans.

This isn’t a trivial omission, but it’s not a major one. More important, we're not convinced that the president said he actually would be a one-term president if the economy has not improved in three years -- just that he raised the possibility that voters would make that call. Each of the phrasings we cited above is slightly different, but we think that she is justified in pointing out that Obama offered a three-year framework for turning the economy around and that he acknowledged that Americans might not support a second term if he didn’t deliver. So we rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C9A6C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/29/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-uses-barack-obamas-one-term-presi/

John Boehner says they don't, but polls on taxes show many do
","
Republicans stopped negotiations on raising the debt limit with Democrats on Thursday June 23, 2011, saying they would not agree to any increases in taxes.

The debt ceiling is the legal limit on the amount of debt the United States is allowed to hold. If the government needs to go over that limit, Congress first needs to grant permission. The U.S. is expected to hit the debt limit -- a mind-boggling $14.3 trillion -- later this summer.

Republicans, led by Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., have been negotiating with Vice President Joe Biden to try to reach agreement to raise the debt limit. Republicans want spending cuts, but Democrats have said new revenue-raisers should be included as well. Revenue-raisers could include traditional tax increases or could mean ending tax exemptions and closing loopholes.

On Thursday, Speaker of the House John Boehner of Ohio repeated the Republican position that tax increases couldn't be part of any deal: 
""Listen, we've got to stop spending money that we don't have, and since the beginning, the majority leader and myself, along with Sen. McConnell and Sen. Kyl have been clear: tax hikes are off the table. First of all: raising taxes is going to destroy jobs. If you raise taxes on the people that we need to grow our economy and to hire new workers, guess what: they're not going to do it if they have to pay higher taxes to the federal government. Second, a tax hike cannot pass the U.S. House of Representatives. It's not just a bad idea, it doesn't have the votes, and it can't happen. And third, the American people don't want us to raise taxes. They know that we've got a spending problem. That's why Republicans passed a budget that pays down debt over time without raising taxes.""

There's a lot in that statement, but we what we wanted to fact-check today is Boehner's final point: The American people don't want us to raise taxes. We've seen polling data that contradicts that, so we thought it was time for a review of the evidence. 

As with most polling, the answers you get depend on how you ask the questions. 

The pollsters at Gallup conduct an annual survey in which they ask, ""Do you consider the amount of federal income tax you have to pay as too high, about right, or too low?""

This year, a majority -- 50 percent -- said ""too high."" (That's in line with previous years and even a bit lower than in the 1990s.) Another 43 percent said ""about right,"" and a measly 4 percent said ""too low.""

The poll, conducted in April right before Tax Day, also asked about fairness: ""Do you regard the income tax which you will have to pay this year as fair?"" 
To that question, 40 percent say their taxes are not fair, but 57 percent say, yes, their taxes are fair.  
So too high, but fair? Isn't that contradictory? Gallup says not necessarily. 
""Notably, more Americans consider their taxes fair than say they pay the right amount in taxes (57 percebt vs. 43 percent), suggesting more people dislike what they pay than feel it is unjust,"" the pollsters concluded.  
All right, so nobody likes taxes. But what about public policy? 
Boehner's office referred us to a recent Bloomberg poll on the economy, which asked, ""Which of the following approaches is more likely to be successful in growing the U.S. economy and creating jobs?"" 
The number one answer, with 55 percent, was ""Spending cuts and tax cuts will give businesses more confidence to hire. The other choices were, ""Government needs to keep spending at current level now because the job market is so weak"" (17 percent); ""Government needs to spend more to stimulate the economy"" (also 17 percent); and ""Not sure"" (11 percent). 
The poll also asked, ""Would you be willing to pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit, or are you not willing to pay more, even if the deficit grows?"" A large majority, 61 percent, said they were not willing to pay more. About 36 percent said they were willing to pay more.  
Still, we found a number of polls that indicate people do want the government to raise taxes. That was most clearly the case when it comes to raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. 
Several polls ask people if taxes should be increased on people who make more than $250,000. Polls show substantial majorities support the idea. We found majorities of 72 percent, 64 percent, and 59 percent. (Those are from April polls by ABC News/Washington Post, McClatchy-Marist, and USA Today/Gallup, respectively.)  
On whether corporations pay enough in taxes, Gallup found that 67 percent said they pay too little. 
Finally, we should note one area where we found contradictions on tax increases --in polls that ask people if they favor spending cuts, tax increases, or some combination thereof.  
A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted at the beginning of May found that most people, 52 percent, favored a combination of cuts and tax increases. The NBC/Washington Post poll from April found that number was even higher, at 59 percent.  
On the other hand, when you don't give people the option of both, they favor spending cuts over tax increases by significant margins. We found a Reuters/Ipsos poll from March that found people favored spending cuts over tax increase by 56 percent to 30, and a CBS News/New York Times poll from January that put it at 62 to 29. 
But then we found polls that asked participants if they preferred cuts to benefits such as Social Security and Medicare over tax increases. In those cases, the results favored tax increases. The CBS News/New York Times poll found that 62 percent favored increasing taxes before Medicare benefits are cut. 
We turned to Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who studies polling and has conducted a review of polls on taxation. We asked her, why the contradiction? Here's what she had to say: 
""Generally, combinations of tax hikes and spending cuts are most popular. It seems fair to most people. Spending cuts are favored in the abstract. Tax hikes are favored as long as they don't affect me. Generally, people don't think anybody should have to pay more than a quarter of their income in total taxes. 
""Those are general statements I think we can make. As someone who reads almost all the polls, it is very hard for me to go beyond these generalities. Hypothetical questions about what Congress or the administration should do are especially dangerous because people think in concrete and not abstract terms,"" she said.  
Marc Mellman, CEO of the Mellman Group and a Democratic pollster, agreed that people tend to favor a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts when it comes to balancing the budget. 
""People don't want to pay more taxes, but to deal with the deficit, they prefer a balanced approach that combines tax increases with spending cuts,"" he said.  
In conclusion, Boehner said that ""the American people don't want us to raise taxes."" In fact, polls indicate that people don't like taxes, but they are often okay with increasing specific taxes or closing loopholes. Additionally, when it's time to make hard decisions about the budget, they favor a balanced approach of spending cuts and tax increases. Finally, they tend to favor tax increases for other people -- such as the wealthy or corporations -- if not themselves. Overall, we rate his statement Barely True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809671F0C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/29/john-boehner/polls-taxes-show-people-favor-mixed-approach/
"['Georgia', 'History', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich cites Reagan's 1980 bid to say he can win presidency
","
Newt Gingrich took to summoning the memory of President Ronald Reagan recently to convince supporters he still has a shot at the presidency.

The Republican candidate spoke at the Atlanta Press Club on June 22, the morning after news broke that two of his top fundraisers had quit, and days after a mass exodus of high-level campaign staffers.

They said his campaign was spending money it did not have, and Gingrich wasn’t doing enough to repair damage from a gaffe he made on Medicare. His luxury vacation to Greece made him look uncommitted and out of touch, they complained.   

The former U.S. House speaker told a wall of TV news cameras that he was there to talk about economic policy; he would not take questions about his campaign.

But he did address its turmoil, albeit briefly. ""Campaigns go up and down,"" Gingrich said, and he offered a tidbit of political history.   

""On the day of the New Hampshire primary in 1980, the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan’s staff quit,"" Gingrich said.

Did they?

To test Gingrich’s claim, we turned to some experts on our nation’s 40th president, as well as books that chronicle Reagan’s successful 1980 campaign.

Yes, there was a mass exodus from the Reagan campaign. It began about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day he won the New Hampshire primary by a landslide.

Reagan’s campaign manager at the time was John Sears. Some critics blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses. Others thought he was too moderate, or that he was spending too much campaign money. Reagan resented that the press saw him as Sears’ puppet.

Reagan decided to clean house. On the afternoon of the New Hampshire primary, he met with Sears, press secretary Jim Lake, and national political director Charlie Black in his hotel suite at the Holiday Inn.

Reagan told Sears he planned to make some changes and handed him a piece of paper. It was a press release announcing Sears had resigned from the campaign to return to his law practice.

Sears got the hint. He, Black and Lake left the campaign.

That evening, as the Reagans celebrated their blowout victory, staffers loyal to the three departing aides packed up.

Craig Shirley’s ""Rendezvous With Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed America"" contains the most detailed account we could find of the departures. (Shirley, who has worked for prominent Republican politicians, is writing a book on Gingrich’s early years.)

Top assistants for Sears and Lake quit, the book said. Black’s assistant assumed she was fired and left with them. Twelve additional members of the Reagan campaign resigned in protest.

Afterward, Reagan’s new campaign manager William Casey, future head of the Central Intelligence Agency, fired about half of the campaign’s 275 or so staffers.

Things get fuzzy from here.

It’s not entirely accurate to say these staffers ""quit,"" as Gingrich said. Reagan told The Washington Post that he ""wouldn’t call it a firing,"" but Sears held a news conference and said he was fired and not offered another job. It’s fair to say that at the very least, Sears was pushed out.

Confirming the number of Reagan’s staffers who left is also a bit complicated.

Shirley’s account mentions 18 of them.  A Washington Post account published the day after the firings said that ""by nightfall, a total of seven campaign aides had joined the exodus."" That same day, The New York Times said ""other high-ranking campaign aides . . . were expected to resign soon.""

Gil Troy, author of ""Morning in America,"" a study of Reagan’s presidency, told PolitiFact Georgia in an email that ""it is very plausible they [the resignations] reached thirteen that first day -- and almost tenfold within days.""

Here’s another hitch. Sears, Lake and Black were clearly among Reagan’s top aides, but whether those who left were ""the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan’s staff"" is debatable. Reagan’s ""top people"" included Sears’ replacement Casey and others who replaced them.

In conclusion, Gingrich’s reference to the Reagan campaign isn’t perfect.

It’s not entirely correct to say Reagan’s top three staffers quit. Sears said they were fired, and at the very least, they were pressured to leave. Gingrich’s count of 13 Reagan staffers is debatable, as is his description of them as ""the top"" aides.  

But Gingrich’s main point stands. There was a mass departure from the Reagan campaign. It began on the day of the 1980 New Hampshire primary. It included Reagan’s campaign manager Sears and other key members of the operation.

We therefore rate Gingrich’s claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280F62BD6C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/29/newt-gingrich/gingrich-cites-reagan-bid-say-he-can-win-presidenc/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Women On the Wall']","
Rebecca Forest says few Latino legislators served in states that passed immigration enforcement measures
","
Addressing a rally outside the Texas Capitol, an advocate for requiring city police departments to check the immigration status of residents critiqued the makeup of the Texas Legislature.

According to a video pointed out by the Texas Democratic Party, Rebecca Forest, co-founder and past president of the Immigration Reform Coalition of Texas, said June 11: ""If you really want to know why in Texas we don’t get immigration legislation passed, it’s because we have 37--36--Hispanic legislators in the Texas Legislature. All of the states that have passed legislation have a handful. And I mean literally, some of them have no Hispanic legislators, maybe 3 or 5. So that's part of our problem and we need to change those numbers. We need to do something about that.""

We wondered if indeed states with laws targeting illegal immigration have few Hispanic legislators.

Forest, who later told us she spoke at the rally on behalf of Women on the Wall, a group of conservative women, said in a June 17 interview with KRLD-AM’s Scott Braddock that she strayed from her notes at the rally and had solely intended to single out Hispanic legislators who are liberal Democrats--traditional opponents of legislation like the sanctuary-city proposal that did not pass into law.

""I wish I would have said that,"" she said.

Braddock posted the interview online with a statement he said he fielded from Forest. The statement says she’d previously endorsed a Latino Republican, state Rep. Larry Gonzales of Round Rock. ""There are many things I should have said differently that day but I’ve always hated it when politicians (in particular) try to cover their tails when they mess up by saying ‘I misspoke’ though obviously — I did,"" the statement says.

To our inquiry about Forest’s rally statement, Maria Martinez, the coalition’s executive director, replied by email: ""Our whole thrust of border security has nothing to do with racial identity. Obviously as a Hispanic myself, that statement does not reflect mine or the organization's sentiments.""

To check Forest’s claim, we looked for states that have lately passed immigration enforcement measures and determined how many Latino legislators serve in the states. As Forest said, the Texas House and Senate include 37 Hispanic members, comprising 20 percent of the state’s 181 legislators, according to a state-by-state count by the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures.

A council spokeswoman, Meagan Dorsch, pointed us to NCSL web pages tracking legislation related to immigration; one says that as of March 31, 26 states had enacted laws this year touching in some way on immigration, down from 34 states by the same date in 2010.

Since Forest was currying support for legislation requiring law officers to check the immigration status of every arrested person, we narrowed our national look to states that approved proposals permitting or directing law officers to check the legal status of residents.

This year, according to the NCSL, such proposals were introduced in 42 states, though only one such proposal had been signed into law by April 1. Utah’s House Bill 497 requires an officer to verify the immigration status of anyone arrested for a felony or a Class A misdemeanor and anyone booked for class B or C misdemeanors.

In 2010, Arizona’s legislature drew national attention with its new law requiring officers to attempt to determine the immigration status of any person involved in a lawful stop, detention or arrest when they reasonably suspect the person is an illegal immigrant. According to the NCSL’s breakdown of 2010 state immigration measures, Tennessee and South Carolina also passed measures intended to encourage officers to check residents’ immigration standing.

The group says Tennessee’s House Bill 670 mandated the development of standardized written procedures for verifying the citizenship status of individuals arrested, booked, or confined in a county or municipal jail or detention facility--and reporting individuals in possible violation of federal immigration laws.

South Carolina’s HB 4657, NCSL says, directed the launch of a 24-hour toll-free telephone number and electronic website to receive, record, collect and report allegations of violations of federal immigration laws.

A search of news archives showed that Georgia’s legislature this year advanced a proposal into law, effective July 1, authorizing police to check the immigration status of suspects and to hand over to federal authorities anyone who is in the country illegally, according to a Wall Street Journal blog post. The June 28 post says a federal judge just blocked parts of the law, ruling that challengers in court were likely to prevail in their claims that federal law preempts Georgia’s right to empower police to investigate the immigration status of suspects.

And how many Hispanic members serve in the legislatures of the states whose laws we sketched out above? As of this year, NCSL says, the respective counts are: Utah, five of 104 legislators (nearly 5 percent); Arizona, 13 of 90 (14 percent); Georgia, 2 of 236 (1 percent); Tennessee, 1 of 132 (1 percent); and South Carolina, 0 of 170.

To our query, the National Association of Latino Elected Officials provided identical figures for the states.

Among all states, the NCSL says, New Mexico has the greatest share of Hispanic lawmakers, 45 of 112 (40 percent), followed by Texas, 39 of 181 (22 percent) California, 23 of 120 (19 percent), and Arizona. In more than 40 states, Latinos comprise less than 10 percent of each state’s legislature; about 15 states have no Hispanic legislators.

Five percent or less of the legislators in four of five states that recently directed law officers to check immigration status are Latino Americans; in the fifth state, none is. We rate Forest’s statement True. 
UPDATE, 3:37 p.m., June 29, 2011: After we published this article, the NCSL told us the numbers it initially described as up to date were outdated. We've amended our story to reflect the group's state-by-state Hispanic legislator count for 2011. These changes did not affect the Truth-O-Meter rating.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696C440>],/factchecks/2011/jun/29/women-wall/rebecca-forest/

Rep. Tim Ryan says Head Start programs are cost beneficial
","
As part of Congress’ budget debates, Rep. Tim Ryan cautioned against major cuts while the economy is weak, and said he especially opposed cutting funds for Head Start.

Head Start is a national program that tries to bolster school readiness through educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families.

While interviewing Ryan on Fox News, Greta Van Sustern criticized Head Start because of the academic performance of 8th graders in the Washington, D.C., school system.

Ryan defended the program, claiming that ""for every dollar we invest in Head Start, we get $5 to $7 back into our economy.""

That kind of return got our attention, so we decided to follow the statistical threads to see if Ryan’s claim is backed by whole cloth or solid evidence.

We started with Ryan’s staff. They cited a paper from 2007 by scholars Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Deborah A. Phillips of Georgetown University, which also alludes to other studies.

The researchers conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the program and concluded that that Head Start’s return to taxpayers is greater than their investment in the program. They based their conclusion on studies that compared the performance over decades of siblings who enrolled in Head Start, and siblings that did not, for example.

Among their findings: 
While Head Start doesn’t create jobs itself, children exposed to Head Start are more able to compete for better jobs than those without that exposure, they concluded.

The Ludwig-Phillips paper also cited a study of Perry Preschool, an early care and education program in Michigan similar to Head Start, charting the progress of 3- and 4-year-olds through two years, and also examined their success rate through age 40.

The researchers did issue a few caveats.

Studying program participants over several decades allowed them to follow outcomes into adolescence and adulthood to assess longterm impacts, but they acknowledge that some of the data available to study children from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was limited.

Also, Head Start has changed over time, making it a challenge to apply the data to children in the program now. Forecasting outcomes from kids in Head Start now involves use of ""a number of untestable assumptions,"" they said.

Nonetheless, they concluded that with the average cost of Head Start at $9,000 per child, the early education and social intervention programs ""are likely sufficient to generate benefits in excess of costs in both the short- and long-term.""

A letter sent to Congress in March 2011, signed by more than 300 researchers from around the country, also supported the notion that Head Start is cost effective. It cited a $7 to $9 return for every dollar invested in the programs based on the findings of 12 different studies and reports.

They estimated that the program’s required medical screenings, vaccinations and emphasis reduced annual Medicaid expenses by $232 per family.

And commentary about the scholarly tract by Ludwig and Phillips in a 2007 edition of Social Policy Report suggests that Head Start might have low-balled its own effectiveness.

Commentary by W. Steven Barnett of Rutgers University on the Ludwig-Phillips paper cites studies of three different programs similar to Head Start, one of which found a 2.5 to 1 return ($2.50 for each $1), one that estimated a 10.1 to 1 return, and one that noted a 16.1 to 1 return.

Each study examined a different public early care and education program and based its findings on myriad categories including earnings by people who went through the programs in early childhood.

So how does Ryan’s statement fare on the Truth-O-Meter?

The statement is accurate.

Numerous studies support the notion that Head Start is cost beneficial. Ryan’s numbers land right in the middle of the cost-benefit estimates. While some are as high as $16.10 for each dollar spent, there are some as low as $2.50.

That the researchers caution that forecasting outcomes from kids in Head Start now is difficult is an additional piece of information. While there’s decades of data, programs have also changed over time.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Ryan’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A2DC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/29/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-says-head-start-programs-are-cost-ben/

Sen. Mike Doherty says minority of New Jersey income earners pay nearly half state’s income taxes

","
It’s a statistic long touted in New Jersey to demonstrate the tax-paying discrepancy among residents:

A very small percentage of New Jersey’s top income earners pay about 40 percent of New Jersey’s income taxes.

In recent months the statistic has been cited in arguments about whether to reinstate the so-called millionaire’s tax, and state Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) mentioned it in a May 24 guest editorial in The Star-Ledger. In explaining New Jersey’s progressive income tax, Doherty described how he wants an equal amount of money spent on educating every New Jersey child, regardless of need.

HIs column came in the wake of a state Supreme Court ruling that New Jersey must give an additional $500 million to the state’s 31 low-income – or Abbott – districts.

""In 1976, New Jersey instituted a state income tax to provide sufficient funding for our public schools,"" Doherty wrote. ""After the income tax is collected, it is distributed to towns as school aid. New Jersey’s income tax rate is very progressive. The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing.""

Doherty added in his column that New Jersey’s progressive tax structure accounts for economic differences among residents: those who earn more pay more, those who earn less pay less – one reason why those at the lower end of the income scale aren’t paying as much in income taxes.

PolitiFact New Jersey checked the statistic and found Doherty’s claim to be true.

Andy Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, confirmed Doherty’s math for us.

""The senator’s statement is indeed accurate,"" Pratt said in a June 2 email. ""In some years the number is a little higher than 40 percent, in others a bit lower. But historically, it’s been around 40 percent.""

Pratt pointed to 2009 as a good example of Doherty’s statistic.

""The total take from the gross income tax was $9.135 billion,"" Pratt wrote. ""The take from the top 1 percent of filers (both resident and non-resident) was $3.715 billion or about 40.7 percent. Note that, historically, half of the top 1 percent make more than a million (dollars).""

Steve Lonegan, state director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans For Prosperity, which leans conservative, also backs up Doherty’s numbers. He blasts the state’s progressive income tax structure as making New Jersey bad for business and a reason why the state has highest tax burden in the country.

""It’s worse than not a good thing,"" Lonegan said of the state’s progressive tax structure. ""It’s a destructive thing. It’s based on the whole concept of the people who have the votes can take from those who can’t.""

A flat, or flatter tax in New Jersey, would improve the economic scales for all, said Lonegan, also a former mayor of Bogota in Bergen County.

Mark Robyn, an economist with the pro-business Tax Foundation in Washington, DC, told PolitiFact New Jersey that there are other states that have even higher progressive tax rate structures than New Jersey: Hawaii, California and Oregon, among them.

""There are states with higher marginal tax rates, but whether that relates to a greater reliance on the top 1 percent (of income earners), it’s hard to say,"" Robyn told us.

Robyn also noted that New Jersey ranks number one in total state and local tax burden by percentage of income for 2009, the most recent year that data is available.

Returning to Doherty’s statement, let’s review. The senator said the top 1 percent of income earners in New Jersey pay 40 percent of all state income taxes and those at the bottom pay little or nothing. The state Treasury Department and two conservative-leaning organizations back up that claim, noting that the Garden State’s progressive income tax structure accounts for economic differences among residents by requiring those who earn more to pay more. A liberal-leaning organization notes that looking at all taxes, not just income tax, would show the impact of New Jersey’s tax structure on its residents.

We rate Doherty’s statement True.

James Clyburn says Democrats ""do not want to raise anybody's tax rates. That's never been on the table.”
","
On the June 26, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. -- the third-ranking House Democrat -- discussed tax policy.

Amanpour noted that key Republicans participating in negotiations led by Vice President Joe Biden over the rapidly approaching debt ceiling had recently walked away, saying their party couldn’t stomach any deal that involves tax hikes. Amanpour asked Clyburn, ""What do you think is going to be the result of the meetings between President Obama and the leadership when they start tomorrow?""

Clyburn responded, ""Well, I don't know what they're going to do in those meetings, but I think that we had some very effective meetings. We had 10 meetings, and of course when the Republicans walked away from the table, it was on the day that we were to have our either last or next to the last meeting. I thought we were doing very, very good.

""Now, the question is, how do you define a tax increase? And I don't know of anybody who will define a tax increase as closing the loophole. If you tell me that my tax rate is going to be 30 or 35 percent and I come up with all kind of gimmicks with pretty smart lawyers and only pay 9 percent, there's something wrong with the loopholes in the law. We want to close those loopholes up. We do not want to raise anybody's tax rates. That's never been on the table. And I wish they would get beyond their talking points and really get honest with the American people as to what these discussions are about.

""We ought not have these oil subsidies. We ought not have all these ethanol subsidies. We ought not have all these new breaks for millionaires and billionaires. We ought to be honest with the American people and have an effective tax rate that will be fair to everybody.""

We wondered whether Clyburn was accurate when he said, ""We do not want to raise anybody's tax rates. That's never been on the table.""

To understand Clyburn’s comment, we need to go back a bit. During 2001 and 2003, the Republican-controlled Congress and President George W. Bush enacted a series of tax cuts. Unless they were affirmatively extended before expiration at the end of 2010, the rates were set to return to their level prior to their initial passage -- specifically, to rates that prevailed under President Bill Clinton.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, President Barack Obama promised to extend the cuts for individuals with incomes below $200,000 and couples with incomes below $250,000 while ending the lower tax rates for Americans above those thresholds.

In December 2010, Obama -- under pressure from Republicans who had just prevailed in the midterm elections -- agreed to keep the tax cuts not just for Americans below those thresholds, but also for upper-income Americans. The two sides agreed to extend the cuts for everyone for another two years, through the end of 2012.

However, Obama did not go as far as many Republicans would have liked. They would have preferred to extend the Bush tax cuts indefinitely, or at least for a longer period, for all taxpayers regardless of income. After announcing the two-year extension, Obama reaffirmed his opposition to them over the longer term. ""In the long run, we simply can't afford them,"" Obama said. ""And when they expire in two years, I will fight to end them.""

That brings us to 2011. In analyzing Clyburn’s statement, we think it’s fair to look at the tax record of House Democrats, since Clyburn is a House Democratic leader.

It turns out that House Democrats took their cue from Obama when assembling their 2012 budget proposal, which was released by the Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee on April 13, 2011.

Here’s the relevant part of the proposal: ""The Democratic budget makes permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for working Americans (individuals with income below $200,000 and couples below $250,000), but does not extend the tax cuts for those with higher incomes. … It expressly rejects the approach in the Republican resolution that provides millionaires with even larger tax cuts at the expense of middle-income taxpayers.""

Being in the minority in the House, the Democrats were unable to pass their proposal. But the chamber did take a floor vote on it. On April 15, 2011, the House voted down the proposal, 166-259. But despite unanimous Republican opposition, the proposal won the backing of the overwhelming majority of Democratic lawmakers, with 166 voting in favor of it and only 23 voting against. Among those who voted for it was Clyburn himself.

When we contacted Clyburn’s staff, a spokeswoman said that the congressman, in his CNN comment, ""was addressing what was specifically discussed in the Biden deficit reduction meetings. Ending the Bush tax cuts was not discussed in those meetings, but closing loopholes for big oil, corporations and the wealthy were raised as potential sources of revenue.""

We can see his point -- it's true that Amanpour’s question was directed at the talks led by Biden, and in his answer, Clyburn did mention the wisdom of closing various ""loopholes."" Still, we think a reasonable person would interpret Clyburn’s comment as having broader implications.

Clyburn said that Democrats don’t want to raise ""anybody’s"" tax rate, and that tax hikes have ""never been on the table."" But the reality is that Clyburn and his own caucus proposed tax hikes for wealthier Americans and then voted for them on the House floor. While Clyburn’s explanation does make some sense, we think it’s the only interpretation that would make his claim accurate. A broader interpretation -- and one we think would be more obvious to viewers -- would suggest that his statement is incorrect. So we rate his statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A9C00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/28/james-clyburn/james-clyburn-says-democrats-do-not-want-raise-any/
"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Alberta Darling']","
On pay for fired Milwaukee police officers, Darling does full reversal
","
In the middle of the night on June 2, 2011, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee took up a surprise budget amendment: pay for fired Milwaukee police officers.

It’s a topic lawmakers have addressed twice in three years in the wake of public outrage over the treatment of officers fired for their roles the 2004 Frank Jude beating case. Nine officers were fired for their roles in that incident. Anger mounted as officers were paid by taxpayers while they fought their dismissals.

The Legislature first blocked pay for cops charged with serious crimes.

Then, lawmakers extended the ban to officers dismissed for lesser infractions, including department rule violations.

The amendment, authored by the co-chairs of the committee -- state Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) and state Rep. Robin Vos (R-Rochester) -- would have rolled back the ban on rule violators, which covers the vast majority of those fired.

After pressure from Milwaukee officials, who noted the 2009 police pay change had saved city taxpayers $283,300, Republican Gov. Scott Walker vetoed the provision on June 26, 2011.

Among those who urged him to veto it: Darling.

Her opponent in a recall election, state Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Whitefish Bay) called it an ""astonishing"" flip-flop.

Was it?

Yes, time again to roll out the Flip-O-Meter. A reminder: It does not examine whether a change in position is a good one from a political or a policy perspective.  It just measures whether a person has been consistent.

Let’s briefly recap Darling’s position on the question of pay for fired Milwaukee police officers.

She was a co-sponsor, along with Vos, of the amendment that was added to the budget June 2, 2011. At the time, Vos claimed the Milwaukee police chief could fire officers for ""basically no cause."" We rated that claim False.

Vos has said his information on the fired police matter came from officials with the Milwaukee Police Association, which has about 1,800 members.

Once the amendment was adopted by the committee, and then by the Legislature (with Darling arguing for it on the Senate floor), Milwaukee officials pushed for a veto.

Under the system, they said, the amendment would have guaranteed fired officers at least 60 days additional pay and benefits while they appealed. Officers in some cases have stretched out the process much longer.

The 2009 police pay change has saved Milwaukee taxpayers $283,300 to date, according to Michael Tobin, executive director of the city's Fire and Police Commission. Since then, eight officers have been fired by Chief Edward Flynn for rule violations.

In the course of the discussion, Darling said she changed her mind after looking into the matter in greater depth. Darling said fired cops were treated more fairly than she had been led to believe.

Said Darling: ""There’s a lot more due process and coordination between the chief and the Fire and Police Commission.""

Vos has said he will introduce a bill this fall to strip the Milwaukee police chief’s power to fire officers. He said it’s part of an effort to streamline the way cops are treated across the state. Chiefs in other jurisdictions suspend officers, and the local commission determines whether or not to fire them.

""I told Robin that he needs to talk with Mr. Tobin,"" Darling said. ""A lot has changed.""

On June 26, 2011, Walker vetoed the provision when he signed the two-year budget.

Darling acknowledged she sought a veto of an amendment she co-sponsored.

That’s a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A71340>],/factchecks/2011/jun/28/alberta-darling/pay-fired-milwaukee-police-officers-Darling-does-/

Weatherford denies $30 million pot exists for redistricting
","
Redistricting will be a messy battle in 2012. And that means legislators need money to protect their turf. But how much have they set aside to wage the war?

The Orlando Sentinel has reported that the House set aside $30 million that can be used for redistricting and to fight potential lawsuits. But state Rep. Will Weatherford, the House redistricting chairman and a Republican from Wesley Chapel, rejected that claim while speaking at a public legislative redistricting meeting in Panama City. 
""There is no $30 million pot of money. That doesn't exist,"" Weatherford, the House speaker designate, told the June 22, 2011, audience. ""Your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that. There is no large pot of money out there that is fighting anything.""

Several readers saw the Sentinel's reporting and the response from Weatherford and asked us to look into it.

First, a quick primer on redistricting.

Every 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. The task seems simple enough: to logically divide Florida's 18.8 million residents into 120 House districts, 40 Senate districts and 27 congressional districts. But the process is never without accusations of ""gerrymandering"" often brought up against the party in power.

This round of redistricting, however, could be even more contentious because of two constitutional amendments approved by voters in 2010 that require districts to be drawn in a way that doesn't favor incumbents or political parties or interfere with minority representation. Some lawmakers say the amendments are vaguely worded and are open to interpretation, meaning that any redrawing of district lines will be open to a legal challenge.

Expecting lawsuits, legislators have been storing away discretionary tax dollars to fight potential legal challenges.

The Sentinel's Aaron Deslatte has been writing about the Legislature's plans and is the source for the $30 million figure. Specifically, Deslatte identified two House discretionary funds -- one with $8.49 million available and another with about $23 million available. (The Senate has set aside about $9 million, according to multiple reports).

Deslatte asked House Speaker Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, about the funds in May, and reported that the reserves had been allowed to accumulate in part because the chamber would need money — millions of dollars — to pay for the redistricting fight. ""The problem with redistricting every decade is it's unpredictable. The litigation this year is likely to be more broad and complex than it has been in past decades,"" Cannon said.

Through June, the House had spent $945,843 on law firms associated with redistricting, Deslatte reported.

Yet, despite the Sentinel stories, and quote from Cannon -- Weatherford is now challenging the dollar figure.

Why?

Weatherford told us that the problem is suggesting those moneys are specifically earmarked for redistricting.

""Those resources are in two different areas, they are not earmarked for redistricting purposes,"" he said. ""Will those pots be utilized for redistricting costs? I believe they will, but that's not the only thing they will be for.""

Weatherford's right that neither fund has shiny, bold-faced type linking it to redistricting. The funds are called ""Legislative Carry Forward"" and ""House Discretionary Budget."" But we believe he's also underplaying their intent.

• Of the $8.49 million in the ""Legislative Carry Forward"" fund, about $571,000 has been spent -- including $18,932 for the redistricting committee. The fund includes small allotments for House members, but the biggest chunk of the money -- nearly $8 million -- is available in a ""General House"" fund that is available to be used on redistricting. (The redistricting committee has no specific allotment.)

• Of the $23 million in the ""House Discretionary Budget"", about $700,000 has been spent so far on house reapportionment, and most of the money is not allocated for any specific use. 
Cannon himself admits that the funds were bolstered in order to fend off redistricting challenges. 
Which makes Weatherford's other claim that ""your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that"" -- simply not true. (Weatherford told us he wasn't trying to suggest that there are zero dollars for redistricting.)

Part of the problem in examining this claim is that the Sentinel's stories got somewhat lost in translation. The Sentinel never said there was a bank vault filled with money sealed behind a door with ""Redistricting Only"" written on it. But Weatherford, in responding to allegations, was able to suggest as much.

And that's what makes his claim -- at least part of it -- credible. There is, in fact, no $30 million pot of money for redistricting in the House. There are two pots of money available for lots of things, but the House speaker said the money predominantly is available to fight potential redistricting lawsuits. That admission, which is not in dispute, defies Weatherford's other point, that ""your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that"" -- referring to redistricting lawsuits. The Legislature is planning on doing exactly that. There's too much about this claim that is missing. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4BF4C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/28/will-weatherford/weatherford-denies-30-million-pot-exists-redistric/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Democratic Party of Virginia']","
Democrats say Bob McDonnell tried to raid education to pay for roads
","
David Mills, executive director of the state Democratic Party, recently sent out a fundraising appeal urging party loyalists to take a stand against a variety of efforts by state and national Republicans. 

Among the alleged GOP offenses, Mills listed ""Bob McDonnell’s raid on public education to pay for roads.""

We wondered if the Republican governor really took money out of classrooms and spent it on roads.

McDonnell rolled out an extensive $4 billion transportation plan last December that was approved by the General Assembly earlier this year. Most of the money will come from the acceleration of previously approved state borrowing and the use of bonds backed by the federal government. The governor also proposed diverting $150 million from the state’s 2010 budget surplus into transportation projects.

Mills’ claim is based on a second, less-publicized transportation initiative by McDonnell, according to Brian Coy, director of communications for the state Democratic Party. The governor proposed diverting about $140 million in sales tax revenue from Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. The cash, instead of flowing into the state’s general fund, would be used for projects in the two congested regions. The measure died in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Virginia’s general fund -- estimated at $16.5 billion for the budget year starting July 1 -- receives revenue from income taxes, some sales taxes, contract fees, and profits from the state-run liquor stores. Of the proceeds, about 40 percent goes to education, 30 percent to health and human services, and 10 percent to public safety. The rest is divided up among smaller programs. Transportation gets a little from the general fund, but the vast majority of road revenues come from other sources.

Because public schools are the largest recipient of general fund money, Coy said the governor’s effort divert more of its revenues to transportation was tantamount to a direct raid on education. If the $140 million had been removed evenly from the various programs the fund supports, schools stood to lose $54 million. That would have been less that 1 percent of the $6.6 billion public education budget for the budget year stating July 1.

Of course the General Assembly could also have chosen to cut the $140 million from other programs and leave education untouched. But given that a high percentage of money from the fund goes to education, Democrats say it would be virtually impossible to cut from the fund without taking some education money.

The Democrats also cite McDonnell’s successful proposal to move $150 million in surplus money from the fiscal 2010 budget year into transportation. That money could have gone to education, but surplus dollars -- unlike general fund revenues -- are not reserved for schools or other specific programs. Lawmakers spend surpluses as they see fit.

Jeff Caldwell, McDonnell’s press secretary, sent us a 106-page list of the services and activities receiving support from the general fund. The inference is that the Democrats are oversimplifying their case when they say moving money from the fund means taking it away from education.

Let’s review.

Mills, the executive director of the state Democratic Party, says McDonnell tried to ""raid education to pay for roads.""

""Raid"" is a loaded word. It suggests a hostile intent on the governor’s part.

McDonnell unsuccessfully proposed diverting about $140 million of sales tax revenue a year from the state’s general fund to transportation projects. The money would have come from Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, then spent on road projects in those areas.

About 40 percent of the state’s General Fund dollars go to education each year, so if the $140 million were removed proportionally across all programs, schools would have lost about $54 million -- less that 1 percent of the annual appropriation. But the General Assembly, had it approved McDonnell’s plan, could have decided to remove the money from other programs supported. There was no guarantee the money would have been diverted from education.

Realistically, it would have been very difficult to remove the cash without impacting education. And McDonnell, in making his proposal, never tried to protect schools from the fallout.

We rate Mills’ statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9ABC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/28/democratic-party-virginia/democrats-say-bob-mcdonnell-tried-raid-education-p/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Taxes', 'Jim DeMint']","
Jim DeMint says federal government has more revenue coming in ""than we ever have""
","
On the June 26, 2011, edition of CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., supported the decision by Republican budget negotiators to keep tax increases off the table.

Two leading congressional Republicans -- House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. -- pulled out of bipartisan talks on how to avoid federal debt exceeding a congressionally approved limit. If no action is taken and the debt limit is exceeded in August, the U.S. could be viewed as defaulting on its obligations, which could in turn trigger wider economic difficulties.

CNN host Candy Crowley asked DeMint -- a leader of fiscal conservatives in the Senate -- ""Why shouldn't we just look at this and say it is another giant game of ‘chicken’ by our legislators?""

DeMint responded, ""Well, we've got more revenue than we ever have. We're spending more than we ever have. We don't -- we don't have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. The government is doing things that we can't do well. We're wasting billions of dollars. And we're not going to address that waste and fraud until we have to.""

A reader asked us whether the federal government currently has ""more revenue than we ever have."" So we decided to take a look.

We turned to historical data tables from the Office of Management and Budget. First, we looked at raw dollars for federal receipts for fiscal years going back to 1901. These numbers primarily include revenue from federal taxes, though a small portion includes money from tariffs and other sources.

For fiscal year 2010 -- the last year for which final numbers are available -- federal revenue totaled $2.16 trillion. The figure for fiscal year 2011, which is a projection, is $2.17 trillion.

But neither is the highest in U.S. history. Three other years exceeded both years’ figures -- 2006 (with $2.41 trillion in receipts), 2007 (with $2.57 trillion) and 2008 (with $2.52 trillion).

But raw figures aren’t even the best measurement, since they take no account of the size of the economy as a whole. As the nation’s economy grows over the long term, receipts tend to go up -- and over the long term, the economy, as measured by gross domestic product, has grown dramatically, making raw-number comparisons over time problematic.

OMB also offers a historical table for receipts as a share of GDP. And this yardstick makes the inaccuracy of DeMint’s statement even clearer.

In fiscal year 2010, federal receipts accounted for 14.9 percent of GDP, a number that’s projected to fall to 14.4 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2011.

To find a level lower than that, you have to go back to the days of the Korean War, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the gray flannel suit. In 1950, federal receipts as a percentage of GDP amounted to 14.4 percent. During the subsequent six decades, the share typically hovered between 16 percent and 20 percent.

When we contacted DeMint’s office, spokesman Wesley Denton said the absolute levels of federal tax revenues collected in many of the most recent years have been at or near record levels, even if it wasn’t the case for 2010.

""It is absolutely clear that recent years have seen the highest tax revenues on record, but our spending has skyrocketed even more,"" Denton said. ""If spending were today at 2003 spending levels, hardly a time of miserly spending, we'd be running a surplus instead of a deficit."" (We checked Denton’s 2003 comparison, and he’s correct.)

Still, for the specific statement DeMint made on CNN -- which is the claim that we’re checking -- DeMint was wrong using either standard. He was off by a few years using raw dollar figures. And when you use tax revenue as a share of gross domestic product -- which is a better yardstick for this sort of comparison -- he was off by six decades. So we rate DeMint’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0944C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/28/jim-demint/jim-demint-says-federal-government-has-more-revenu/

DCCC says Rep. Jim Renacci plan would jeopardize nursing home care
","
The ""Path to Prosperity"" budget document that Republicans in the House of Representatives adopted in April has become a path to propaganda for Democrats who are using the proposals it contains in an effort to discredit its Republican supporters.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blitzed the media June 8 with news  releases that claimed particular GOP congressmen who voted for the plan would jeopardize nursing home care for senior citizens in their district.

One targeted freshman Rep. Jim Renacci from Ohio’s 16th Congressional District.

""Rep. Jim Renacci’s plan to end Medicare also puts nursing home care for 3,000 seniors in the district in immediate jeopardy,"" the news release said. It asserted the ""Republican-Renacci plan"" might force grandma ""to move out of the nursing home because families can no longer afford her long-term care.""

This seemed like an odd claim to make about Renacci, an entrepreneur who built a personal fortune of more than $30 million through businesses that included a chain of nursing homes. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

A popular soundbite has been to label the GOP plan as a plan to kill Medicare. This claim, though, also ties in nursing home care funded by Medicaid.

Medicaid is the nation’s largest payer for nursing home care, bankrolling 64 percent of nursing home patients and 13 percent of assisted living residents, according to the American Health Care Association, a trade group for the nursing home industry.

The Republican plan would convert the federal share of Medicaid into block grants. Republicans say that would maximize states’ flexibility to focus benefits on specific needs. Presently, the only option for states to reduce costs, they say, is across-the-board cuts in reimbursements to doctors, which leads to fewer doctors willing to see Medicaid patients.

The GOP budget would initially give states the same allotment for Medicaid they get today, only in block grant form. The change would start in 2013. The amount would grow each year to account for inflation and population. However, Medicaid expenditures would not grow as much as they would under current law.

In support of their claim, The DCCC referred us to a series of reports produced by Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which aim to break down the district-by-district impact the GOP budget would have on Medicare and Medicaid.

Democrats contend the GOP proposal, with its new flexibility for the states, would mean that states no longer have to abide by current federal requirements for the money’s use, thus jeopardizing nursing home care. The Medicaid report for Renacci's district says 3,000 constituents have nursing home care paid by Medicaid, a figure it got from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal spending for Medicaid under the House GOP plan would be 35 percent lower in 2022 and 49 percent lower in 2030 than it would be if the program was left alone.

Its implementation would keep federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP - the Children’s Health Insurance Program - under 6 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product, rather than having it rise to around 12 or 14 percent, as would be expected under current scenarios.

This would make Medicaid funding more predictable from a federal perspective, but it would lead to greater uncertainty for states as to whether the federal contribution would be sufficient during periods of economic weakness. Federal payments for Medicaid under the proposal would also be substantially smaller than currently projected amounts, the CBO says, although states might be able to achieve greater efficiencies with the flexibility provided by the changes.

Both AHCA and AARP fear that converting Medicaid to a block grant program would have negative effects on nursing home patients. An issue brief from the nursing home group says block grants ""threaten care for frail seniors and the disabled.""

Whether nursing home care would continue to be paid for by Medicaid would be up to individual states if the program is converted to a block grant, AARP state government relations director JoAnn Lamphere said in an interview.

""If you recognize that the bulk of Medicaid spending goes to nursing homes, you would have to conclude that nursing homes would be severely impacted,"" Lamphere said.

So where does that leave the DCCC’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter?
  
  
There is an element of truth to the DCCC claim, but it also ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. The DCCC packs a lot of misinformation into a single sentence.

"['Georgia', 'Civil Rights', 'History', 'Al Roker']","
Who's right? Cities lay claim to civil rights ""cradle"" mantle.
","
You hear it all the time in Atlanta.

Atlanta, many politicians, preachers and others say, is ""the cradle of the civil rights movement.""

Former mayor Bill Campbell said it. So has entertainer Debbie Allen. One-time Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau president Spurgeon Richardson claimed the title for the city.

So we were quite surprised when NBC ""Today Show"" meteorologist Al Roker, who was visiting Birmingham for a charity program, referred to that city as ""the cradle of the civil rights movement.""

The city of Birmingham’s website says many refer to it as the cradle of the movement.  

We decided to go back in time for some answers.

Atlanta was the birthplace of the movement’s most recognizable leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his leading partners. Atlanta was also home to the movement’s leading organizations, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, whose former chairman is longtime U.S. Rep. John Lewis, (D-Atlanta).

Birmingham was the stage for some of the most important moments of the movement. The city’s public safety director, Eugene ""Bull"" Connor, a defiant segregationist, infamously ordered firemen to spray young protesters with water hoses. King, who referred to Birmingham as the most ""segregated city"" in America, targeted the city for his non-violent campaign because of the stubbornness of its leaders to evolve on civil rights. Some called the Alabama city ""Bombingham."" It was there, in 1963, that four black girls (ages 11-14) were killed by a bomb in a church on a Sunday morning.

Most civil rights historians say the church bombing was the tipping point in public opinion of civil rights for blacks that resulted in federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 that desegregated public facilities, granted blacks the right to vote and prohibited job discrimination.

So does that make Birmingham the ""cradle"" of the movement?

NBC thought so after doing some research, said spokeswoman Megan Kopf.

""Other cities may be considered that as well, but since we were broadcasting from Birmingham, that is the city we mentioned,"" she said.

Some well-regarded civil rights historians say another Alabama city may have a stronger claim.

""I honestly think if we assembled 30 civil rights historians and said if you had to name one place to call the cradle of the movement, I think Montgomery would get 75 percent of the vote and I think Birmingham would finish second,"" said David Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning civil rights historian who served as an advisor for the acclaimed ""Eyes On The Prize"" documentary series about the movement.

Montgomery was the setting of the historic 381-day boycott to integrate the city’s bus system. It began in late 1955 after NAACP member Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. The Montgomery argument is based on the definition of a cradle (""The earliest stage,"" according to Webster’s) and the boycott is widely considered the beginning of the modern civil rights movement. Garrow said he’d vote for Montgomery.

""Montgomery is the cradle because of the bus boycott,"" said Taylor Branch, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who has written extensively about King and the movement.

Branch said Birmingham played a critical role in the movement. Birmingham was a tough steel town that was considered a bastion of segregation and considered a ""gamble"" for King. The battles there, Branch said, gave momentum to the 1963 March on Washington.

""It is fair to say historically that Birmingham was a tipping point, a breakthrough for the national civil rights movement,"" he said.

What about Atlanta?

Atlanta, the historians and others noted, had only a handful of demonstrations and none were as acrimonious, violent or as transformational as Birmingham or Montgomery.

""Atlanta finishes third,"" Garrow said.

Steve Kline, spokesman for the King Center, said a valid argument can be made for Atlanta, as well as Birmingham and Montgomery. He noted the efforts of King’s father to get equal pay for the city’s black teachers a few years before the Montgomery bus boycott. Kline also mentioned the SCLC and that its first meeting was held in Atlanta.

""You could make a good, strong case for Atlanta in some way,"" Kline said.

Georgette M. Norman, director of the Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery, made a slight distinction in the claim for the title.

""We don’t use cradle,"" she said. ""We use birthplace of the modern civil rights movement.""

Norman said the museum makes that distinction because of the efforts made by others toward racial equality in the decades before the bus boycott. In Montgomery, for example, activists like E. D. Nixon had previously been engaged in civil rights efforts there. Nixon helped organized the bus boycott.

Norman believes some refer to Birmingham as the cradle of the movement because of the 1963 church bombing. But if she had to choose which city is the ""cradle""?

""I’d say it’s Montgomery,"" Norman said. ""That became the first sustainable movement and things moved on from there.""

Some say they’ve heard a cradle argument for Greensboro, N.C., where college students staged sit-ins in 1960 to protest not being served at ""whites only"" lunch counters and other locations.

""I think it’s great for people to argue and take credit because the debate fosters history,"" Branch told us.

Roker’s visit to Birmingham was a good cause on several levels. He raised money for charity and, as Branch observed, sparked a conversation among us about an important period in American history. NBC said its research showed Birmingham is the cradle.

However, the consensus we found is that the ""cradle"" title more likely belongs to Montgomery. We rate Roker’s statement as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097919680>],/factchecks/2011/jun/28/al-roker/whos-right-cities-lay-claim-civil-rights-cradle-ma/

A day after conducting a committee hearing on threats to rail security, Lautenberg (D-NJ) was asked by a reporter for ABC’s Top Line about whether Congress would seriously deal with rail security.

Lautenberg said Congress was ""not really paying the kind of attention that … it needs. Since 2004, there have been some 1,300 attacks. Four thousand people have died. Thousands of injuries, and how can we ignore that when these areas are susceptible to terrorist inclinations?""

Given that the interview was about how Congress would deal with rail security, it sounded like Lautenberg was saying there had been about 1,300 attacks on trains in America over the last seven years. Could that be right?

Lautenberg spokeswoman Gail Ribas told PolitiFact New Jersey that the senator was referring to ""the number of worldwide attacks on rail."" She said Lautenberg’s statistics came from the California-based Mineta Transportation Institute, which was created by Congress in 1991.

We knew the senator’s numbers were off when we received the following data from Brian Michael Jenkins, an authority on terrorism at the Mineta Institute and director of the National Transportation Security Center of Excellence:

Between January 2004 and May 22, 2011, there were 717 attacks worldwide on railway tracks, bridges and tunnels; passenger trains; passenger train stations; and freight trains or stations. Those attacks caused 1,073 deaths and 5,641 injuries.

The Mineta Institute statistics don’t include incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Asked about the discrepancy over the figures, Caley Gray, Lautenberg’s communications director, said Ribas made a mistake and that Lautenberg was referring to the Mineta Institute’s research on bus and rail attacks worldwide since 2004.

When attacks on buses and bus stations or stops are added, Lautenberg’s statement about ""1,300 attacks"" is accurate, but the senator is still off on the number of fatalities. According to Jenkins, 1,295 attacks occurred on those bus and rail targets combined since 2004, causing 2,886 deaths.

If we look at bus and rail attacks between Sept. 11, 2001 and May 22, 2011, the number of fatalities climbs to 3,858, which is closer to Lautenberg’s estimate. Gray told PolitiFact New Jersey that the senator’s statement excluded incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In an emailed statement, Gray said: ""The Senator used data about mass transit, which includes train and bus attacks. The fact is, we know our mass transit network is a tempting target for terrorists, and we have to stay vigilant and provide the resources to protect it.""

Here’s the problem: Lautenberg might have meant to say bus and rail attacks worldwide, but there was no mention of buses during the ABC interview. The senator also didn’t specify that these attacks occurred across the world.

The entire discussion was about ""rail security"" and what U.S. officials were doing about it, leaving viewers with the impression that the senator was solely referring to rail attacks in America.

But Lautenberg’s overall point during the interview is on target -- there is an ongoing threat of terrorism against rail systems.

At that committee hearing -- where Lautenberg led the meeting -- experts testified that rail networks remain a target for terrorism, particularly because of the open nature of how they’re structured.

Mia Bloom, a fellow at the International Center for the Study of Terrorism at the Pennsylvania State University, said in an email that since New Jersey doesn’t have a metro system, trains are a more viable target.

""I think many people on rail in the U.S. are not expecting an attack and thus without scanners and X-rays and other security measures, from a terrorists' perspective, rail is more (of) a low hanging fruit,"" Bloom wrote in the email.

Back to Lautenberg’s statement, let’s review:

During an interview about ""rail security,"" Lautenberg said about 1,300 attacks had occurred since 2004, killing 4,000 people. But the senator never specified -- as his representatives would later clarify -- that he was referring to bus and rail attacks worldwide.

When we look at rail attacks, the actual number of attacks is 717. If bus attacks are factored in, the senator is right about the number of total attacks, but still off on the number of fatalities.

Lautenberg’s larger point about the terrorist threat against rail systems may be correct, but because of the various mistakes he made in presenting attack statistics, we rate the senator’s claim Barely True.

Transit CEO says Rhode Island bus fares are among most expensive in New England
","
With the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority facing a projected $4.6- million budget shortfall in the coming year, CEO Charles Odimgbe told his board of directors that bus service would have to be cut 10 percent.

He ruled out raising fares, something the board has done five times since 2002.

""We are one of the most expensive rides in New England,"" Odimgbe told the board members during the meeting.

Does a ticket to ride cost more in Rhode Island? We decided to find out.

When we reached Odimgbe, he said he based his statement on knowledge of the industry. He later had a RIPTA employee forward an internal survey. He qualified the remark he made to his board, saying it’s more relevant to compare RIPTA to transit systems that are comparably sized and in areas with a comparable cost of living than to simply look toward other systems in New England.

If you did look to Boston or New York for a comparison and took into consideration their higher cost of living, ""you will come to the conclusion that the rides in Rhode Island are very high,"" he said.

We’re not sure why cost of living should be a factor, so we focused only on how much it costs to ride the bus.

In Rhode Island, the fare for riding a RIPTA bus is $2 one way. Need to transfer to another bus? That costs another 50 cents. Ride frequently? You can get a one-day pass for $6 and a monthly pass for $62. Some people, including seniors, disabled, low-income and students, can ride for free or for half price.

[Of the 18.2 million rides RIPTA provided during the past 12 months, about 4.2 million, or one-quarter, were seniors and disabled people who hold free passes -- they number 40,000 -- and another 2 million were students with passes, according to assistant general manager Mark Therrien.]

By comparison, in Boston, the base bus fare is $1.50, or 25 cents less with a pre-paid Charlie Card. A monthly local pass costs $40.

Let’s look at some other transit systems in New England. In Portland, Maine, the fare is $1.50, with a monthly pass costing $45.

The Worcester Regional Transit Authority charges $1.50, with monthly passes going for $48.  In Burlington, Vt., the fare for a public bus is $1.25, with a monthly pass costing $42. Connecticut Transit, serving Hartford and New Haven among other communities, charges $1.25, with free transfers.

RIPTA’s internal survey draws a comparison with a handful of comparable, or ""peer"" systems outside of New England. Fares were reported from last summer, but we went to their individual websites and updated those that have changed. In cities such as Albany, Rochester, Memphis, and Louisville, basic fares were lower than RIPTA’s.

So far, Odimgbe’s claim seems to be holding up.

But comparing only base fares doesn’t give a complete picture of what it costs to ride a bus in any of these systems. And this is where Odimgbe’s claim begins to break down.

In Rhode Island, there’s one basic fare, no matter how many miles you travel -- whether it’s within Providence city limits or between outlying communities and the capital city. Get on a bus in Westerly and it will carry you the 43 miles to Providence, all for just $2. Get a transfer for another 50 cents and you could then head to Woonsocket, another 15 miles.

[Odimgbe said the agency has concluded that because most RIPTA riders travel within urban areas -- an estimated 85 percent of rides within 7 miles of downtown Providence -- it would not be worth creating a system to charge long-distance riders more.]

You’re not going to travel those long distances in Connecticut that cheaply.  Express bus service between Hartford and outlying areas is based on zone fares that range from from $2.25 to $4.30.

For example, if you board a bus in Old Saybrook or New Haven and travel the 40-plus miles to Hartford, the fare is $4.30, more than double Rhode Island’s fare for a comparable distance.

Boston, meanwhile, has higher fares for its Inner Express ($3.50) and Outer Express ($5) services.

Let’s make one last stop before we arrive at our destination. The American Public Transportation Association, whose members include RIPTA and 350 other transit systems conducts an annual survey of base fares for adults. Of those that responded to the 2010 survey, only four U.S. systems charged more than RIPTA, ranging from $2.25 in San Diego to $3.65 in San Francisco.

So what have we learned during our ride? When we confined our comparison to New England, just as Odimgbe stated, we could not find another bus system charging as much as RIPTA’s $2 base fare. And while several of these do not charge to transfer to other buses, RIPTA tacks on another 50 cents. RIPTA’s monthly pass also is substantially higher.

However, while RIPTA lets patrons travel all the way across the state for no more than $2.50,  riders in Boston and Connecticut have to pay substantially more to travel comparable distances.

So, Odimgbe’s claim that RIPTA is ""one of the most expensive rides in New England"" is true for base fares, but not when it comes to longer trips. Because 85 percent of RIPTA riders pay the base fare, we rate his claim MostlyTrue.

Michele Bachmann claims federal limousines up 73 percent under Obama
","
In an interview on CBS' Face the Nation on June 26, 2011, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann managed to turn a question about farm subsidies into an attack on President Barack Obama's administration for a ""reprehensible"" increase in the number of federal limousines.

""What about farm subsidies?"" host Bob Schieffer asked Bachmann on the eve of her formal announcement of a 2012 presidential bid. ""...Do you think we ought to think about cutting those back?""

""I think everything needs to be on the table right now, every part of government,"" Bachmann said. ""I'll tell you one thing that should be on the table, under Barack Obama the last two years, the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased 73 percent, in two years. I can’t think of anything more reprehensible than seeing bureaucrats on their cell phones in the backs...73 percent increase in the number of federal limousines in the last two years, for heaven's sake."" 
She made a similar statement during an appearance in New Hampshire on June 28: ""In the last two years under the Obama administration, the number of federal limousines have increased 73 percent under President Obama. So if it isn't bad enough that we have all these czars, now they have limousines at their service and they can sit in their back seats and talk on their cell phones. This is the level of waste we've got in Washington, DC."" 
The claim is based on a May 31, 2011, story from iWatchNews.org, a project of the Center for Public Integrity, which ran under the headline, ""Limousine liberals? Number of government-owned limos has soared under Obama.""

The story, written by Joe Eaton, begins: ""Limousines, the very symbol of wealth and excess, are usually the domain of corporate executives and the rich. But the number of limos owned by Uncle Sam increased by 73 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration, according to an analysis of records by iWatch News.""

The statistic is based on annual fleet reports provided by the U.S. General Services Administration. According to the Fleet Report for Fiscal Year 2010 (Table 2-5 and 2-5T), the number of federal limousines by year went from 318 in 2006; to 217 in 2007; to 238 in 2008; to 349 in 2009; and to 412 in 2010. So the data suggests there was a 73 percent increase between 2008 and 2010.

But information in the iWatch News article itself casts doubt about whether this is a firm statistic and whether the increase is rightly pegged entirely to the Obama administration.

For starters, the GSA itself is not standing behind the numbers. Because of a loose definition of ""limousines,"" GSA spokeswoman Sara Merriam told iWatch News that GSA ""cannot say that its report accurately reflects the number of limousines."" 

""The categories in the Fleet Report are overly broad, and the term 'limousine' is not defined,"" Merriam told us via e-mail. ""Vehicles represented as limousines can range from protective duty vehicles to common sedans, and many of these vehicles serve in a law enforcement or protective capacity. This is a flaw in the report that GSA will fix to ensure that the Fleet Report can serve as a useful tool to help agencies right-size their fleets to achieve cost and energy savings as directed by the Presidential Memorandum."" 

The iWatch News report noted that according to GSA, ""law enforcement"" limousines means the vehicles ""are equipped with sirens or lights, high-performance drivetrains or are used for surveillance or undercover operations."" 

Indeed, the data shows that the number of ""law enforcement"" limousines went from 193 in 2008  to 288 in 2010. In other words, limos used for law enforcement accounted for 95 of the new limousines (more than half the entire increase).

Law enforcement vehicles with sirens and used for surveillance or undercover operations, didn't jibe with our concept of limousine. So we went to our Merriam-Webster dictionary, which defines limousine as ""a large luxurious often chauffeur-driven sedan that usually has a glass partition separating the driver's seat from the passenger compartment.""

It's also unclear how many of the new ""limousines"" can be tied to the Obama administration. The bulk of the limousine fleet increase occurred between the fiscal years of 2008 and 2009 (when the number jumped 47 percent -- from 238 to 349). When Obama took office in late January 2009, it was already nearly four months into the 2009 fiscal year. The GSA report doesn't note how many were ordered in the first four months as opposed to the final eight.

Moreover, the GSA's fleet acquisition data notes when vehicles were delivered, not when they were ordered. A bulk of the vehicles in the FY2009 report would have been ordered in 2008 under the prior Bush administration (and a Democrat-controlled Congress).

The iWatch News story also notes that much of the increase in the fleet of limousines was in the State Department.

""The State Department in a statement said its limos are deployed by overseas diplomats and in the United States by Secretary of State Clinton and 'distinguished foreign visitors,'"" the story states. ""Many of the limos in its fleet are armored to protect against attack. The department said its Obama-era increase in armored limos is 'both in proportion to the increased threat to diplomats serving overseas and is in proportion to the increase number of diplomats we have serving in high threat environments.' Appropriations documents indicate the State Department was engaged in a longer-term effort to increase the number of armored vehicles that would have stretched back to at least 2007.""

In other words, some of the State Department increase has been in the works for at least two years prior to Obama taking office.

Accusing the Obama administration of significantly increasing the federal limousine fleet in the midst of a recession and spiraling deficits may make for a great red meat line on a Republican campaign stop. But Bachmann's claim that ""under Barack Obama the last two years the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased 73 percent,"" is based on squishy figures from the GSA (according to the GSA itself). And it's also impossible to tell from the numbers exactly how many of the new ""limousines"" were ordered by the Obama administration, and how many were ordered by his predecessor. Given those qualifiers, we rate it Barely True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809688CB00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-federal-limousines-73-perc/
