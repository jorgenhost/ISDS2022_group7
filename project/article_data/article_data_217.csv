Is the new St. Pete police station under budget and ahead of schedule?
","Rick Baker has accused Mayor Rick Kriseman of spending wildly on a new police station, saying it's $35 million over budget. Kriseman, in contrast, says the project is actually under budget. ""We’ve got a police station that’s under construction right now, they are actually ahead of schedule and under budget,"" Kriseman told Beauty & The ‘Burg, a podcast on LifeImprovementRadio.com, on Aug. 9. That makes two competing narratives about the police station from the two leading candidates in the Aug. 29 mayoral primary. We wondered who was right — is the new police headquarters under budget, over budget, or none of the above? The upshot: It’s simply too soon to say anything about the budget and timeline for the construction of the new police department building. For over a decade, there have been plans to replace the city’s police building on 1300 First Ave. N. The old headquarters was built in multiple parts. The east side of the police station was opened in 1951 and it included a jail and additional space for police operations. The building on the west side was opened in 1978. Eventually, the jail located inside the east side building was shut down and inmates were sent to the Pinellas County jail. It was not until 2015 that Kriseman announced there was enough money to construct a new police headquarters. St. Petersburg plans to spend about $86 million on new police facilities. That includes $79 million for the headquarters and $6.5 million for a new shooting range. The building will be 167,500 square-feet and able to withstand a Category 4 hurricane. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new headquarters was in late April 2017. City officials estimated the project will be done in December 2018, and fully operational in spring 2019. Not really. The basis for Kriseman’s comment was the possibility of the city not tapping into a $1.4 million contingency fund for unexpected costs.   ""The mayor's remarks were based on conversations with staff, who informed him that things are progressing well, no surprises, and that there is a chance we may not need all the contingency money and could finish under budget,"" said spokesman Ben Kirby. ""But there is a long way to go."" City architect Raul Quintana said the amount of contingency dollars fluctuates during various points of the project. ""Generally, the earlier we are in a project and the greater the unknowns, then the higher the project contingency,"" Quintana said.   Despite the possibility of not needing this money, Quintana said the nature of the project is very complicated, so the city plans to keep the contingency money in play. So, only four months in, it’s too soon to say the project is under budget with certainty. The construction contract with the Construction Manager is a little more than $61 million and the city has spent about $4 million. As for the timeline, Quintana said the project was ahead of schedule by at least three weeks and said he ""feels good"" about how the project has progressed. But with so much time to go, there are some factors that could affect the timeline, such as the weather. For the record, Baker's point that the project is massively over budget is also misleading. We're fact-checking what he said about the new police station in a separate fact-check to come. Baker’s campaign argued that Kriseman’s remarks were directly contradicted by reporting on the police station. They sent three news articles that allude to how the costs and plans have evolved over the years. But the stories don't refer to the project as either over budget. Here's what happened: In 2006, with Baker as mayor, the original estimate to replace the police station came in at $50 million. As the economic downturn set in, the city looked at other options, including building a scaled-down version while making updates to the old facility. However, after the economy picked back up, Kriseman announced the city would have enough money to build a new station again for $70 million.  Jeff Forrest, the president of Winter Park Construction in Maitland, Fla., and someone used to handling big construction projects said it’s too premature to make claims about a project of this size being under or over budget. Same goes for the timeline. ""If I was building a project I would never communicate that early in a job because there’s just too many unknowns,"" Forrest said. ""There’s too many opportunities just to easily lose that time."" He said there are a number of challenges including labor shortages in the construction industry and Florida’s volatile weather that could affect the timeline and costs of a project. ""We can all be optimistic. I’m an optimistic person, but I’m a realistic person when it comes to building and recognizing the challenges that exist,"" he said. Kriseman said construction on the new police station is ""ahead of schedule and under budget."" In reality, there is no definitive evidence that supports Kriseman’s claim about being under budget, and the city’s architect estimates that the project is three weeks ahead of schedule. The most important thing to note in this check is the that the police station still has a long way to go and the progress could change. So any claims about the project being over or under budget or ahead of schedule are too premature. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A0680>],/factchecks/2017/aug/24/rick-kriseman/new-st-pete-police-station-under-budget-and-ahead-/

Viral post gets it wrong about extent of slavery in 1860
","Confederate-themed posts are cropping up on social media in the wake of the Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Va. The march was sparked by efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and included some marchers carrying Confederate symbols. One viral post sent to us by a reader said, ""At the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year."" The post is signed, ""Proud Southern Deplorable - Southern Rebel"" and goes on to say, ""If you're sick of the race baiting, please LIKE and SHARE.""   When we took a closer look, we found that the percentage of slaveholding families was dramatically higher than what the meme said, and that the number of slaves owned by blacks was presented in a misleading way. The primary source of data about slaves and slaveholding in 1860 is that year’s census. Census data from 1860 isn’t perfect, said University of North Carolina historian Joseph T. Glatthaar, author of Soldiering in the Army of Northern Virginia: A Statistical Portrait of the Troops Who Served under Robert E. Lee. But it remains ""the best evidence we have."" In the big picture, the 1860 Census counted a total of 31,443,321 people, of which 3,953,760 were slaves. So slaves accounted for 12.6 percent of the national population. However, to address the assertion in the post requires more detailed data. Many states had outlawed slavery by 1860, so the national population figure dilutes the measurement by including many Americans whose states did not allow them to own slaves. The national population figure also includes slaves and children, and it doesn’t account either for family groupings or how many slaves a given family owned. So experts say that a more accurate measure of slaveholding in 1860 America would focus on states that allowed slavery, and would zero in on family or household units, as a way of limiting the statistical noise caused by counting slaves and children. ""The number that really matters is how many American households in the South had slaves,"" said Adam Goodheart, a Washington College historian and author of 1861: The Civil War Awakening.  Using Census data to research his book, Glatthaar calculated that 4.9 percent of people in the slaveholding states owned slaves, that 19.9 percent of family units in those states owned slaves, and that 24.9 percent of households owned slaves. (Households are a broader category than families.) Each of these figures is significantly higher than the 1.4 percent cited in the social media post. State-by-state figures show some variation. In Mississippi, 49 percent of families owned slaves, and in South Carolina, 46 percent did. In border states, the percentage was lower -- 3 percent in Delaware and 12 percent in Maryland. The median for slaveholding states was about 27 percent. Using the same data, it's possible to calculate the statistic of dubious value cited in the viral image -- the percentage of all American families that owned slaves. The answer: 7.4 percent, which about five times greater than what the meme says. It's also possible that the Census data is misleadingly low, Goodheart said. ""Many non-slaveholding whites in the South rented slaves from wealthier slaveholders,"" he said. ""So it was very common for a white Southerner to be a 'slave master' but not technically a 'slave owner.""
  We were unable to find hard data to debunk -- or support -- this figure. The most solid data we found was published in an article in the Root by Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard University historian. Gates cited research by Carter G. Woodson, an African-American historian who died in 1950. He found that in 1830, a total of ""3,776 free Negroes owned 12,907 slaves."" With three more decades of population growth, it’s plausible that the number of black-owned slaves could have grown to 20,000 by 1860, historians told us. ""I'd imagine that the (20,000 figure) quoted in the meme is probably not that far off from being true,"" said Junius Rodriguez, a Eureka College historian and author of Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia. But the 20,000 number is not necessarily as eye-popping as the meme makes it out to be. For starters, even if the number is accurate, it would still account for just a tiny percentage of all slaves held in the United States in 1860 -- specifically, one half of 1 percent. That runs contrary to the post’s framing. ""That’s a very small number compared to Latin American or Caribbean societies,"" said Stephanie McCurry, a Columbia University historian and author of Confederate Reckoning: Power and Politics in the Civil War South. In addition, the figure is almost certainly inflated by a legal quirk in most antebellum southern states. It includes ""many ‘owned’ family members whom they had purchased to become free,"" said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian and the author of such books as The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery. ""You could not free a slave in most southern states without sending them out of the state."" Gates, writing in the Root, noted that the late historian Thomas J. Pressly used Woodson's statistics for 1830 to determine that about 42 percent of these black slaveholders owned just one slave. To Gates, this suggests that many -- though hardly all -- black ""slaveholders"" legally needed to ""own"" a family member such as a wife or child. As Woodson wrote in his 1924 book Free Negro Owners of Slaves in the United States in 1830, ""In many instances the husband purchased the wife or vice versa. … Slaves of Negroes were in some cases the children of a free father who had purchased his wife. If he did not thereafter emancipate the mother, as so many such husbands failed to do, his own children were born his slaves and were thus reported to the numerators."" In other cases, Woodson wrote, ""Benevolent Negroes often purchased slaves to make their lot easier by granting them their freedom for a nominal sum, or by permitting them to work it out on liberal terms."" The viral post said that ""at the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year."" In reality, far more than 1.4 percent of families in slaveholding states -- the most reasonable way to measure it -- owned slaves. The number was between 20 and 25 percent, and in some states, the rate was twice as high. As for black-owned slaves, they certainly existed, but they represented a tiny fraction of all slaves in the United States, and many were likely ""owned"" by their spouses or parents due to the prevailing laws in many slaveholding states. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096662FC0>],/factchecks/2017/aug/24/viral-image/viral-post-gets-it-wrong-extent-slavery-1860/

Steve Adler calls Austin safest big city in Texas
","Austin Mayor Steve Adler, urging transgender members of the military threatened by President Donald Trump to come to work for the Texas capital’s law enforcement agencies, ran out several tweets including a July 26, 2017, post stating: ""Austin is the safest big city in Texas partly because we know our differences make us a stronger community."" A reader asked us to check: Is Austin the state’s safest big city? Mayor cites Texas Monthly We asked Adler how he reached his conclusion. By email, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford advised that Adler relied on a Texas Monthly ""Daily Post"" story on FBI crime statistics published the day that Adler tweeted. The story includes a headline declaring Austin the state’s safest city. In the main, the story says that according to data compiled by the FBI covering 2015 and part of 2016, Odessa by far had the state’s highest violent crime rate, 1,070.1 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents, up 25 percent from 2014. The FBI classifies as violent crimes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. ""It’s long been noted that Austin is something of a fairytale land where violence is rare, and at least compared to the rest of the state, that tends to bear out,"" the story says, going on: ""Although Austin’s violent crime rate of 287.7 per 100,000 is slightly up from 2013, it’s grown at a much slower rate than any comparably safe city over the past couple of years, putting Austin in the top spot for safe Texas cities."" FBI says don’t compare jurisdictions We noticed, though, the story didn’t mention a consistent FBI advisory against employing its statistics to compare jurisdictions. Since at least 2011, the FBI has said it ""strongly discourages"" using FBI Unified Crime Reporting statistics to compare communities. That note said: ""Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale."" The FBI admonished in May 2017: ""Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place."" When we asked FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer to evaluate Adler’s claim, Fischer replied by email: ""Since crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, the FBI discourages ranking the agencies and using the data as a measurement of law enforcement effectiveness."" Fischer passed along elaboration from FBI analyst Loretta Simmons: ""Comparisons lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction."" Austin, big city? Another consideration is whether Austin fairly ranks as a big city in comparison to, say, Houston, Dallas or San Antonio. This year, before rating Half True U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s description of his hometown as the nation’s safest city, we noted that CQ Press--which annually reports on crime rates using FBI statistics--enables adjustments based on population density--and if you impose a density of at least 2,720 residents per square mile, Austin and El Paso fall out of its big-city crime rate rankings. That density squeeze, we found, left San Antonio with the No. 6 lowest crime rate nationally, Dallas at No. 12 and Houston at No. 17. Austin region’s violent crime rate Another wrinkle: The crime rates cited by Texas Monthly were not city-specific, instead taking into account metropolitan statistical areas. This means the touted Austin figures reflected crimes tallied through Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. That said, the Austin area in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than any of the state’s other regions, we confirmed in our own break-out of what’s posted by the FBI. Austin’s rate of 287.7 violent crimes per 100,000 residents greatly trailed the Odessa area’s No. 1 state rate of 1070.1 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. Meantime, the Austin region’s murder/nonnegligent manslaughter rate of 2.2 per 100,000 residents ranked third behind the rates for less-populous Wichita Falls (1.3 per 100,000 residents) and Brownsville (1.6 per 100,000 residents); the Longview area had the state’s highest rate (10.1 per 100,000 inhabitants). LOWEST VIOLENT CRIME RATES, TEXAS METRO AREAS, 2015 REGION VIOLENT CRIME RATE Austin-Round Rock 287.7 per 100,000 residents Tyler 295.7 College Station-Bryan 315.5 McAllen-Edinburg-Mission 298.1 Brownsville-Harlingen 299.8 Midland 322.3 Sherman-Denison 327.1 San Angelo 329.3 Dallas-Plano-Irving 330.6 Wichita Falls 334.5 More recent FBI data Our own look into FBI crime reports further showed that in January 2017, the agency released its preliminary report tabulating crimes in each U.S. city of 100,000 population or greater in the first half of 2016. From those figures, we roughed out the violent crime rate for each of 35 Texas cities (not metro areas) listed in the report. Our finding: Austin (population about 948,000 as of July 2016) ranked 21st in the state with a violent-crime rate of 209 incidents per 100,000 residents--trailing cities including El Paso (population about 683,000) with 195 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants); Laredo (192 violent crimes per 100,000 residents); Midland (186 violent crimes per 100,000 people); and the capital’s northern suburb, Round Rock (73 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants). See our chart here. When we alerted Stanford to what we found, he replied by email that Adler compares Austin solely to the state’s biggest cities, specifying Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth. El Paso safer? Separately, our web search turned up an April 2017 ranking of Texas cities for public safety by Pittsburgh-based Niche, a self-described ""blend of data scientists, engineers, parents, and ‘yinzers’ who are passionate about helping you discover the schools and neighborhoods that are right for you."" Starting from FBI statistics, Niche says, it based the public-safety grades on each city’s assault and robbery rates and, to lesser degrees, local rates of murder, burglary, vehicle theft and larceny plus resident responses to questions about local crime and safety. Niche ranked Austin No. 22 nationally among ""best cities to live in America"" though the city landed a public-safety grade of C+ -- like El Paso, Brownsville, Midland, Laredo, Wichita Falls and Tyler. Faring better, Plano, Richardson, College Station, and McAllen each had a public-safety grade of B-minus, per Niche, with Round Rock ranking fifth nationally thanks to its public-safety grade of B. Criminologist: Comparisons ‘chancy’ We also queried Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox about Adler’s claim. By email, Fox said he’s determined that per FBI figures, Austin in 2015 had the lowest homicide rate among 51 U.S. cities with at least 300,000 residents and at least 20 homicides; Austin’s rate was 2.5 for every 100,000 residents, narrowly besting San Diego’s 2.6 rate, according to a table Fox provided. Among Texas cities Fox evaluated, Houston had the highest homicide rate, 13.3 per 100,000 residents. Does that arguably make Austin the safest big city in Texas? Fox said by phone that such judgments are hard to cement because cities differ in many ways including, for instance, how suburban they happen to be. ""There are a whole bunch of reasons cities differ that have nothing to do with safety,"" Fox said, ""that have nothing to do with police and how they’re doing their job. That’s why it’s chancy to make those kinds of comparisons."" Our ruling Adler called Austin the safest big city in Texas. As we’ve said before — and as experts keep stressing — using crime data to declare one city ""safer"" than another is fraught with peril. That said, FBI statistics suggest the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions. But El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin in the first half of 2016. Adler’s claim adds up to a statement that’s partly accurate while lacking important context. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Donald Trump wrongly says U.S. is a net energy exporter
","In a 75-minute rally speech that revisited his response to the Charlottesville, Va., unrest and scolded the national media, President Donald Trump slid in a note of pride about the United States’ balance of trade in energy. ""We're going to do an infrastructure bill,"" Trump said. ""We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land. Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life. American hands will build this future. American energy will power this future. We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently."" Was he correct to say that the United States has ""become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently""? Short answer: No. But to get to the short answer, you have to wade through several possible interpretations of what Trump meant. (The White House did not clarify his meaning for us.) One way to read Trump’s statement is to take it literally -- that the United States only recently began to export energy. This is flat wrong. ""We have been exporting coal, natural gas, electricity, refined products and energy technologies for a very long time,"" said Paul Sullivan, a professor at National Defense University and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University who specializes in energy security issues. ""We were once, during the time of JD Rockefeller, the world's near monopoly on kerosene. Liquefied natural gas exports from Alaska to Japan have been around for a long time. Piped gas to Mexico and Canada are normal events. We have a massive electricity trade with Canada."" Trump might have meant that the United States had only recently become a net exporter of energy -- meaning the total of all U.S. energy exports recently overtook the total of all U.S. energy imports. This is less wrong, but still not accurate. ""This has been falling, but we are still a huge net energy importer,"" said Jason Bordoff, who directs Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In its most recent projections, the federal Energy Information Administration concluded that the United States would become a net energy exporter around 2026, depending on the course of future patterns of global supply, demand and pricing.  What’s clear is that the United States has not yet become a net exporter of energy, as Trump’s past-tense remark indicated. If that day comes in 2026 -- and it may or may not -- that would be two years after Trump finishes a possible second term. Perhaps rather than ""energy,"" Trump meant to say ""crude oil."" If this is what Trump meant, the statement would still be problematic. It wouldn’t be the first time ""ever."" And the relevant change was signed under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. On Dec. 18, 2015, the United States enacted legislation to repeal a ban on most crude-oil exports that had been in place since the energy-crisis days of 1975. (Exports of refined petroleum were not blocked by the law, just crude.) Here’s a chart showing U.S. crude-oil exports going back to the 1980s. (The years between 1975 and 2015 show some export activity because trade with some countries, such as Canada, was exempt from the law.) The rapid rise in crude-oil exports near the end of the chart reflects the lifting of the export-restriction law.  It’s possible to substitute any number of energy subcategories into Trump’s remark to see whether they make the statement more accurate. Some do, some don’t. The United States has been a net coal exporter for many years. It has been a net exporter of refined petroleum products since around 2011. So neither of those would make Trump correct. Natural gas is a more promising option. The United States is not yet a net exporter of natural gas, but the difference between imports and exports has narrowed for nine consecutive years, according to EIA, falling to its smallest gap ever in 2016. And the agency projects that the United States will become a net exporter of natural gas once the 2017 numbers are tallied up.  Energy experts say that this is a significant development, though one that Trump can take little credit for. ""It has been a trend that was activated by the U.S. shale boom and made possible by the Obama administration's policy on liquefied natural gas exports,"" said Anna Mikulska, a fellow with Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. Ironically, Bordoff added, a different Trump policy goal -- reviewing Obama-era increases in fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles -- could make it harder for the United States to become a net exporter of energy, the very thing he applauded in Phoenix. ""Trump’s stated intention to ease fuel economy standards actually undermines the goal of becoming a net energy exporter, because it means the U.S. will be consuming more oil than we would otherwise,"" he said. ""The EIA projections assume the planned increases in fuel economy go into effect, so the EIA projection of when we become a net exporter of energy would be pushed further out if we weaken fuel economy standards."" Trump said that ""we have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently."" This statement is problematic regardless of how you interpret his statement -- gross energy exports, net energy exports, gross crude-oil exports, and net natural gas exports. The closest he would come to being accurate is if he were referring to net natural gas exports, but even there, it hasn’t happened yet, contrary to what his past-tense statement indicates. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C31280>],/factchecks/2017/aug/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-us-net-energy-exporte/

Are Trump's travels imposing historic costs on taxpayers, as David Frum said?
","Following news that President Donald Trump’s packed travel schedule and large family have depleted the Secret Service’s annual funds, conservative pundit David Frum declared the costs incurred by the president unprecedented. ""No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump,"" he wrote on Twitter. No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump. https://t.co/Zvp2cyJoNS In an interview, Frum clarified that ""personal lifestyle costs"" excluded work trips, such as the G20 conference in Hamburg, Germany, or presidential residences where security costs are fixed, like the presidential retreat at Camp David. The pricey personal trips Frum had in mind include weekend trips to Trump-owned golf resorts in Palm Beach, Fla., Sterling, Va., and Bedminster, N.J. ""The Florida/Bedminster costs are entirely volitional, as are the costs of Melania’s decision to live apart from her husband for most of his first year in office. There is no public purpose to any of those decisions,"" Frum told PolitiFact. As we’ve said before, it’s hard to separate leisure and work when it comes to the presidency, particularly as Trump has hosted state visits at his resorts. That said, might Trump’s leisure trips and residential circumstances amount to the costliest in presidential history? It’s too early to tell, as even the highest estimates of Trump’s spending can’t match former President Barack Obama’s eight years in office. Although Frum didn’t include this qualifier, he might have meant at this point in Trump’s presidency. Trump does seem on pace to outstrip previous presidential spending by the end of his term. Trump has left the White House more often at this point in his presidency than other modern presidents, according to CBS White House correspondent Mark Knoller, and the cost of protecting Trump while he’s away is not cheap. Here’s the important point to keep in mind: There are no definitive reports on the cost of Trump’s travel, nor of any other president. The most comprehensive analyses exist on Trump and Obama’s presidencies, and have been carried out by watchdog groups. The Government Accountability Office is the agency that traditionally computes costs for presidential travel, but its analysts have not calculated lifestyle costs for any president. Instead, they’ve looked into specific trips at Congress’ request. The latest report looked at the cost of a four-day vacation President Barack Obama took to Palm Beach in February 2013. The trip cost approximately $3.6 million, and has formed the basis of much speculation on the cost of Trump’s travel. Basing its estimates on that report, the liberal Center for American Progress’ said that a trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, which we rated Half True. It’s not precise to stick that price tag on every presidential trip, as costs vary depending on the size of the vehicles used and where they’re flown in from. That trip included a stop in Obama’s hometown of Chicago, and costs for Air Force One travel were also almost $60,000 higher per hour at the time, according to Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations for public records. Using the $3.6 million estimate, the Center for American Progress placed Trump’s personal travel costs through Aug. 3 at $32 million. That’s a bit under a third of what Judicial Watch calculated Obama spent on personal travel in his eight years in office ($100 million). Judicial Watch offered a more conservative estimate for Trump. The watchdog group calculated the costs of five of Trump’s and three of Melania’s Mar-a-Lago visits and Vice President Mike Pence’s Super Bowl trip in February using Air Force hourly travel rates obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Those added up to a total of $3.6 million. That excludes, however, any of Trump’s trips after March and security costs, as the Secret Service hasn’t yet provided the data requested through the Freedom of Information Act. They also exclude other expenses, like $3.3 million in overtime costs Palm Beach County’s presidential residence protection program incurred during Trump’s visits. An internal agency document obtained by the Washington Post in March gives a better estimate of the amount spent on security by the Trump administration. The report said the Secret Service requested $60 million in additional funding for next year. $26.8 million would go to protecting Trump’s family in Trump Tower and $33 million would fund travel costs. The Management and Budget Office had rejected the request. More recently, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles told USA Today that more than 1,000 agents have already hit the federally mandated annual caps for salary and overtime allowances. He attributed the dearth to both an unprecedented number of White House protectees -- Trump has 42, including his 18 family members, whereas Obama had 31 -- and efforts to secure Trump’s multiple residences. Alles is in conversation with lawmakers to raise the cap from $160,000 per year to $187,000, but even that would leave 130 veteran agents without full compensation for hundreds of hours of work. Congress also had to approve compensation for 1,400 agents’ thousands of hours of overtime that were earned above the limit in 2016. In the absence of concrete cost figures, we compared the president and the vice president’s collective travel, measured loosely by the number of days logged by Secret Service agents protecting the vice president and president when they traveled. More agents worked travel days protecting Obama and Vice President Joe Biden at the six-month mark than Trump: 534 travel days to 378 for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. But when we added the president and vice president’s associated family members into the mix, agents had traveled 4,054 days protecting Trump to Obama’s 1,621. That’s in part because Trump has a larger family with adult children whose business ties take them all over the world. The 567 personnel assigned to the Office of Protective Operation are projected to exceed the pay cap in 2017, which put them on track to equal the total overtime hours worked in 2016.

Trump's False claim that there weren't too many people protesting his Phoenix rally
","President Donald Trump opened his campaign rally in Phoenix noting a matter of importance to him: crowd sizes. ""What a crowd,"" Trump said Aug. 22 about his supporters inside the Phoenix Convention Center, the site of one of his first major campaign rallies two years earlier. He immediately drew attention to another group of people: ""And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK. That I can tell you."" Trump downplayed the number of protesters at other points in his 75-minute speech. But the president’s narrative was at odds with what TV news viewers had seen for hours leading up to Trump taking the stage. The coverage on national networks showed sizeable crowds out on the streets carrying signs criticizing the president and his response to the Charlottesville, Va., riots ignited by supporters of white supremacist and anti-Semitic groups. The Phoenix Police Chief also said there were ""tens of thousands"" of people out on the streets. Here are the facts. As Trump delivered his speech, he sought to spotlight the people inside the convention center, asking cameras to put them on TV ""because it is rather incredible."" (CNN obliged.) Trump was also interrupted by a protester inside the convention center as he defended his series of responses to the violence in Charlottesville. ""Don't bother, it's only a single voice. And not a very powerful voice,"" Trump said. ""How did he get in here? He's supposed to be with the few people outside.""     (People protest outside the Phoenix Convention Center on Aug. 22, 2017, in Phoenix. Protests were held against President Donald Trump as he hosted a rally inside the convention center. / AP) Trump suggested Phoenix’ hot weather kept protesters away. ""How about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside. Where are they? Well, it's hot out. It is hot. I think it's too warm,"" Trump said. ""You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything."" ""Antifa!"" he shouted, the shorthand term for anti-fascists, which broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists. The next day, Trump continued boasting about the amount of people who showed up to support him. ""Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border!"" another tweet said. Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border! We did not get a response from the White House when we requested more information on Trump’s claim of few protesters. We asked the U.S. Secret Service — which Trump cited as his source of information — about their estimates of crowd sizes outside the convention center, but did not get a figure. ""For operational security purposes we do not publicly discuss the methods and means on how we conduct our protective operations,"" said Mason F. Brayman, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the Secret Service. Leading up to the rally, Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams said the department would have ""maximum staffing"" and emphasized its experience handling other major events, such as Super Bowls. In a press briefing after the events, Williams said there had been ""tens of thousands"" of people downtown. (Trump said he brought 15,000 people into the convention center. The Phoenix Fire Marshal approved capacity up to 19,000 people.) ""We had tens of thousands of people downtown peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights,"" Williams said. ""What’s unfortunate is that a very small number of individuals chose criminal conduct.""   (Protesters outside the Phoenix Convention Center hold up anti-President Donald Trump signs and shout back at Trump supporters waiting to enter a rally by Trump on Aug. 22, 2017, in Phoenix, Ariz. / Getty) Azcentral.com reported that demonstrators outside the convention center ""largely refrained from violence"" throughout the day.

Several videos and photo galleries from local media depict the crowds of protesters, which included people advocating for immigrant rights and against hate groups.

Barcelona terrorist related to Barack Obama, fake news site falsely says
","A fake news story falsely claimed that one of the suspected terrorists arrested after an attack in Barcelona is actually former President Barack Obama’s cousin. ""Barcelona terrorist has a cousin in the U.S. named Barack,"" read the headline on an Aug. 19, 2017, post on NewsConservative.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The story said Driss Oukabir, a 28-year-old Moroccan-born man arrested after terrorists killed 13 and injured more than 100 in Barcelona on Aug. 17, had toured the White House in 2009. The trip was sponsored by his first cousin, whom the story named as Obama. ""Oukibir (sic) is the 7th child of the 5th wife of the brother of Barack Obama Sr., Obama’s father from Kenya,"" the story read. ""Being first cousins, he was able to gain an audience and actually sit in the Oval Office. Eight years later he drove a vehicle into a crowd, killing at least a dozen people."" In reality, Driss Oukabir is the brother of 18-year-old Moussa Oukabir, who is suspected of being the driver of a van that purposely ran into people in Barcelona. As many as three vans, including the one used in the terror attack, were allegedly rented with Driss Oukabir’s ID. Driss Oukabir turned himself into authorities after media outlets began circulating his photo in connection with the attack. He told police in the Spanish city of Ripoll, where he lived, that his identification had been stolen and that he did not participate in any terrorist activities. That's where the truth ends. The story of any relation to Obama, however, is pure bunk, and comes from an infamous fake news site.

The story was posted a week after Aug. 12 clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters over efforts to take down Confederate monuments. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake story is obviously designed to shock readers that the child of a civil rights hero like Parks could embrace controversial comments by Trump, who had called the violence in Charlottesville a result of ""hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides."" The post quoted someone named Muriel Parks-Rosenberg speaking at an event at the Kennedy Center. ""President Trump’s reaction has been criticized by the Left, but I don’t see what he did wrong,"" she is quoted as saying.

""My mother would have been proud of the President’s words,"" she allegedly told the crowd. ""Liberals who seek to use this rally to further their cause and attack President Trump need to go away and never come back. To me, Donald Trump is a modern civil rights icon."" Parks is credited as helping spark the civil rights movement after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955. Parks died in 2005 at age 92.

"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'New York', 'Sean Patrick Maloney']","
Two-thirds of those on Medicaid are children, seniors or disabled
","One-third of New York state residents are on Medicaid, the federal-state program that helps pay for health care. We recently rated that claim True in a fact-check on U.S. Rep. John Faso of the Hudson Valley. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat whose district neighbors Faso’s, responded to that statement with a claim about the Republican replacement for Obamacare. ""I heard [Faso] say recently that too many people are on Medicaid,"" Maloney said. ""I'm just wondering which people he thinks we should throw off their insurance, because most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled."" The replacement would have reduced federal Medicaid spending increases, a measure Democrats oppose. The bill is now in limbo after failing in the Senate last month. Democrats in New York state want to preserve the Medicaid program, often citing the number of people who rely on it. But is Maloney right that most people in the program are children, seniors, or have a disability? National numbers The average monthly Medicaid enrollment in 2016 was nearly 71 million, according to the most recent estimates from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency’s report breaks down the numbers: • 28 million recipients were children. • 5.7 million recipients were age 65 or older. • 10.6 million recipients had a disability or were blind. • The remaining 28.1 million were adults below 65 without a disability or residents in U.S territories. A total of 44.3 million Medicaid recipients were children, seniors, or had a disability in 2016 according to the estimates. That’s almost two-thirds of the Medicaid population. Enrollment data from 2014, the latest official count, shows those groups made up about 65 percent of the Medicaid population that year. That distribution is not out of the ordinary, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. ""It’s because of how the program is structured and it’s because of who the people are,"" Rosenbaum said. ""For the elderly and the disabled, Medicaid is the means by which we do long term support for services in the United States."" Medicaid is used by seniors who need long term care but cannot afford a private insurance plan to supplement Medicare, which does not cover long-term care. People with a disability also rely on the program to cover continuous care. The share of children on Medicaid, meanwhile, is a reflection of how many children live in poverty, Rosenbaum said. ""Families know that if your children need insurance, you turn to the Medicaid program,"" Rosenbaum said. New York numbers Maloney spoke in the context of national numbers, but the same claim would be true for New York state. The average monthly Medicaid enrollment was 6.1 million in New York as of April, according to the state Department of Health. • More than two million beneficiaries in New York are children. • Another 700,527 either have a disability or are blind. • Another 639,488 are people age 65 or older. • The remaining 2.8 million are adults below 65 without a disability. The three categories Maloney mentioned make up more than 3.3 million of New York’s Medicaid enrollees, or about 55 percent. Our ruling Maloney said ""most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled."" The word ""most"" may mean different things to different people. Not even dictionaries are clear, where meanings vary from ""the majority of"" to ""nearly all of."" Nationally, two-thirds of people on Medicaid are either children, seniors or disabled, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. For us, we rate two-thirds as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972FF1C0>],/factchecks/2017/aug/23/sean-patrick-maloney/most-people-medicaid-are-children-seniors-or-have-/

Testing Scott Walker's Top 10 business ranking claim
","Gov. Scott Walker has sought to make business development and job creation a foundational part of his legacy in the state — a drive boosted by the announcement that Foxconn Technology Group plans to build a $10 billion plant here. So it’s no surprise the state’s business climate has been a common refrain in the push to win the plant and in the victory laps since Foxconn’s decision. That included this July 19, 2017, tweet from Walker: ""We took Wisconsin from the Bottom 10 for business to the Top 10. Our reforms are working and more are on the way!"" The same claim showed up in a column published Aug. 4, 2017, in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. What does it mean to be in the ""Top 10"" for business, and who decides that? Let’s dig in. Many surveys, many results Walker’s tweet didn’t cite a source, but Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said it referred to a ranking from Chief Executive Magazine, which placed Wisconsin No. 10 in its 2017 Best & Worst States for Business. The same survey ranked Wisconsin 41st in 2010, the year Walker was elected. That’s the bottom 10 of his claim. The ranking — which Walker’s touted in a news release when it was released in May — is based on a survey asking CEOs their perceptions of each state. Many national groups do similar surveys with a variety of methodologies, but most others aren’t so keen on Wisconsin’s business climate. Here’s a sampling of the most recent ratings from prominent sources: CNBC’s 2017 scorecard ranked Wisconsin 21st in economic climate, based on an analysis of more than 60 measures, such as workforce, infrastructure, cost of doing business, economy and quality of life. The Tax Foundation’s 2017 ranking of state tax climate pegs Wisconsin at 39th for how well a state’s tax system is structured for business. Site Selection Magazine ranked Wisconsin 25th for overall business climate in 2016, which it calculates by combining a survey of corporate site selectors and data on recent projects sited in the state. Forbes ranked Wisconsin 27th in 2016 among its best states for business based on a combined ranking that included business cost, labor supply, regulatory environment, economic climate, growth prospects and quality of life. The Kauffman Index publishes three rankings on aspects of entrepreneurial activity. Among the largest 25 states in 2016, it ranked Wisconsin second for Main Street entrepreneurship (per capita small businesses and business owners), 23rd for growth entrepreneurship (how much new businesses have grown) and 25th for startup activity (number of new businesses and business owners). An undated ranking from US NEWS & World Report puts the state’s business environment at 32nd, based on private business birth rate and number of patents per capita. Among the prominent national rankings, the Chief Executive Magazine one cited by Walker is the only one that does not have some objective, data-based component. Mike Winkleman, the magazine’s editor in chief, said the survey was sent to CEOs of the 42,000 largest companies in the country, of which about 500 responded. Each was asked to rank the four best and four worst states for doing business, and those were compiled into the national rankings using a points system. Rankings overly simplistic, experts say Site selectors, who analyze state and local business climates for a living, say such rankings are trying to paint broadly and objectively what is inherently specific and subjective. ""There is no ‘best’ state (or states) for every type of business,"" Andrew Shapiro, managing director of site selection company Biggins Lacy Shapiro & Company, said in an email. ""These rankings can be methodologically suspect and as a result can vary wildly from survey to survey and from year to year."" A concept like ""business climate"" means different things to different people and can’t really be objectively defined or ranked in a general way, said Darin Buelow, a principal and head of the site selection group for Deloitte Consulting. ""Any site selection or location decision has to be customized to a particular company and their particular needs,"" Buelow said. ""A state or a community or a county might be a great place to do business for one company in a certain industry sector, but it could be a terrible place to do business for another company."" Larry Gigerich, executive managing director of Ginovus, an Indiana-based site selection firm, said the surveys can catch the eye of business leaders in some cases and may get a state some initial consideration, but conditions specific to that project and industry determine final decisions. He said the rankings his firm typically pays attention to are CNBC, Chief Executive Magazine, Site Selection Magazine and the Kauffman Index’s growth entrepreneurship score. Wisconsin ranked an average of 20th among those four. Moving in the right direction Chief Executive Magazine is an outlier in how highly it ranks Wisconsin’s current business climate, but Wisconsin’s rankings have improved across the board since 2010. The CNBC ranking rose from 29 to 21, Forbes from 40 to 27 and the Tax Foundation a lesser uptick from 42 to 39. Site Selection Magazine only ranks the top 25, and Wisconsin was not ranked in 2010. ""I think for the most part the state has shown significant improvement in terms of both perception and its business climate"" since Walker took over, said Gigerich, who has helped locate sites for 300 projects, including about 25 that considered Wisconsin. ""Wisconsin is not one of the lowest-cost states to do business in, but it is one that is now competitive, where I think a decade ago Wisconsin struggled with its tax structure and … economic incentive programs."" Several site selectors pointed to the creation of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation as a step in the right direction, though they noted the state is still being held back by its aging transportation infrastructure. ""They’ve certainly done a better job of marketing and articulating Wisconsin’s value proposition as a destination for advanced manufacturing,"" Buelow said. Evenson, the Walker spokesman, said Foxconn’s decision to build in Wisconsin is evidence of change.The Asian electronics giant has said it will employ thousands at a massive flat screen television plant in southeastern Wisconsin. Our rating Walker said Wisconsin is now a Top 10 state for business when it used to be in the bottom 10. Site selection professionals say they have seen improvements in Wisconsin’s business environment, but note there is no consensus on how to define and rank the business climate between states. Walker’s claim was made broadly and without attribution even though it referred to just one of many rankings that attempt to quantify data and perceptions on states’ business environments. It is the only prominent national ranking to rank Wisconsin in the Top 10 aside from an index that focuses narrowly on small businesses. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CAA80>],/factchecks/2017/aug/23/scott-walker/testing-scott-walkers-top-10-business-ranking-clai/

Has crime been getting worse in California since Jerry Brown was elected governor?
","Republicans including California State Sen. John Moorlach have railed against Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown for signing a gas tax increase earlier this year. The Orange County lawmaker took his criticism a step further in a recent op-ed in which he predicted the gas tax hike, combined with California’s cap-and-trade extension, would boost gas prices so much that thieves would start siphoning fuel from cars. Moorlach went on to declare that crime has been on the rise under Brown. ""Crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor,"" Moorlach wrote in the Aug. 4 piece in the Sacramento Bee. ""The Bee reported, three-quarters of California’s largest cities saw violent crime rise in 2015, with Sacramento’s up 25 percent."" We’ve fact-checked similar claims about increasing crime rates from other California lawmakers including State Sen. Jeff Stone of Riverside County and Assemblyman Travis Allen, an Orange County Republican running for governor. There’s been some truth in those claims, but those who made them also ignored key context or distorted the facts. We wondered how Moorlach’s statement, specifically the portion about crime getting worse since Brown was elected, stacked up. California crime trends Before diving into the senator’s claim, here’s some background on California crime trends. Like the rest of the United States, California has experienced a dramatic long-term reduction in crime over the past several decades. Between 1980 and 2015, the state’s overall crime rate declined by about 60 percent, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. SOURCE: California Legislative Analyst's Office.  The property crime rate peaked in California at nearly 7,000 crimes per 100,000 population in the early 1980s. Three decades later, it had dropped by more than half. The violent crime rate saw a similar dramatic drop during this period. Moorlach’s claim In his op-ed, Moorlach focuses on crime ""since Jerry Brown was elected governor."" We took that to mean Brown’s current stretch as governor, which started with his election to a third term in 2010 and continued with re-election to a fourth term in 2014. Brown served his first two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983. For this current stretch, we looked at crime data from 2010 through 2016, the most current year available. We also considered the period 2010 through 2015 because Moorlach’s spokesman said the senator did not have had access to a California Department of Justice report on crime for 2016, given that it was released two weeks after his op-ed published. No matter the exact years selected, California’s crime story during over the past half decade is not as simple as Moorlach’s statement implies. The statewide crime rate, which measures both violent and property crimes, ticked up in 2012 and 2015. It decreased, however, in the other four years during Brown’s current stint. This overall crime rate includes violent and property crimes. Violent crimes are homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Examples of property crimes include burglary, theft and vandalism. Jonathan Peterson, a fiscal and policy analyst at the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, cautioned that year-over-year changes can make it look like crime is growing rapidly, ""but it could be a blip."" Peterson said the past six to seven years have been marked by fluctuations in California’s crime rate, not a steady increase or decrease. Stanford Law School Professor John Donohue, who researches crime trends, said Moorlach's claim might contain an element of truth but overall is flawed.  ""One has to be very cautious about politicians making statements about crime because they will often try to make the numbers say something that isn’t quite representative,"" said Donohue. ""The broad trend for the last 25 years has been down and very benign. Crime is at a much lower level in practically every place today than it was 25 years ago. But in the last couple years there has been an uptick (in California and nationwide), and that’s a reason for concern."" Deeper look at crime data To fact-check Moorlach’s claim about crime getting worse, we examined statistics from the California Department of Justice’s recent report Crime in California 2016. It includes crime rate data from 1966 through 2016. The data show that from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year from which Moorlach likely drew his conclusions, California’s overall crime rate declined slightly from 3,069 crimes per 100,000 population to 3,047 crimes per 100,000. This casts doubt on Moorlach’s claim that crime has been getting worse. Even when examining the violent crime rate alone, the results are mixed. In three of the years since Brown was elected, the violent crime rate notched up, while it dipped in the the other three years. Had Moorlach narrowed his claim to 2011, Brown’s first year back as governor, through 2015, the crime story would be slightly different. California’s overall crime rate inched up between those years, from 3,007 crimes per 100,000 population to 3,047 per 100,000. Moorlach’s response Sen. Moorlach’s spokesman provided us with links to about a half-dozen news articles that detailed crime increases across California. None of the articles, however, showed a sustained increase from 2010 through 2016. In his op-ed, Moorlach cited a spike in violent crime in 2015. He’s right for that single year for that type of crime: state justice department figures show an 8.4 percent rise in violent crime in 2015 compared with the prior year. In recent months, politicians such as Assemblyman Allen have pointed to this period as evidence for growing crime concern in California. Many have cited a PPIC analysis comparing the first half of 2014 to the same period in 2015. It found widespread increases in crime rates in California cities with a population greater than 100,000. Of the 66 California cities that size, 49 saw an increase in violent crime and 48 experienced increases in property crime. Many saw double digit percent increases. A subsequent report comparing the first half of 2016 with the first half of 2015 showed overall crime decreasing, driven by a drop in property crimes. That report was published by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a policy research group that makes recommendations on alternatives to incarceration. Two weeks after Moorlach’s op-ed was published, the California Department of Justice released statewide crime statistics for 2016. That report showed a slight decrease in the total crime rate, driven by a nearly 3 percent decline in the property crime rate. Violent crime, meanwhile, increased about 4 percent in 2016. We won’t use these statistics as a determining factor in our rating for Moorlach’s claim since his spokesman said the senator didn’t have the report. The 2016 data, however, appear to support the idea that crime has not followed a consistent pattern in California over the past half dozen years. Our rating Republican State Sen. John Moorlach recently claimed ""crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor."" His spokesman pointed to news articles that cite an uptick in crime in 2015, when many large cities in California saw double-digit increases in violent crime. But neither those articles nor state crime reports show a sustained increase from the time of Brown was elected governor in 2010 through the current period. In fact, there was a slight decrease in the state’s overall crime rate from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year Moorlach was likely referring to. Crime researchers emphasized that California and the nation have experienced a dramatic decrease in crime in recent decades. They say California’s crime rate increases in 2012 and in 2015, however, are reason for concern but are not evidence that crime has gotten worse over the past half dozen years. We rate Moorlach’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. After the Fact:  Moorlach responds to crime fact check  After our fact-check published, Sen. Moorlach responded by saying crime has increased in California under Gov. Jerry Brown if one looks at a more narrow period, from 2011 through 2015. We used 2010 as a baseline for our research given that Moorlach’s original statement said ""crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor."" Voters elected Brown governor in November 2010 and he took office in January 2011. Using 2010 as a baseline both adhered to Moorlach’s original timeframe and gave us a chance to examine how the crime rate had changed under Brown compared with the year immediately preceding his governorship. Moorlach correctly points out on Twitter that: ""Your own report admits crime increased from 2011-2015, a very large period of Gov. Brown's time in office."" He also emphasized this point in a blog post on Medium.com. As we pointed out in the fact check, the crime rate has fluctuated during Brown’s tenure. It increased in 2012 and again in 2015, provoking concern from politicians and those who research crime trends. The other four years under Brown, however, the crime rate has decreased. In the end, when one measures the overall crime rate from 2010 through 2015 and through 2016, both fuller pictures of Brown’s time in office, there’s a slight decrease. Our rating remains the same.

In the post, Lewis didn’t list the lawsuits Cooper has filed or describe the context surrounding them. Cooper was sworn in Jan. 1, so he’s been governor for nearly eight months. According to his office, he’s filed three lawsuits against legislative leaders since voters elected him – one of those coming before his inauguration. PolitiFact North Carolina searched for additional lawsuits and found none. Lewis said Cooper is trying to extend his power. Cooper’s lawsuits are indeed related to the scope of the governor’s powers. But Lewis fails to mention on his blog that, after Cooper was elected but before he was sworn in, Republican legislators – including Lewis – and former Gov. Pat McCrory enacted new laws that alter or limit the responsibilities and powers of the governor. Lawsuit 1 Cooper filed the first lawsuit on Dec. 30, when he was still governor-elect, to block measures the legislature adopted that merge the state elections and ethics boards and remove Cooper's ability to create a Democratic majority on the State Board of Elections. Cooper amended the lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court on Jan. 10, challenging the legislature's action to make the governor's Cabinet appointments subject to state Senate confirmation. Judges issued a split decision in the case, ruling for Cooper on elections but against him on Cabinet confirmation. Lawsuit 2 Cooper’s second lawsuit, which he filed in April, is a follow-up to his first lawsuit. After the court ruled that the governor’s appointees should control the state elections and ethics board, the legislature passed a new law that allows him to select its members from lists compiled by the two major political parties. Cooper contended that the goal was the same, to hamstring the governor, and filed a new lawsuit. A court sided with the legislature. A panel of judges sided with the legislature. But the governor has asked the state supreme court to review that decision, on appeal. Lawsuit 3 Cooper filed the third lawsuit on May 26, accusing the legislative leaders of trying to strip him of power to appoint state Court of Appeals judges and N.C. Industrial Commission members. Cooper amended the lawsuit on Aug. 8, challenging the legislature’s budget over funding related to school vouchers, a legal settlement with Volkswagen, and more - an amendment that came after Lewis’s statement. Counting lawsuits Cooper’s office says it has filed three lawsuits and two amendments. Lewis’ office, after being questioned about the blog post, said it was counting the number of individual complaints in the lawsuits. Mark Coggins, Lewis’ policy analyst, broke down the lawsuit topics in an email. He said Cooper’s lawsuits touch on: Whether the state Constitution allows the General Assembly to combine the state elections and state ethics boards Who has the authority to dismiss certain state employees Who has the authority to appoint members to the state’s Industrial Commission Who has the authority to distribute certain federal funds Whether the state Senate has the authority to block Cooper’s Cabinet nominees Who has the authority to appoint members to ""various boards and commissions."" Whether Cooper has ""additional authority over the statutory baseline over the position of executive director"" of the ethics board. A ‘simplistic’ quote? Cooper is not the first North Carolina governor to sue the legislature. McCrory sued legislative leaders saying they overstepped their authority in trying to establish a new commission to regulate coal ash, and the N.C. Supreme Court ruled in his favor last year. Bob Orr, a former justice on the state Supreme Court, characterized Cooper’s lawsuits as part of power jockeying that’s happened for years.  ""The litigation we’re seeing by Gov. Cooper is an expansion of that inherent tension and conflict between the executive branch and legislative branch,"" Orr said. Orr, a Republican, critiqued Lewis’ quote as ""simplistic."" Cooper’s lawsuits are not frivolous power grabs, he said. ""I can’t fault Gov. Cooper for challenging the acts that he feels violates the separation of powers. That’s a core constitutional principle,"" Orr said. Why make the claim? Rep. Lewis co-chairs the legislative committee leading the effort to redraw districts in the state House and state Senate that federal courts determined were unconstitutional gerrymanders. He’s one of the most influential state lawmakers. Lewis wrote the blog post on July 31 in reaction to a report by the N.C. Insider that elections board vacancies were preventing resolution of an elections complaint involving municipal elections in Morehead City. Lewis pointed out that elections boards are vacant because Cooper is challenging the elections law. Because the issue is tied up in the courts, some county boards can’t fill their vacancies, keeping them from reaching a quorum needed to hold meetings. The state elections board is aware of 16 county elections boards that don’t have a quorum. ""Governor Cooper’s lawsuit regarding the Bipartisan Ethics and Elections Board has essentially frozen elections administration in place in many counties,"" Coggins, Lewis’ policy analyst, explained in an email. ""Citizens should care that this lawsuit could undermine the conduct of this fall’s local elections,"" Coggins wrote. Lewis believes voters should blame Cooper for ""filing lawsuits that undermine local elections."" Our ruling Lewis said Cooper has filed ""nearly one lawsuit a month, with every single one of them an attempt to extend his own power."" In fact, Cooper had filed three lawsuits and an amendment over seven months when Lewis made his claim. Lewis gives the impression that Cooper has been wildly filing lawsuits to expand his powers. But the lawsuits primarily respond to reductions in power passed by Lewis’s party shortly before Cooper took office and afterward. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971BC380>],/factchecks/2017/aug/22/david-lewis/nc-rep-lewis-says-gov-cooper-has-filed-nearly-one-/
"['National', 'Guns', 'Matthew Rosendale']","
Republican Senate hopeful's absurd claim Montana Sen. Jon Tester supports a national gun registry
","While declaring his U.S. Senate bid, Republican hopeful Matt Rosendale zeroed in on the Second Amendment record of his opponent Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. ""Tester believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government,"" Rosendale, Montana's state auditor, said in a July 31 interview on Voices of Montana. We decided to investigate whether Tester supports a national gun registry. It turns out the opposite is true. This point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry. ""When people talk about national gun registration, they most commonly are talking about a list of people who own guns lawfully, or a list of the guns that are lawfully owned,"" said David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who has authored several books on gun control. An important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era’s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers. While some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that’s inconsistent with common parlance. Further, Rosendale’s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to ""the people of Montana,"" and Rosendale’s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry. We asked Rosendale’s campaign for evidence that Tester supports a national gun registry. They pointed us to a vote Tester cast in favor of a 2015 amendment sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that failed in the Senate. Did that measure seek to establish a federal list of guns and their owners? Not even close. For the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories. The Feinstein amendment sought to extend the FBI’s list to those on the U.S. government’s consolidated terror watchlist of known or suspected terrorists, and grant the attorney general discretion to deny them from buying a gun. The Rosendale campaign’s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry. Experts dismissed the notion that to deny gun sales to the government’s list of known and suspected terrorists, flawed as it may be, is the same thing as making a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and its owners. ""The terror watch list is not a gun registry,"" said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. ""In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!"" David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign’s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn’t add up. ""This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry,"" Hemenway said. ""He doesn't seem to understand what a registry is."" So Rosendale’s central claim is flat wrong — but he didn’t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to ""ask permission from the federal government"" before they purchase a gun. Because the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim’s absurdity. The Rosendale campaign said further that Tester’s votes against several measures means he is tolerant of a national gun registry because these measures would have made it harder to enact one. However — leaving aside whether these bills would have done that — the reality is that Tester’s record shows clear instances where he opposed gun registries. Tester voted for the 2013 Manchin-Toomey Amendment, a bipartisan background check plan, which we previously found would have strengthened federal law prohibiting the creation of a national gun registry. In 2011, he was among a group of lawmakers who pushed for a provision to block federal funding from being used to retain gun background check records for more than 24 hours, and voted in favor of the bill that contained this provision. (Tester expressed concern as early as 2006 that maintaining such records could be the first step toward a national gun registry). He also co-signed a 2011 letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raising Second Amendment concerns that a proposed U.N. arms trade deal could lead to an ""international gun registry."" For this, Tester earned praise from the National Rifle Association for ""stand(ing) on the side of America's 80 million gun owners in opposition to those who want to eliminate our freedoms."" Rosendale said Tester ""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government."" Tester’s record shows opposition to a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and gun owners. To claim he supports this is absurd. We rate this Pants on Fire.

"['Deficit', 'Education', 'Federal Budget', 'Virginia', 'Jamie Radtke']","
Jamie Radtke says George Allen voted to raise debt ceiling four times while in office
","
With federal budget deficits in the news, Tea Party activist and Republican Senate candidate Jamie Radtke has been painting primary opponent George Allen as a spendthrift.

Allen spent one term in the Senate before being defeated by Democratic Sen. Jim Webb in 2006, who will not seek reelection next year. After Congress reached a late-night budget agreement April 8, avoiding a government shutdown, Radtke and Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate, called on Allen to state how he would have voted on the deal. Kaine said he favored the agreement; Radtke said she would have voted against it.

On April 12, Allen said he would have ""reluctantly voted for this small effort to reduce spending increases in order avoid a government shutdown.""

Hours after he made the statement, Radtke pounced.

""He reluctantly voted yes to add $3 trillion to the debt, he reluctantly voted yes on the federal takeover of education called No Child Left Behind, he reluctantly voted yes to increase the debt ceiling four times, he reluctantly went along with the rest of the D.C. establishment as the federal debt went up $16,000 every second he was in office.""

We aren’t mind readers, so we can’t look back and determine Allen’s reluctance at any given moment. But we can tell you whether Allen really did make those votes, as Radtke claims.

Let’s start with the claims on debt. The statements -- that the nation added $3 trillion in debt, or $16,000 for every second of Allen’s six-year term -- are identical to charges Radtke made in January.

Though Radtke’s math was off a touch when she made the original claims, we found she actually underestimated the debt added by the budgets approved by Allen and other members of Congress during his tenure.  

Under the budgets approved during Allen’s term, debt climbed by $3.202 trillion. Congress sets budgets through a series of appropriations bills, and Allen supported all of the roughly four dozen bills to hit the Senate floor during his term.
   
Allen served 2,193 days in the Senate, or 189,475,200 seconds.
   
He voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 per second. That’s almost $497 a second more than Radtke credited to Allen. But consider this: The debt has risen by $51,856.89  a second since he left office.

So Radtke’s right about the total debt. What about the debt ceiling, the limit on U.S. federal borrowing that is set by Congress?

Chuck Hansen, Radtke’s director of communications, pointed us to four votes, which occurred in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2006.  

On each occasion, according to Senate records of the votes, Allen voted to raise the debt ceiling. Virginia’s senior Senator at the time, Republican John Warner, also voted for three of the bills. Warner voted ""Nay"" in 2002 along with 14 other Republicans and 14 Democrats.

So this part of Radtke’s statement also is valid.

Let’s move to our final check: that Allen supported No Child Left Behind, former President George W. Bush’s program into install education standards in public schools across the nation.

Sure enough, Allen voted for it. The legislation swept through the Senate on a bipartisan 85-10 vote. Radtke’s right again.

Let’s tally all the votes together.

Radtke said debt increased by $3 trillion during Allen’s Senate term, a figure equal to $16,000 per second. The actual figures were $3.202 trillion, or $16,896.68 per second.

She also said Allen voted to increase the debt ceiling four times, and she’s right. John Warner voted with Allen three of those times, and most of Virginia’s House Republicans supported the  the increases as well. Finally, Radtke is correct in noting that Allen supported the     No Child Left Behind Act. Eighty-four other senators backed the bipartisan bill.

We rate Radtke’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DC3F00>],/factchecks/2011/apr/15/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-george-allen-voted-raise-debt-ce/

TxDOT billboard says a DWI costs you $17,000
","
Along Austin’s Barton Springs Road, home to a stretch of restaurants and drinking establishments, we spotted this head-wrencher on a billboard March 16: ""A DWI costs $17,000.""

Really?

A web site listed on the ad, whosdrivingtonight.com, led us to an online video depicting in Twitter and Facebook posts and text messages a Central Texas woman’s Sept. 17 arrest for driving while intoxicated. The video suggests the incident resulted in 12 hours in jail, two years’ probation, 100 hours of community service, drug and alcohol education classes and the loss of her driver’s license. The person, identified as Jessica, also loses her significant other and then her job after her boss requests a meeting about recent absences.

Entries from a checkbook register show a pile-up of costs including vehicle towing, bail bonds, attorney fees and court costs. Near the video’s end, the account balance is shown as negative $17,422.60. Take-home message: ""Designate a driver.""

Chasing back-up online, we found an Aug. 16, 2010, press release from the Texas Department of Transportation stating: ""Convicted first-time DWI offenders can pay a fine of up to $2,000, lose their driver’s license for up to a year, and serve 180 days in jail. Safety officials say other costs associated with an impaired driving arrest and conviction can add up to more than $17,000 for bail, legal fees, court appearances, court-ordered classes, vehicle insurance increases, and other expenses.""

The release continues: ""Of course, the consequences of driving under the influence can be much worse. In 2009, the latest year of compiled statistics, there were 27,108 alcohol-related crashes in Texas that resulted in 955 deaths and 17,542 injuries (preliminary data).""

There’s no discounting the seriousness of drunken driving and its consequences. Still, we wondered how the state reached the $17,000 figure. Tracie Mendez, TxDOT’s driver behavior program manager, guided us to Austin-based Sherry Matthews Advocacy Marketing, which forwarded the summary of a 2006 study it commissioned from an Austin firm, NuStats, on TxDOT’s behalf.

Cost estimates were reached, the summary says, based on June 2006 interviews of 30 people. They included a representative of the Texas Department of Public Safety and five DWI offenders plus prosecutors, county clerks and defense attorneys in 15 of the state’s most populous counties including Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, Travis, Williamson and Hays.. The summary notes that because individual counties set their own court costs and other fees, ""these costs vary throughout the state.""

Across Texas, the summary states, the ""total costs of a DWI arrest and conviction range from $5,000 to $24,000 for a first-time offense."" In the Austin area, offenders can pay $6,000 to $21,000 in fines, fees and other costs.

Nowhere does the summary specify an average statewide cost--and it cautions against overreaching conclusions. A footnote states: ""Due to the qualitative nature of this study, the interpretation of the results is subject to the limitations of the study parameters. While the findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the costs associated with a first-offense arrest and conviction for DWI, the results are not quantifiable."" Further, the figures ""are not meant to be interpreted as complete and exact.""

In interviews and e-mails, we fielded different explanations of the $17,000 figure from Matthews’ representatives and one executive, Janet Lea, confirmed that the the online video didn’t reflect an actual event; Jessica is not a real person. Lea also said Clay Abbott of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association had expressed comfort with the $17,000 figure.

Abbott, a former prosecutor and defense lawyer, told us he’s a paid consultant to TxDOT and helped the Matthews agency brainstorm and analyze the research. He said his association duties entail training prosecutors and police officers on DWI issues. Abbott confirmed that he endorsed the $17,000 figure, though he also said the high-end attorney fees that showed up in the study struck him as too high. Abbott said he’d be more comfortable with an ad saying a DWI costs up to $24,000, the highest cost figure identified. Yet, he said, ""I know attorneys here in town who are really good who would charge a whole lot less ... and not decrease the effectiveness of your counsel.""

Robert Nash, spokesman for the Matthews' firm, said by e-mail the billboard figure was based on an average of the highest costs for a DWI reported in each of the six studied regions. The actual average approaches $19,200. But ""we decided to reduce the amount to $17,000 since not everyone will pay the maximum,"" Nash said.

Mia Zmud, NuStats’ research director, said by e-mail that the research consisted of ""structured in-depth interviews"" and was not a survey. ""As you point out, because of the qualitative nature of the research methodology conducted for this study, the report does not offer a definitive amount,"" Zmud said. ""However, given that the research was conducted 5 years ago, and the costs have likely gone up, not down,"" $17,000 is a ""plausible figure.""

Separately, we averaged the low-end costs for the regions, getting $6,750. When we averaged the high-end and low-end averages, we got $12,958. Informed of these calculations, Nash said: ""We chose to use a number closer to the higher end -- more persuasive.""

Nash continued: ""Our campaign materials refer to the cost of a DWI without specifically calling it out as a first offense. If someone is arrested and convicted for a second or even third time, the fine alone increases substantially. Not factored in our $17,000 are the auxiliary costs of loss of job or time off from work, loss of driver’s license/transportation, the scram device, the big hike in auto insurance rates for teens"" and so on.

He said too that the $17,000 figure also didn’t include lost income, counseling charges and alternate transportation modes. ""However you choose to look at it, a DWI conviction is expensive, whether we believe it’s $17,000, or you prefer another price. If only one person pays $17,000 for a DWI, saying DWI costs $17,000 is a true statement,"" Nash said.

Separately, we shared the study summary with Austin lawyer Sam Bassett, who said by e-mail that he typically charges $5,000 if a DWI case doesn’t go to a jury and up to $10,000 if it does. Abbott told us fines, set at a judge’s discretion, run from several hundred dollars to $2,000, as they did in 2006.

We also asked Michael Mahometa, a University of Texas statistician, to analyze the study results’ summary. Mahometa said the sample size was too small for anyone to declare statewide cost figures. ""The report was never devised to find how much, on average, are the costs of DWI,"" he said.

Mahometa said an alternative methodology would have been to subtract the $4,792 standard deviation among the regions’ high-end cost totals from the high-end cost average of $19,167, getting $14,375. Yet, he warned by e-mail, a ""better measure would be the average for each region,"" information not in the study summary. Another wrinkle: Since the study was ""a snapshot of 'clean' DWIs - no collision, and no injuries... actual cost (if there was a collision or injury) would actually be higher than the $17,000,"" Mahometa said.

So, how to park this puppy? Our conclusion is the research on which the billboard was based doesn’t justify the flat statement that a DWI costs $17,000. Still, it’s undisputed that some DWI cases can cost defendants a bundle--presumably including costs sometimes adding up to $17,000. We rate the statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A291400>],/factchecks/2011/apr/15/texas-department-transportation/txdot-billboard-says-dwi-costs-you-17000/

Chris Van Hollen says GOP has ""demanded deep cuts"" in education, disease research
","
On the April 10, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., faced off against Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., over the federal budget.

At one point, Van Hollen -- the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee -- criticized Republican spending proposals, saying that the party has targeted popular programs such as education and cancer research.

At the time This Week aired, the details of the budget deal struck two days earlier were still emerging, so Van Hollen said he would ""reserve judgment"" on the language of the final spending bill. But he took a swipe at earlier, Republican-backed spending proposals.

He said that ""the unfortunate part about this entire situation is that Mike and his colleagues threatened to shut down the entire federal government, which would have huge economic dislocation and disruption in the country, in order to pass a bill that, at the end of the day, doesn't create one job. … The Republicans have demanded deep cuts in education. They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases. And instead of focusing just on a narrow slice of cuts that they were demanding, we were able to expand the area of cuts and prevent some (in the budget deal). So that's good news.""

We wondered whether Van Hollen was right when he said that ""the Republicans have demanded deep cuts in education. They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases.""

Van Hollen's remarks were based on H.R. 1, a fiscal year 2011 spending bill that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a 44-56 vote on March 9, 2011. We’re using it because it was a virtually pure Republican proposal: Only three Republicans voted against it on the floor, and no Democrats voted for it.

So, would these programs be cut under H.R. 1? The answer is yes. Here are some of the key areas:

• Title I education spending. This is a program that sends federal funds to the states for K-12 education. H.R. 1 would have cut Title I spending by $693.5 million compared to the amount enacted for fiscal year 2010.

• Part B IDEA grants. This program provides federal funding for special education based on a formula. H.R. 1 would have cut Part B spending by $557.7 million compared to the fiscal year 2010 level.

• Pell grants. This program funds low-income individuals pursuing undergraduate or sometimes graduate degrees. H.R. 1 would have capped the size of Pell grants for the 2011-12 award year at $4,015. Once that amount is adjusted for an additional sum provided under mandatory funding, the maximum level for Pell grants would be $845 lower than today’s level.

• Head Start. This program provides low-income children of preschool age with child-development programs that teach skills that prepare them for school. H.R. 1 would have cut Head Start, which is run by the Department of Health and Human Servcies, by a little under $1.1 billion.

• National Institutes of Heath. NIH is the leading federal institution for conducting research on disease treatments. H.R. 1 would have cut its general budget back to 2008 levels, amounting to a reduction of $639.5 million from fiscal year 2010. In congressional testimony on March 11, 2011, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that the proposed cuts would mean that ""about half of the hundred largest clinical studies including those on cancer and Alzheimer's would probably be canceled.""

When we spoke to Boehner’s office, they didn’t counter the notion that these areas would have been cut if H.R. 1 had been enacted.

""In H.R. 1, we did cut IDEA, Head Start, Title I, Pell grants and NIH,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner. ""The cuts were across all accounts. Nothing was off limits.""

Of course, Republicans have emphasized broader aspects of their bill. In a Feb. 12, 2011, news release about the introduction of H.R. 1, Boehner spoke generally about cutting spending and reducing the size of government, and didn’t mention education and disease research. The statement issued the same day by Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., didn’t get specific, either.

And in a Feb. 15, 2011, floor speech about the bill, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., didn’t mention those programs either. The specific programs he cited were elimination of previous earmark funding from fiscal 2010 and the rescinding of unobligated funding from the stimulus bill.

None of this is remotely surprising -- in the abstract, education and disease research tend to be popular programs. One would expect Republican leaders to play up the more popular aspects of the bill, such as taming the deficit and reducing the size of government, rather than the less popular ones.

By the same token, it's not surprising that Van Hollen highlighted the budget’s impact on education and disease research. It’s the latest incarnation of the old political war-cry that your opponent is targeting widows, orphans and other helpless Americans. But that’s not the whole story. H.R. 1 aimed to cut discretionary spending by $100 billion -- including loads of cuts that had nothing to do with education or disease research.

We do think Van Hollen’s underlying point -- that cuts were made to education and disease research -- is valid. Reasonable people can disagree on whether such cuts are justified, but Van Hollen is well within his rights to point out that these programs would be cut under H.R. 1, just as Republicans are well within their rights to argue that the deficit is so large that every federal program needs to give up some funding. Ultimately, the voters will decide whose priorities hold sway.

In our view, Van Hollen has narrowed the Republicans’ bill, which includes wide-ranging cuts, to just two popular programs. On the other hand, he’s right that those programs would take budget hits under the bill. On balance, we rate his comment Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2917C0>],/factchecks/2011/apr/15/chris-van-hollen/chris-van-hollen-says-gop-has-demanded-deep-cuts-e/

Sen. Marco Rubio says leaders borrowing $4 billion a day to grow government
","
Down-to-the-wire budget negotiations may have avoided a federal government shutdown on April 8, 2011, but those dealings are likely only a precursor to even fiercer partisan bickering over whether to raise the national debt ceiling. President Barack Obama's deficit-reduction speech on April 13, and the GOP reaction to it, was the latest salvo.

The nation’s current debt is creeping closer to the $14.3 trillion cap allowed by law. By May 16, the national debt could exceed the cap, causing the U.S. to default on its obligations, according to an April 5 memo from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to Congress.

Congress has raised the federal debt ceiling nine times in the past 10 years, according to a January 2011 report from the Congressional Research Service. From 1997 to 2001, the debt ceiling remained steady at $5.9 trillion. In 2002, Congress approved raising the cap to $6.4 trillion and has raised it almost every year since as the debt has grown. Republicans have repeatedly said they will not vote to increase the cap again, unless there are measures to ensure future long-term cuts in spending. Democratic leaders have argued that the increase is necessary to avoid sending an already fragile economy back into a tailspin.

On March 30, 2011, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio penned an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal explaining why he does not plan to support raising the debt ceiling.

""I will vote to defeat an increase in the debt limit unless it is the last one we ever authorize and is accompanied by a plan for fundamental tax reform, an overhaul of our regulatory structure, a cut to discretionary spending, a balanced-budget amendment, and reforms to save Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,"" he said.

In the article, Rubio wrote that, ""Leaders of both parties have grown our government for decades by spending money we didn't have. To pay for it, they borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt.""

We were curious if Rubio was correct -- is the U.S. borrowing $4 billion a day to run the government?

Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos offered the following explanation in an e-mail as to how the senator arrived at the $4 billion figure.

""Our budget deficit this year is roughly $1.5 trillion, according to the Congressional Budgeting Office. 1.5 trillion/365 = roughly $4 billion per day.""

The explanation seems rather straightforward, but throughout Rubio’s Wall Street Journal piece, there is only mention of the national debt, not the deficit that he uses to calculate the $4 billion figure.

While the two terms are linked, they are not interchangeable. So we decided to reach out to several economists to get their expert take on Rubio’s mathematics.

First, a primer on the differences between the ""national deficit"" and the ""national debt.""

The deficit is the result of the government spending more in a single budget year than it takes in as revenue from taxes and other sources. The deficit in 2010 was $1.293 trillion, according to the website of the Office of Management and Budget, and we've had a deficit every year since 2002. Before that, from 1998 to 2001, for a brief period at the end of President Bill Clinton's term and the start of President George W. Bush's administration, the federal government was actually operating with a surplus, according to the Congressional Research Service report previously mentioned. 
The national debt, meanwhile, is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia looked at a similar $4 billion-a-day claim recently and described the debt this way: 
There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion (as of April 6). The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show. 
The national debt stretches back to the founding of the country. It was $75 million in 1791, passed $1 billion in 1862 during the Civil War, and topped $1 trillion for the first time in 1982 during President Ronald Reagan's first term. You can see the federal debt at the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of the Public Debt website. For the yearly federal budget deficits (and occasional surpluses) back to 1901, see the Office of Management and Budget's website.

""The debt is the sum of all past deficits,"" said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness.

""When you run a deficit, that adds to your outstanding debt,"" Snaith explained in a phone interview. The deficit ""drives the other one higher. If we didn't run deficits, than we could reduce the debt.""

Snaith said Rubio’s numbers seemed legitimate, though they likely wouldn’t be routinely used by economists.

""The actual borrowing doesn’t occur every day,"" Snaith explained. ""The periodic auction of bonds, that’s when the money is raised. But when you’re dealing with a figure like $1.5 trillion, it’s like a light year, it doesn’t register for many people. To make it a bit more comprehensible, they probably tried to bring it down to a level that is easier to visualize.""

We also turned to David Denslow, an economist with the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Denslow reminded us of another way the deficit and debt are linked: Every year that we have a deficit, the debt grows larger and we have to pay more interest on that debt. ""What we worry about it the accumulating interest,"" he said in an e-mail, referring to it as a ""secondary deficit."" He warned, ""The effect starts out slow, but becomes explosive."" As we noted, interest on the debt was more than $400 billion in 2010. 
While Denslow agreed with the mathematics behind Rubio’s statement, he still suggested the wording could be clearer.

""The phrasing is a bit misleading. I would phrase it, 'To pay for it, they are now borrowing $4 billion a day, raising the debt to $14 trillion,’"" Denslow wrote in an e-mail.

So two experts agree with Rubio’s $4 billion a day figure but quibble over the phrasing. Still, we wondered if it was accurate to refer to deficit spending ""for decades"" and justify it with the deficit over the most recent 365 days. After all, using the OMB list of deficits in the past 10 years, it was $3.5 billion a day in 2010, $1.25 billion a day in 2008 and $680 million a day in 2006.

We posed the question to Marc Goldwein, policy director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

""In terms of when the deficits were created, of course deficits are the result of a variety of tax and spending decisions -- some which have been made in the last few weeks, some which were made in the 1930s,"" Goldwein said. ""But, when the decision is made is a different question from when the money is borrowed. It is being borrowed now."" 
Goldwein's assessment: Rubio's description ""seems to me to be more or less true on average.""

Again, not quite a ringing endorsement. Rubio's statement was that, to pay for government growth over decades, leaders ""borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt."" The sentence mixes a breakdown of the deficit and a total for the debt, and the casual reader could easily confuse the two concepts. We think it would have been more accurate to say that leaders ""borrowed $4 billion a day last year to cover the deficit, pushing today's debt to $14 trillion."" Still, the senator’s calculation works, even though the money isn't really borrowed every single day. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DD8700>],/factchecks/2011/apr/15/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-leaders-borrowing-4-billion/

Chambliss makes case for tax cuts, citing Reagan and Bush
","
Georgia’s senior U.S. senator recently talked about one of the biggest problems facing the federal government -- the national debt -- and offered some solutions.

Saxby Chambliss called for lowering personal income tax rates and corporate tax rates. He then gave a history lesson about how that has worked.

""When we lower tax rates, we generate more in revenues,"" Chambliss, a Republican, told National Public Radio. ""That happened in '86 with the Reagan plan, happened in 2001, following the Bush plan. So we know that's going to happen.""

Chambliss repeated this Monday in a presentation to the Rotary Club of Atlanta.

""What we’ve always seen in this country is whether it was the ‘86 tax package or the 2001 tax package, revenues go up whenwe reduce [tax] rates,"" the senator said.

We wondered whether Chambliss was correct.

Chambliss was referring to two major tax changes by two Republican presidents: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. In 1986, Reagan persuaded Congress to gradually cut the top individual income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 34 percent by 1988. In March 2001, Congress passed the first of several Bush administration tax cuts that he hoped would stimulate the economy.

There’s an ongoing debate about whether tax cuts for the wealthy help boost the economy. Most Republicans say tax cuts help business owners invest more in their companies and on workers. Many Democrats argue those in the highest income tax brackets need tax cuts the least.

President Barack Obama, a Democrat, reluctantly agreed late last year to extend expiring Bush administration tax cuts for wealthy Americans for an additional two years. Obama said in a speech Wednesday that he wants to end those tax cuts as part of a plan to reduce the debt. Republicans quickly objected.

Chambliss spokeswoman Bronwyn Lance Chester said her boss based his comments on federal revenue data from the Office of Management and Budget. The bulk of federal revenue, also called receipts, comes from individual income taxes. A portion comes from businesses in corporate taxes, and some federal revenue comes from taxes on Social Security.

The OMB numbers show federal revenue rose from $769 billion in 1986 to $854 billion in 1987, the year after the Reagan-era tax changes were passed. It rose again in 1988 to $909 billion.

The revenue change wasn’t as rosy following the 2001 tax cuts. In 2001, revenue was just below $2 trillion. The following year, revenue was $1.85 trillion. In 2003, revenue went even lower to $1.78 trillion.

We also looked at revenue as a percentage of the nation’s gross domestic product. The percentage rose from 17.5 percent to 18.4 percent between fiscal years 1986 and 1987. It dropped slightly in 1988 to 18.2 percent. The percentage dropped from 19.5 percent in fiscal year 2001 to 17.6 percent in fiscal year 2002 and 16.2 percent in fiscal year 2003. The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.

Eric Toder, a former official in the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and the Congressional Budget Office, noted that the Reagan-era tax rate changes were not aimed at raising revenue, which is consistent with news reports from 1986. As for the Bush tax cuts, Toder, an institute fellow at the Washington-based Urban Institute, said it’s not accurate to claim there was an increase in revenue, pointing to the OMB’s revenue figures.

Lance Chester told us revenue increases were ""delayed due to the economic recession at the time.""

""But revenues did show a steady increase afterward,"" she added in an e-mail.

Total revenue did not increase until 2004, according to the OMB data. Revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product did not rise again until fiscal year 2005, OMB data show.

We asked Toder and Sally Wallace, the chairwoman of Georgia State University’s economics department, whether Chambliss should get a pass on what he said about the Bush tax cuts, taking into consideration the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. They both said no, arguing it did not have a devastating impact on the economy.

We were curious about what happened after another recent disaster in America. In fiscal year 2006, the year after Hurricane Katrina, revenue and its percentage of the gross domestic product actually increased, OMB data show.

Wallace, a former Treasury Department official, looked at data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Brookings Institution, a well-known independent public policy foundation. Her numbers were slightly different with OMB’s but also led her to the conclusion that revenue rose in 1987 and fell in 2002.

Wallace disagreed with the Chambliss camp’s argument about the recession’s impact on 2002 revenue, noting that they were still down in 2003 when the economy showed signs of growth.

""Revenue should have rebounded after 2003, but it did not,"" she told us.

We believe Chambliss is correct to say that federal revenue did rise after Reagan lowered individual income tax rates, but we note that his plan was aimed at being revenue-neutral. The numbers show federal revenue declined in the first two years after the 2001 Bush administration tax cuts, so the senator’s statement is off.

The senator’s statement is partially accurate, but it omits some important details. Therefore, we rate it as Half-True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F07D40>],/factchecks/2011/apr/15/saxby-chambliss/chambliss-makes-case-tax-cuts-citing-reagan-and-bu/

 Petition claims killing individual coyotes doesn’t effectively curb their populations
","
Coyotes have people howling mad on Aquidneck Island.

Middletown residents recently packed a meeting to tell town officials how alarmed they are by  coyotes boldly stalking neighborhoods, leaping fences into backyards and snatching beloved pets. Action is needed, they demanded, before one of the notoriously sly predators maims or kills a small child.

But the solution that the residents convinced the town to approve April 4 -- enlisting the services of a hunter to kill coyotes -- has infuriated others. Several hundred residents have signed a petition opposing the plan.

""The Town of Middletown has hired a hunter to begin a systematic mass killing of the coyotes,"" the petition reads. ""What they do not take into consideration is that for every one they kill, the population will replace and usually multiply the numbers,"" reads the petition.

That second part sounded so counter-intuitive -- after all, didn’t we hunt buffalo and wolves to near extinction? -- that we decided to look into it.

But first we have to dispense with the statement about the ""mass killing"" of coyotes in Middletown. 
As far as we know, no one has suggested that the goal is to kill huge numbers of coyotes. At the April 4 meeting, Police Chief Anthony Pesare said the town would hire just one hunter to target coyotes that have lost their fear of humans. The hunter, he said, would be teamed up with Numi Mitchell,  who since 2005 has been running the Narragansett Bay Coyote Study.

Had we run this statement through the Truth-O-Meter, it  would have rated a False ruling. But we were more interested in the petition’s claim that killing coyotes just leads the animals to ""replace and usually multiply the numbers.""

First we called Shana Gaines, a Newport woman and vintage clothing store owner, who started the petition. She said she based the text on remarks by Mitchell, whose team has been placing radio collars on coyotes and tracking them to better understand their habits.

Mitchell, after confirming her advisory role in the Middletown initiative, referred us to several research studies, including those by Frederick F. Knowlton, who spent 45 years studying coyotes and other wildlife with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Service and as a professor at Utah State University. His work, much of it relating to coyote attacks on livestock, is commonly cited in scientific papers.

""Local population reduction can provide temporary relief to sheep operators, but only until the local coyote population compensates for the removals and fills vacant territories. … Population reduction as a management option usually requires annual reapplications due to the reproductive capabilities and ease of movement of coyotes,"" he and his co-authors wrote in one 1999 paper.

Kim Murray Berger, another researcher who has studied coyotes, wolves and other predators, wrote in a 2006 paper that although systematic campaigns to kill predators have ""threatened"" such species as wolves, coyotes ""have shown remarkable resilience.""

The scientific explanation that is commonly given is intriguing.

""It’s called responsive reproduction,"" said Christine Schadler, a wild-canid ecologist and teacher who is the New England representative for the advocacy group Project Coyote. ""It seems very mysterious. How can you shoot and shoot and shoot and wind up with more? It doesn’t seem intuitive at all.""

But here’s what happens, she said. Coyotes typically live in a pack that stakes out, and protects, a territory. Packs are led by an alpha male and female, which are the only breeders among the group. When stressed by a limited amount of food, the females produce litters with fewer pups.

But when the size of a pack is reduced, there’s more food for each individual. And breeding becomes more prolific. Their numbers bounce back in a year or two, she said.

Coyotes have expanded from western parts of the country, despite attempts to reduce their numbers there, and spread to the East, taking advantage of the decline in wolf populations, a natural territorial competitor.

""In a hundred years of trying to control the coyotes, all we’ve done is create millions more,"" Schadler said. ""There’s not a scientific article that can dispute that.""

A New Hampshire sheep raiser, Schadler ""educates"" the local coyote pack to feel threatened by humans -- in ways that are not harmful to the animals. That, along with good fences and other deterrents, has prevented her from losing any sheep. All experts on coyotes caution against intentionally or unintentionally providing coyotes a source of food.

We searched for someone who might argue that killing coyotes can reduce populations.

We called Wildlife Services, a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The office readily acknowledges overseeing the killing of tens of thousands of coyotes every year, much to the chagrin of wildlife advocates.

But even Carol Bannerman, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not advocate killing coyotes simply to reduce populations. The agency responds to complaints of damage being caused by coyotes, such as livestock losses, with an ""integrated management plan"" that emphasizes non-lethal methods to ward off coyotes.

Where does that leave us?

Bannerman, Middletown officials and Mitchell all appear to embrace the idea, to some degree, that the targeted killing of coyotes too comfortable around humans can help deal with isolated problems.

""This is just a short-term solution for a couple of individual coyotes,"" Mitchell said.

Knowlton, the Utah expert, said local reduction programs can provide temporary relief from coyote problems.

But, in general, wildlife advocates and scientific studies maintain that coyotes are such prolific breeders that trying to lower their numbers by killing them is ineffective.

So it appears the petition, apart from the ""mass killing"" falsehood,  wasn’t feeding us a pack of lies after all. We rate the claim about coyotes replenishing their numbers Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A42A00>],/factchecks/2011/apr/15/online-petition/petition-claims-killing-individual-coyotes-doesnt-/

Obama says incomes increased more than $250,000 for top 1 percent of Americans, dropped for bottom 90 percent
","
In his April 13, 2011, speech on his vision for America’s fiscal future, President Barack Obama made it clear that, although he agreed to an extension of the President George W. Bush tax cuts in a compromise deal at the end of 2010, he will resume his fight to end Bush's tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 a year. 
Obama justified his position, in part, on the following statistic:

""In the last decade, the average income of the bottom 90 percent of all working Americans actually declined,"" Obama said. ""The top 1 percent saw their income rise by an average of more than a quarter of a million dollars each.""

This turns out to be a controversial statistic, so we decided to check it out.

According to the White House press office, Obama's statistic is based on an analysis of IRS data on pre-tax income by economists Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and Emmanuel Saez at the University of California at Berkeley.

According to their analysis, the inflation-adjusted average income for the bottom 90 percent fell by $1,170 between 2002 and 2008 (a 4 percent decrease); while the average income for those on the top 1 percent rose by $261,930 (a 30 percent increase).

The Piketty-Saez analysis is widely cited in economic circles, but it is not without its detractors.

One of the most frequent and vocal critics has been Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. In a phone interview, Reynolds said that the Piketty-Saez analysis looks at income before taxes, including capital gains, and excludes ""transfer payments,"" such as  social security and unemployment benefits.

""That's a fairly problematic thing,"" Reynolds said, as it leaves out a lot of personal income such as refundable tax credits. ""If you leave out transfer payments, you leave out a big part of the story.""

In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on Dec. 23, 2010, titled, ""Taxes and the Top Percentile Myth,"" Reynolds argued the Piketty-Saez figures ""tell us nothing about whether the top percentile pays too much or too little in income taxes.""

In a published response to Reynolds' criticism, Piketty and Saez countered that nothing in Reynolds' critique invalidated their findings and that Reynolds' arguments ""contain serious misunderstandings on our academic work.""

We're not going to wade too deeply into the fray between groups of economists. But we thought it would be helpful to note some of the caveats and assumptions contained in Obama's claim and to point to some other independent data related to the subject of income distribution.

For one, the U.S. Census Bureau provides survey data on mean household incomes, but the data does not allow for a clean analysis of Obama's claim. The census reports on the mean household income received by each fifth of the population (which means they don't look at the ""bottom 90 percent""). It also doesn't have a large enough sample to break out the top 1 percent, though it does give data on the Top 5 percent. Between 2002 and and 2008 (which we are citing for the sake of consistency), mean incomes increased in all the fifths of the population (contrary to the Piketty-Saez analysis which found incomes dropped for the bottom 90 percent). The census data also shows that the mean income for the top 5 percent rose from $251,010 in 2002 to $295,388 in 2008. That's not as dramatic a picture as the one portrayed by Obama, but again, Obama talked about the top 1 percent, and the Census figures are for the top 5 percent. Piketty and Saez argue the disparities rise considerably as you narrow the window from the top 5 percent to the top 1 percent.

In addition, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office presents average pre-tax and after-tax household income for just the top 1 percent, but only through 2007. According to the CBO report, after-tax household income for the top 1 percent went from $1,038,700 in 2000 to $730,500 in 2002, and then to $1,319,700 in 2007. The CBO does not provide 2008 data, where we would expect to see a significant dip due to the recession. In other words, the results depend greatly on which years you choose.

In an analysis of the Piketty-Saez data by the left-leaning Center on Budget Policy Priorities, Hannah Shaw and Chad Stone acknowledged that ""the IRS data used by Piketty and Saez have some limitations, one of the most important of which is that they do not include people who do not file income tax returns.""

In addition, they note, ""neither Piketty-Saez nor Census adjusts incomes for family size, which can distort trends when average family size is changing over time.""

The CBO report does adjust for family size, they wrote, and so it ""provides the most comprehensive analysis of income distribution, but is not as timely as the Piketty-Saez analysis"" because it only goes to 2007 (pre-recession, which hit the wealthy hard).

We'd like to point out one other issue. Obama framed his statistic as ""in the last decade,"" yet his press office referred to analysis between 2002 and 2008. Decisions about what years to include or not include can make a big difference.

When we asked Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, about the accuracy of Obama's claim, he looked at Piketty-Saez figures between 1998 and 2008 -- in other words, the latest data available for a full decade.

""The estimates imply real average income (before taxes) fell 4.2 percent between 1998-2008 in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution,"" Burtless wrote in an e-mail. ""In the same period they increased 17.7 percent ($136,344) in the top 1 percent of the income distribution between the same years.""

If you look instead at the period between 2000 and 2008, Burtless said, real average income (before taxes) fell 7.7 percent in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution, while it increased 3.4 percent in the top 1 percent of the income distribution between the same years.

""This justifies the President’s statement on the direction of change in pre-tax incomes in the two groups, but I do not know how his staff calculated that the average income gain per person in the top 1 percent exceeded $250,000,"" Burtless said.

It takes a careful selection of years (and not even a full decade at that), and a number of assumptions about income for Obama's statistic to hold up. We rate the president's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B0840>],/factchecks/2011/apr/14/barack-obama/obama-says-incomes-increased-more-250000-top-1-per/

Barack Obama says U.S. interest load will hit nearly $1 trillion by end of decade
","
During his April 13, 2011, speech on his vision for America’s fiscal future, President Barack Obama offered a striking statistic about the future burden of interest on the national debt.

""Even after our economy recovers,"" Obama said, ""our government will still be on track to spend more money than it takes in throughout this decade and beyond. That means we’ll have to keep borrowing more from countries like China. And that means more of your tax dollars will go toward paying off the interest on all the loans we keep taking out. By the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion. Just the interest payments.""

We thought we’d check whether Obama was correct that ""by the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion.""

We turned to figures published by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of fiscal statistics and projections. Specifically, we looked at CBO’s analysis, published in March, of Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal.

In that report, CBO offered two different projections for what the interest burden would be by the end of the decade. One of the projections looks at what would happen under Obama’s proposal. The other projection is known as the ""baseline"" budget. The baseline budget estimates what needs to be spent to maintain current services. It includes the effects of inflation, and it assumes that current law will continue indefinitely.

Baselines can be a useful measure, but they are not perfect. Adhering to current law requires the assumption that Congress will let a number of policies expire, including the Bush tax cuts, periodic adjustments to limit the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax and delays to scheduled Medicare reimbursement cuts to physicians. There’s no certainty that Congress and the president will follow through with these phase-outs, given the political support for them, so the baseline budget likely underestimates the size of future deficits.

Despite such imperfections, we thought that both scenarios were relevant for judging the president’s statement, so we’ll offer the figures for both. We’ll also offer figures for both 2019 and 2020, since we couldn’t come up with an answer to the question of what year constitutes the ""end of this decade.""

Let’s look first at the president’s budget proposal.

CBO says that during 2019, net interest costs will reach $794 billion. By 2020, the number reaches $866 billion.

Now, we’ll look at the baseline budget.

CBO says that during 2019, net interest costs will reach $710 billion. By 2020, the number reaches $762 billion.

None of these four estimates reaches $1 trillion. The closest number is off by 13 percent, and the lowest is off by 29 percent.

Marc Goldwein, policy director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the president is not far off, especially given the high degree of uncertainty about what the law will be a decade from now.

Other experts we spoke to said the White House had to stretch to reach the flashy $1 trillion figure.

Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said that ""$710 billion or $762 billion is a lot of money, but it's not ‘nearly $1 trillion.’""

The White House pointed us to a third possibility -- the interest burden in 2021. Why 2021? That’s the final year of the decadelong ""budget window."" CBO estimated interest in 2021 to be $931 billion -- closer to $1 trillion than any of our other numbers, and possibly enough to justify Obama’s wording of ""nearly $1 trillion.""

Still, we think most listeners wouldn’t immediately assume the president is talking about budget windows when he says ""by the end of this decade."" Using the figures for 2019 or 2020 instead, Obama’s numbers are off by anywhere from 13 percent to 29 percent. Obama’s underlying point is still sound -- the United States will have hundreds of billions of dollars of debt on the books -- but we think the most obvious numbers fall short of ""nearly $1 trillion."" On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097028FC0>],/factchecks/2011/apr/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-interest-load-will-hit-nearly/

Liberal group says Eric Cantor wants to eliminate Social Security
","
A new television ad taking aim at U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor’s position on Social Security gives us a sense of deja vu.

The Campaign for America’s Future, a liberal advocacy group, has aired the television ad this month in Cantor’s 7th District saying the congressman is a threat to the retirement dreams of Americans younger than 55.

""Congressman Eric Cantor wants to eliminate Social Security,"" the narrator intones in the 31-second spot, based on a comment the majority leader made in a March 21 appearance before the conservative Hoover Institution.

The ad supports the claim with an audio snippet of Cantor’s response to a question from the audience. Speaking about entitlement programs such as Social Security, Cantor said it’s important to protect benefits for those 55 and older.

""But for the rest of us, listen, we’re going to have to come to grips with the fact that these programs cannot exist if we want America to be what we want America to be,"" Cantor said.

In recent weeks, scads of liberal politicians, organizations and bloggers have been pouncing on the same statement to argue it’s evidence the GOP is showing its true intentions to end Social Security.

One of groups, Americans United for Change, used the comment to argue Cantor wanted to eliminate Social Security and Medicare.

In an April 1 Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact national rated that claim False, pointing out that in other public appearances Cantor has called for changing, not abolishing entitlement programs like Social Security.

Seconds after making the Hoover statement that sparked the frenzy, Cantor added:

""We’re going to have to accept some changes as far as the rest of us, and what we’re saying is for those 55 and older (they) do not have to worry about changes in benefits, but for the rest of us we will,"" Cantor said.

There are other statements showing Cantor envisions a future with Social Security:

*In a Feb. 19 op-ed in Politico, he said the country’s entitlement programs ""will not be available for our children unless they are modernized and reformed.""

*In a March 16 interview with CNBC, he said, ""If you look at these entitlement programs, what we’ve got to admit to ourselves is they’re not going to be around in their current state unless we significantly alter who we are as a country."" He said that for workers 54 and younger, Republicans were going to insist on dealing ""with the fact that if these programs are going to be around, they’re going to have to look a lot different.""

*In the April 13 Richmond Times-Dispatch, Cantor again said if programs like Social Security are to remain viable, they must change for those under 55. ""We want them to be around because we care about those who need our help,"" Cantor said. ""We want a safety net in place that actually is there for people who need it, not for those who don’t.""

Robert L. Borosage, the co-director of the Campaign for America’s Future, sent us an email insisting Cantor does want to end Social Security and saying his comment at Hoover isn’t the only proof.

Borosage sent us a link to a portion of an April 10 appearance Cantor made on Fox News Sunday. While talking about the Republican 2012 budget plan and entitlements, Cantor said ""I know those programs are not going to be there for me when I retire, just like everyone else 54 and younger. They can’t. We can’t sustain that kind of trajectory.""

But a review of the full interview on Fox showed that as Cantor talked about the House GOP 2012 budget, he also said Republicans are ""talking about changing the way that the entitlements work in this country for the future while protecting today’s seniors.""

Cantor has been short on specifics about how he would reform Social Security.

Let’s recap:

The Campaign for America’s Future used part of a comment Cantor made at the Hoover Institution to argue the congressman wants to eliminate Social Security for those under 55..

But Cantor had a made a number of statements, previous to the ad, which show that is not his position. The Majority Leader has said the program must be changed  to remain viable, not eliminated, even though he has been short on specifics about how he would reform Social Security.

It would have been easy for the Campaign for America’s Future to find those statements before they ran the ad. Instead, they cherry-picked a Cantor comment and gave it no context. We rate their statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A2B200>],/factchecks/2011/apr/14/campaign-americas-future/liberal-groups-say-eric-cantor-wants-eliminate-soc/

When NASA announced where its four retired space shuttle orbiters would be permanently housed -- at the Smithsonian’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington, in New York, in Los Angeles, and at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida -- the two most disappointed candidates were Texas and Ohio.

Both were considered favorites to land a spacecraft, from a field that included more than 20 cities.

Texas staked its claim largely on being home to NASA's Mission Control. Ohio is not only home to the Wright Brothers, pioneering astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong and NASA's Glenn Research Center, but is the site of the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Wright Patterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton. That’s where the shuttle would have been housed.

""Unfortunately, it looks like regional diversity amounts to which coast you are on, or which exit you use on I-95,"" jeered Sen. Sherrod Brown, who joined the rest of Ohio's congressional delegation in calling for a federal investigation into the selection process.

Members of Ohio’s congressional delegation jointly urged NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden to select the museum as a home for the shuttle because of it’s location.

""Within a day’s drive of 60 percent of the U.S. population, the museum is easily accessible to millions from across the American heartland, hosting more than 1.3 million visitors annually,"" they wrote in a letter April 30, 2010.

The 60 percent figure is one PolitiFact Ohio has heard several times. Brown and Rep. Steve Austria both repeated it in recent days. 
For purposes of this item we’re attributing it to Rep. Michael Turner, a Republican from Dayton whose congressional district is home to the museum. Turner was the lead signer on the letter, but he was joined by all of Ohio’s representatives and senators.

Going back 150 years, and as recently as 1940, the population center point of the entire nation was in Ohio. But population drift, and the coastal tilt of NASA's decision, made us wonder if the claim still flew. And how far is ""a day's drive,"" anyway?

We traced the claim from the NASA letter  to a statement on Dayton's municipal website. It said the city is ""located within 500 miles of 60 percent of (the) U.S. population.""

That statement linked to a business story from the Dayton Daily News. It quoted Wright State University Professor Dwight Smith-Daniels on the subject of centroids: places that have a high proportion of a country’s population and a high proportion of its manufacturing, generally within 500 miles. He said Columbus/Dayton and the Riverside, Calif., areas are the two in the United States, making them important for supply chain managment in business.

But he phrased it differently. ""Ohio is within 500 miles of 60 percent of the country’s population,"" he said.

Smith-Daniels’ comment gave us actual mileage for ""a day's drive."" It also made the claim for Ohio -- a big state -- and not just a site in one corner of it. And that make a big difference.

We tested both versions using U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2010 census (numbers slightly more current than what Smith-Daniels would have had available).

Working from the bureau's website, we identified all counties whose centers are located within 500 miles of Ohio's borders.The area reaches northwest beyond Minneapolis and east to include nearly all of New England and the eastern seaboard. They totaled 171.4 million people, or 56 percent of the U.S. population of 308.7 million.

That estimate rounds to 60 percent, which is what the professor said.

Then we identified all counties whose centers are located within 500 miles of the museum in Ohio's southwest corner. Their population totaled 130.5 million people, or 42 percent of the U.S. population.

By our assessment, that means the congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats alike, went too far by applying a claim for the whole state to just Dayton. A 500-mile range from the museum reaches across New Jersey, but doesn’t take in New York city or New England.

The congressional delegation’s underlying point was accurate -- a large portion of the U.S. population would be within driving distance of a shuttle in Dayton. But by narrowing the starting point for the range from the entire state, as Smith-Daniels used, to just the museum, they also eliminated more than 40 million of people.

Then again, they also were smart enough not to say how far they’d drive in a day.

With that important detail mentioned, we rate the claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7E3C0>],/factchecks/2011/apr/14/michael-turner/rep-michael-turner-congressional-delegation/

Mike Pence said Republican Medicare proposal gives seniors the same health care as Congress
","Correction: This item was originally published at about noon on April 13, 2011, based on ABC's transcript of ""This Week With Christiane Amanpour."" Shortly afterward, Pence's press office notified us that the transcript text was wrong -- leaving out the words ""kind of.""  Listening to the exchange on video, we confirmed the error in our original ruling. As a result, we are republishing this item at about 6 p.m. on April 13 with the correct quote from Pence and have upgraded the ruling from False to Barely True. Republicans have better proposals than Democrats to rein in future federal spending, said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., in an appearance on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour. ""House Republicans under Paul Ryan's leadership have offered a vision to put America back on a pathway toward a balanced budget,"" Pence said. ""It deals with issues in entitlements. It reduces the national debt. For Americans 55 or older, we're not proposing a single change in Medicare... What we want to do for Americans under the age of 55 is make sure they can participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do."" Pence’s final claim about Medicare drew a response from Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who was also on the show. ""That is not accurate,"" Van Hollen said. ""Members of Congress have what is called a fair-share deal. We do not bear the entire risk of increased costs. They are asking seniors to bear risks (that) they are not asking themselves."" Pence replied, ""Members of Congress have the same premium support system, Chris knows that."" We decided to see who was right by fact-checking Pence’s statement that future Medicare beneficiaries will be able to ""participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do."" The Medicare proposal Pence and Van Hollen mentioned comes from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chair of the House Budget Committee. His 2012 budget proposal, called The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America’s Promise, lays out many ways to reduce federal spending, including changes to entitlement programs including Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for Americans 65 or older. Right now, Medicare is a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.) Under Ryan’s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government ""premium support"" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (Ryan’s plan specifically says this is not a ""voucher"" program, since the government will pay the insurance companies directly.) Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care. Here’s how Ryan’s plan explains it: ""When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks."" Ryan’s proposal requires the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which is how members of Congress buy their insurance. Additionally, Ryan’s plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium supports to high earners. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found that it will save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more to buy insurance. ""A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare,"" the CBO concluded. Now let’s look at how whether proposal looks like what members of Congress can buy. • How the plan is like what members of Congress get. We contacted Pence’s office to ask about how the Ryan proposal is like what members of Congress get, and they pointed us to the fact that Medicare plans from private insurers will be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as do plans that cover members of Congress. We should also note that seniors would be able to compare different plans and select from different insurance options, as members of Congress do. The government would pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress. • How the plan is not like what members of Congress get. First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.) Second, as Van Hollen pointed out, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise their rates, through a formula he mentioned known as ""Fair Share."" Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent. Federal support for premiums in Ryan’s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs. Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some, but we feel it’s important to mention: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000. Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""As policymakers consider options for decreasing federal Medicare spending and addressing the federal debt and deficit, this analysis raises questions about the extent to which the next generation of Medicare beneficiaries will be able to bear a larger share of costs,"" the foundation concluded in an April 2011 report. Our ruling We should emphasize that Ryan’s Medicare proposal is only a broad outline right now, and there are many unanswered questions about it. But what we do know about it strikes us as fundamentally different from the kind of employer-provided health insurance that members of Congress receive. At a minimum, the premium supports will not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income than members of Congress and will likely not have the same options to buy more expensive plans. And, finally, they will not the same protection against rising costs that ""Fair Share"" provides members of Congress. We rate Pence’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1cb004d0-c238-4451-80ba-373db17dc6f7",[<zip object at 0x00000280970433C0>],/factchecks/2011/apr/13/mike-pence/mike-pence-said-republican-medicare-proposal-will-/

Barack Obama says foreign aid makes up 1 percent of U.S. budget
","
President Barack Obama’s April 13 speech on federal debt and spending contained plenty of interesting claims, and we’ll be checking those in the coming days.

We wanted to start with with a remark the president made to back up his contention that politicians often focus their deficit-cutting rhetoric on hot-button programs that are just a small portion of the federal budget.

Politicians in both parties, he said, ""suggest that we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about 1% of our entire budget.""

We wondered if foreign aid really makes up such a small portion of federal spending.

In February, PolitiFact checked a claim by Ross Douthat, a columnist at The New York Times. Douthat said Israel and Egypt receive more foreign aid from Uncle Sam than any other nations. We rated that True, noting that if you exclude the spending on Afghanistan and Iraq, where military operations continue, Israel received $2.4 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, while Egypt got $1.5 billion.

Those 2008 figures came from the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract. The United States spent a total $49.1 billion on foreign aid that year. According to the Treasury Department and historical tables on the federal budget, total federal spending was $2.98 trillion for the 2008 fiscal year. That means foreign aid made up 1.64 percent of budget.

What about 2009? In that fiscal year, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the United States spent $44.9 billion, while overall government spending was $3.52 trillion. Foreign aid spending was 1.28 percent of the total budget.

If you’re wondering who else is a major U.S. aid recipient, here’s the rest of the top 10 from 2008: Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). The totals reflect both economic and military aid.

So Obama was almost exactly right in saying foreign aid consumes about 1 percent of the U.S. budget. In fiscal 2008 U.S. foreign aid spending of $49.1 billion made up 1.64 percent of total spending. The next year foreign aid spending was $44.9 billion, or 1.28 percent of the total budget.

We rate the president’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097203E40>],/factchecks/2011/apr/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-foreign-aid-makes-1-percent-us-b/
"['National', 'Homeland Security', 'Terrorism', 'Tim Pawlenty']","
Tim Pawlenty says Obama has stopped using the phrase ""war on terror""
","
In his book Courage to Stand, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a potential GOP presidential candidate, said President Barack Obama ""needs to do a more forceful job of reminding people about the threat of global terrorism.""

And that needs to start with calling it by its real name, Pawlenty wrote.

""Sadly, President Obama will not call this effort what it is,"" Pawlenty wrote. ""He has stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' His administration never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently that isn't politically correct. The fact is, radical Islamic terrorism exists. Pointing that out doesn't condemn all Muslims. But there is an element of Islam that is radical and that has terrorist intentions. We need to call it what it is. We need to confront it, and we need to defeat it.""

This isn't the first time Obama has been accused of ducking the phrase ""war on terror"" or for not attaching the words Islamic or Muslim when talking about violent extremists.

Back in November 2009, we checked into a similar claim from Fox News' Sean Hannity that ""Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.' "" 
Back then, we did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase ""war on terrorism"" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. Early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase ""war on terror,"" but only a couple of times. 
And it's true that Obama made a conscious and deliberate decision early in his presidency to avoid the phrase ""war on terror"" in favor of more precise language. 
Obama explained his reasoning in several interviews. 
During a Jan. 27, 2009, interview with Obama, Hisham Melhem of Arabic-language television news station al-Aribiya noted that Obama seemed to eschew President George W. Bush's phrase ""war on terror"" and ""frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators."" 
Said Obama: ""I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.

""And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.

""But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship."" 
The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper: 
Cooper: ""I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?"" 
Obama: ""Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds."" 
Cooper: ""So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?"" 
Obama: ""You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life. 
Based on those facts, we rated Hannity's claim True. But when former Vice president Dick Cheney took the meme a step further and alleged that Obama will not ""admit we're at war,"" we rated Cheney's claim Pants in Fire.  
Here, Pawlenty's claim is closer to Hannity's. So first we checked Obama's public statements since our previous fact-check to see if he has stuck to this line and avoided the phrase ""war on terror"" or anything like ""radical Islamic terrorism."" And he has. 
In May 2010, John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, addressed the topic in some detail: 
""The president’s strategy is absolutely clear about the threat we face,"" Brennan said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Our enemy is not 'terrorism' because terrorism is but a tactic.  Our enemy is not 'terror' because terror is a state of mind, and as Americans we refuse to live in fear.  Nor do we describe our enemy as 'jihadists' or 'Islamists' because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenant of Islam, meaning to purify oneself or one’s community, and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women and children.
 
""Indeed, characterizing our adversaries this way would actually be counterproductive. It would play into the false perception that they are religious leaders defending a holy cause, when in fact they are nothing more than murderers, including the murder of thousands upon thousands of Muslims."" 
""Moreover,"" Brennan said, ""describing our enemy in religious terms would lend credence to the lie—propagated by al-Qaida and its affiliates to justify terrorism—that the United States is somehow at war against Islam. The reality, of course, is that we never have been and will never be at war with Islam. After all, Islam, like so many faiths, is part of America.

""Instead, the president’s strategy is clear and precise. Our enemy is al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. For it was al-Qaida who attacked us so viciously on 9/11 and whose desire to attack the United States, our allies, and our partners remains undiminished. And it is its affiliates who have taken up al-Qaida’s call to arms against the United States in other parts of the world.

""The president’s strategy is unequivocal with regard to our posture. The United States of America is at war. We are at war against al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. That is why the president is responsibly ending the war in Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9/11, and why he has refocused our efforts on Afghanistan, where al-Qaida continues to plot from the tribal regions along the border with Pakistan and inside of Pakistan.""

More recently, in remarks at the Adams Center, a nonprofit that runs community centers and mosques, on March 6, 2011, Denis McDonough, deputy national security adviser to the president, spoke about the strategy of the Obama administration's words.

""President Obama recognizes that through our words and deeds we can either play into al-Qaida’s narrative and messaging, or we can challenge it and thereby undermine it,"" McDonough said. ""We’re determined to undermine it.""

In his book, Pawlenty claims Obama has stopped using the phrase ""war on terror"" and his administration ""never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism."" We found several instances in which Vice President Joe Biden has talked about ""radical extremism"" or ""radical fundamentalism"" and the need to aggressively confront ""violent extremism and radical ideologies."" But he never attaches the words ""Islamic"" to those phrases. And neither has Obama. As Obama and members of his administration have repeatedly explained, this is a very conscious decision to be more precise about the enemy, al-Qaida and other terrorist affiliates and not to feed into the al-Qaida message that America is somehow at war with Islam. You may agree or disagree with Obama's word choices, or with Pawlenty's, but Pawlenty is correct about Obama's deliberate decision not to use the phrases ""war on terror"" or ""radical Islamic terrorism.""

Twists and turns, but No Flip on central funding question
","
(Editor’s note: PolitiFact has a policy of correcting errors of fact and, when appropriate, reviewing conclusions we have reached based on relevant and persuasive new information.

After this item ran April 13, 2011, aides to Gov. Scott Walker asked us to reconsider our original ruling of a Half Flip, specifically as it relates to Walker’s statements on the use of stimulus money for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee link.

We asked editors who were not part of the original ruling panel to review the item. Based on their view and additional discussion we have decided a rating of No Flip is warranted. This item has been rewritten to fit that ruling.) 


When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced March 29, 2011, he would seek federal funding for upgrades to Amtrak’s Hiawatha train service between Chicago and Milwaukee, it stirred plenty of attention.

After all, Walker was asking the feds for a portion of the same $810 million in stimulus money for a Milwaukee-to-Madison high-speed rail link he campaigned against, and then refused. And some of the money for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee upgrades was included in the earlier grant.

The Hiawatha makes seven round trips a day between Milwaukee and Chicago and has seen steadily increasing ridership, with 741,000 passengers in 2010. Wisconsin is seeking $150 million to buy two additional train sets and eight locomotives as part of the upgrades.

Among others, Milwaukee Ald. Bob Bauman, a supporter of the original grant, criticized Walker for seeking the new money, calling the move ""rank hypocrisy.""

So, did Walker change his tune on trains?

Time for a visit to the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter.

Here’s our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter doesn’t measure whether any change in position was good policy -- or good politics. It just looks at whether a politician has been consistent along the way.

In this case, we are focusing on the statements that relate to the Chicago-to-Milwaukee link and the use of stimulus money for it. Walker intertwined the two when he announced the application.

As with the Madison-to-Milwaukee link, the stimulus money is for high-speed rail service, though the upgrades that have been discussed would not bring to that status until years from now.

To be sure, there are numerous ironies involved in the hotly debated issue, from Walker’s past criticism of the federal stimulus program in general to now seeking some of the money he once rejected.

What’s more, a portion of the federal money Walker is now seeking would be used to build a maintenance facility in Milwaukee at the Talgo factory in Milwaukee. Talgo is the company that had a contract to build the trains that would run between Milwaukee and Madison -- a contract Walker criticized in 2010 as a gubernatorial candidate.

After the federal government yanked funding for the Milwaukee-to-Madison project because of Walker’s opposition, Talgo said it would complete work already under way and then move production work out of Milwaukee.

Now, the Talgo factory is a key part of Walker’s plan.

The new state application includes $50 million to $60 million for the maintenance facility. That’s up from $30 million that the state previously agreed to spend on the facility. Walker says spending more on the maintenance facility will save state taxpayers $20 million.

Here’s the reasoning:

The state’s existing contract with Talgo committed the state to spending at least $30 million on a maintenance base. That was to have been located in Madison, as part of the now-dead train service. The new application calls for a bigger facility at the Talgo plant in Milwaukee. Walker wants the feds to pay at least 80 percent, or $48 million, toward the base. The state would pay $10 million to $12 million.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said that means taxpayers are saving between $18 million and $20 million, because if the state does nothing, it’s already on the hook for $30 million under the previous deal with Talgo.

Of course, Wisconsin residents who pay federal taxes would still be doing their part to foot the bill.

Let’s return to the core question: With the new application, did Walker switch tracks?

Walker certainly didn’t want to extend the service to Madison.

But he and virtually everyone else -- including Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and the business community -- likes the Milwaukee-to-Chicago service.

Here are a couple of examples of what Walker said about that train: 
Indeed, in his news release announcing the application, Walker framed the new application as a money saver -- in contrast to his view the Milwaukee-to-Madison extension was a money loser for the state, which would have had to pay an ongoing subsidy.

So, there’s nothing inconsistent on this part of the question.

But what about the use of federal stimulus money?

In February 2009, Walker was critical of the stimulus program in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, saying: ""As popular as the federal ‘stimulus’ package is with Washington politicians, it is more popular among state and local politicians who view federal money as a cure for their fiscal woes.""

In the piece, Walker -- then Milwaukee County executive -- said he would refuse to make a list of projects he would seek to fund with stimulus cash.

In an earlier opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker pushed some of the same themes, but said infrastructure projects ""may be worth considering"" if several criteria -- such as no local match requirement -- were met.

Those statements both came in early 2009 -- a year before the state’s application for high-speed train money was awarded.

In the context of that debate, in at least one spot -- the interview with Gousha -- Walker talked about the possibility of using the rejected money for the Milwaukee-to-Chicago line.

So, while Walker took a stance broadly against the stimulus program -- and scored some political points for doing so -- he also left himself some wiggle room, specifically when it came to the $810 million high-speed rail grant that started this whole debate.

That may be shrewd politics.

But that doesn’t make it inconsistent.

Indeed, he had not ruled out any use of stimulus money and was on the record as supporting using it for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee link before the new application was announced.

Teacher group claims 'paycheck protection' bills strip away teacher rights
","
Bills that would prohibit government unions from collecting dues through automated payroll deductions and require unions to get authorizations from members to use their dues for political purposes has produced dueling ads from the Florida Chamber of Commerce -- which supports the idea -- and the Florida Education Association -- which opposes it.

In a previous item, we looked at the chamber's ad and rated a claim False that unions ""take away"" union members' money, noting that union membership in Florida is voluntary and that the chamber ad uses misleading imagery.

Now, we're looking at the teachers union response.

On April 6, 2011, the union launched an ad featuring Leon County elementary school teacher Jamie Bellamy. The ad opens with a clip from the chamber's ad, then shows Bellamy standing in a classroom. Here's what she says.

""Don't be fooled, this ad doesn't support teachers.

""The special interests behind it are playing politics with my paycheck. Politicians and their corporate lobbyists are trying to take away my right to spend my paycheck how I want.

""They shouldn't be telling any of us how to spend our money nor deny anyone the right to be heard. That's what this issue's really about. Politicians denying teachers the same rights as everyone else.""

In this fact-check, we wanted to focus on the FEA's claim that the bills -- SB 830 and its House companion HB 1021 -- take away teachers' rights to spend their paycheck how they want.

As in other items on this subject, we think some explanation of the proposal is warranted since the ad offers little.

Supporters of the legislation call the idea ""paycheck protection,"" and say it gives individual union members more power over how their dues money is spent. The law would do two basic things. First, it would prohibit public unions from utilizing payroll deductions, and second, it would require unions to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. The bills essentially would allow workers to be members of the union but opt out of the political arm of the organization. Opponents argue that the House and Senate bills are akin to union busting because it will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues.

Opponents also say the bills single out unions when more than 360 organizations currently are authorized by the state to deduct money from workers' paychecks. (That's what Bellamy is trying to get at in the last line of the ad).

The bill passed the House 73-40 on March 25, and is pending in the Senate.

The question in this fact check, again, is does the legislation take away teachers' rights -- and the rights of other government union members -- to spend their paycheck how they want?

The answer is no.

The bills only eliminates a method by which union members can spend the money in their paycheck -- automated payroll deduction.

Payroll deduction is common for workers. Employees have money taken out of their paychecks to pay for all kinds of things. Some deductions are voluntary: student loans, charitable donations, health insurance, life insurance, union dues. Some deductions are not: taxes, alimony and other court-ordered actions. The state of Florida currently has 364 groups or agencies that have the ability to take money directly from employees' paychecks. Here's the entire list provided to PolitiFact Florida by the state Chief Financial Officer's Office.

The bills would remove unions from that list, but it would not prevent them from collecting dues, or from members directing money to the union if they chose.

The legislation also does not prohibit union members from using their union fees for political activities.

Without the ability to use payroll deductions, unions would have to find another way to collect union dues -- possibly through an automated deduction set-up between the union and members' individual banks, or maybe through members writing checks.

""We sought to point out that the legislation in question seeks to stop unions -- and only unions – from using payroll deduction,"" said FEA spokesman Mark Pudlow. ""Florida is a right-to-work state and members choose to join a union and pay dues of their own free will. No one forces them to do so. The same can be said of all of the other goods and services that teachers and other government employees may purchase through payroll deduction.""

""What Jamie Bellamy says in the ad reflects these ideas. Her choice, and the choice of every other public-sector employee in the state, to use payroll deduction as an easy and convenient way to pay their union dues would be taken away if this legislation passes. She would still have the choice to use payroll deduction for dozens of other services – just not to belong to a professional organization that speaks on behalf of her profession.""

But Bellamy said something different in the ad.

SB 830 and HB 1021 likely will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues, and more burdensome for workers to contribute to their union. But the bills do not stop union members from doing it. The FEA's ad said ""politicians and their corporate lobbyists are trying to take away my right to spend my paycheck how I want."" But the bills passed by the House and under consideration in the Senate only would change the method, not take away the right all together.

"['Unions', 'Florida', 'Florida Chamber of Commerce']","
Chamber takes up 'paycheck protection' proposal in campaign-style ad
","
The Florida Chamber of Commerce says it is coming to the defense of teachers, police officers and firefighters with a new ad supporting legislation that would prohibit government unions from collecting dues through automated payroll deductions.

The problem is, no teachers, police officers or firefighters are publicly saying thanks.

Quite the opposite, actually.

At a press conference outside the Florida House of Representatives on April 5, 2011, firefighters, cops and teachers accused the business group of misleading people by suggesting these groups supported the proposal, HB 1021. The measure passed the House 73-40 on March 25 and its companion, SB 830, is currently being considered in the Senate.

""I find it unconscionable that the people who are attacking the law enforcement officers in this state are now using us to try and further their political agenda,"" said Mark Hussey, an Orange County deputy sheriff.

You can watch the ad that has Hussey and others angry by clicking here, or by pushing play on the video on the right side of this screen. Here's the text:

""These public servants dedicate their lives to helping others. Firefighters, police officers, teachers are facing uncertain times. So the last thing they deserve is for unions to take away their hard-earned money to play politics, sometimes without asking for approval.

""That's why the U.S. Supreme Court voted to allow workers paycheck protection. After all they do to help us, isn't it time we helped them? Paycheck protection. It's only fair.""

The ad includes stock images of firefighters, cops and teachers (including video of a teacher also used in an ad in Wisconsin) and suggests that they are struggling to make ends meet. In one scene, a man is hunched over a kitchen table with his head in his hands as a woman and a baby look on.

That got us thinking about this phrase that unions ""take away"" public servants' money to play politics. In a separate item, we checked a response to this ad from the Florida Education Association.

First, just a little more about the legislative proposal, since the ad does little to actually explain what it's talking about.

Supporters call the idea ""paycheck protection,"" and say House and Senate proposals give individual union members more power over how their dues money is spent. The change in law would do two basic things. First, public unions would be prohibited from utilizing payroll deductions, and second, unions would be required to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. Essentially, workers would be able to be members of the union but opt out of the political arm of the organization. Opponents argue that the House and Senate bills are akin to union busting because they make it more difficult for unions to collect dues. They say the bills also single out unions when more than 360 organizations currently are authorized to deduct money from workers' paychecks by the state.

The House sponsor, Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, said that while he's not aware of any unions supporting his bill, individual union members have contacted him and thanked him. (The St. Petersburg Times found no union members supporting the bill through a public records request made to Dorworth's office).

The chamber ad, along with glossing over the substance of the proposal, misses a key point that differentiates Florida from other states with government-union political battles brewing -- states like Wisconsin, Indiana, Pennsylvania. In those states, workers in certain jobs are required to join the union. In Florida, workers are under no such obligation.

That means that no one can be compelled to join a union in Florida, and as such, no one is required to pay union dues. The protections are written into the state Constitution.

SECTION 6. Right to work.—The right of persons to work shall not be denied or abridged on account of membership or non-membership in any labor union or labor organization. The right of employees, by and through a labor organization, to bargain collectively shall not be denied or abridged. Public employees shall not have the right to strike.

Why is that so important?

Watch the ad again, or read the script with our description. Through its choice of words and images, the chamber is painting a clear picture. Cops, firefighters and teachers -- struggling to make ends meet -- are having their hard-earned money taken away by unions to play politics.

But those cops, firefighters and teachers, at the least, are voluntarily deciding to have that money given to the unions. They are under no requirement to participate in the union, or contribute.

Using the chamber's logic, they pay the union dues despite being in potentially bad financial straits.

Now the only question is the last bit of the chamber ad specifying how that money is spent.

Charles Caulkins, an employer labor lawyer with Fisher and Phillips and a member of the board of directors with the Florida Chamber of Commerce, concedes that union members are not required to join the union, and thus they are not bound to contribute money. But practically speaking, workers often feel either pressure from their colleagues to join the union, or feel like they would get substandard legal representation from the union if needed.

And some unions will take a vote of local membership of how to support candidates come election time, he says. But others just take their marching orders from the national unions.

""How do they feel about dues being used for a certain political party when they might be in another one?"" Caulkins asked rhetorically. ""There must be some Republicans and independents who don't like all the money going to Democrats.""

This comes with caveats, too. Unions don't spend all union dues on political campaigns, said Doug Martin, legislative director of the American Federation of State, Municipal and County Employees in Florida. Unions have separate voluntary political action committees, where members can contribute in addition to their normal union dues.

Edie Ousley, a spokeswoman for the chamber, said the ad is factually accurate based on its wording. When PolitiFact Florida began to ask about the combination of the wording and the images, she wrote back: ""From a pure PolitiFact perspective, the ad is true.""

We don't agree. When judging visual advertisements, we consider both the words and the images. In this case, the chamber ad says -- ""firefighters, police officers, teachers are facing uncertain times. So the last thing they deserve is for unions to take away their hard-earned money to play politics, sometimes without asking for approval."" As those words are said, the chamber shows an image of a man with his head in his hands looking over paperwork as a woman and child stand nearby.

The message the ad is sending is clear: Hard-working police officers, firefighters and teachers -- facing uncertain financial times -- are having money taken from them by unions to be used for politics. The fact is union members are voluntarily contributing to unions. If they didn't want to contribute, they wouldn't have to. 
The chamber has a point that some union dues do go to political activities -- whether that's lobbying legislators in Tallahassee or campaign mailings or working with a campaign -- and individual union members can't always control how their dues money is spend. But that's no different than how most organizations operate. Whether it be the Public Broadcasting System, the United Way, or even the chamber, people donate or contribute money to be pooled with other donations so that the organizations or candidates can spread a message. If the contributor doesn't like that message, they stop giving. 
Union membership -- and as a result, the contributions that members make -- is voluntary. No group takes money away from union members. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C469080>],/factchecks/2011/apr/13/florida-chamber-commerce/chamber-takes-paycheck-protection-proposal-campaig/
"['Georgia', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Paul Broun']","
U.S. Rep. Broun said weekly debt grows by $60 billion
","
The political carnival otherwise known as the federal budget debate was chock-full of partisan fun and games.

For instance, congressional leaders played chicken for weeks over the amount of cuts. Republicans wanted about $61 billion, while Democrats hoped for $33 billion. They reached a deal for roughly $39 billion in cuts late Friday night, about an hour before a federal shutdown.

They also played the blame game. Democrats and Republicans spent the days before the shutdown trying to convince the public that whatever happened, it was the other party’s fault.

In an April 1 speech before Congress, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun played pin the blame on the donkey.

""It’s pitiful that the Democrats have wasted so much time stalling over these minimal cuts in their own self-interest while our country is financially bleeding to death,"" the Athens Republican said.

""We should be focused on trying to revive our economy rather than bickering about $61 billion dollars when we already borrow almost $60 billion per week.""  

The federal government borrows $60 billion per week? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look.

Broun was one of four members of the 13-member Georgia congressional delegation who rejected Friday’s budget compromise. Republican Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger and Democratic Reps. John Lewis of Atlanta and Hank Johnson of Lithonia joined him.

Republican dissenters thought the cuts didn’t go far enough. Democrats thought they were too deep. Neither camp had much impact. The House voted 348-70 to accept the deal.

More information about Broun’s spending figures were close at hand. A pair of deficit hawks, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., barnstormed Atlanta on Monday to explain why Congress needs to cut the deficit soon.

PolitiFact Georgia marked the occasion by fact checking an op-ed they co-wrote that claimed ""An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt"" every day. We rated the claim Mostly True.

This is what we determined:

There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion of the $14.25 trillion debt is held by the public. The rest is money the government loans to itself. Both measures of the federal debt are valid. 
Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt had risen by an average of slightly more than $4 billion a day. This year, the debt has risen by about $2.6 billion a day. 
The total debt’s average daily increase for that same time period was about $4.3 billion. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day.

These figures show Broun’s claim that the government borrows ""$60 billion"" each week misses the mark.

The debt held by the public grew on average about $28 billion per week between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011. The total debt grew by about $30.1 billion.

This year, the weekly growth has declined to $17.15 billion or $21 billion, depending on which debt measure you use. Neither comes close to $60 billion.

We asked Broun’s office about the discrepancy. Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti said he must have misspoke. Broun meant to say that the federal government borrows nearly $60 billion every two weeks.

Since Broun got his numbers wrong, we rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C091C80>],/factchecks/2011/apr/13/paul-broun/us-rep-broun-said-weekly-debt-grows-60-billion/
