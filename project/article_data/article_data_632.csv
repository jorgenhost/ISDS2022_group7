No evidence that Chinese officials will say coronavirus was leaked from a lab
","A website with ties to Steve Bannon and a Chinese billionaire is claiming to have a scoop on the source of the coronavirus. In an article published Jan. 25, G News wrote that Chinese Communist Party officials would soon ""admit that the real source of the coronavirus is from ‘a lab in Wuhan (China)’ linked to its covert biological weapon programs."" ""A reliable source told Miles Guo today that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will admit to the public of an ‘accidental’ leak of lab-created virus from a P4 lab in Wuhan to put blames on ‘human errors,’"" the article reads. ""But the official announcement is still being finalized."" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared thousands of times. (Screenshot from G News) The coronavirus, which originated in the central China city of Wuhan, has infected more than 2,700 people worldwide, according to a Jan. 27 World Health Organization report. China has restricted travel within the country amid a rising death toll. While we can’t know who G News has or hasn’t spoken to, we could find no evidence to support the website’s story.  Miles Guo, also known as Guo Wengui, is a Chinese billionaire and political activist. He fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party. Since then, Wengui, who is a member of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has become known for his outspoken criticism of Chinese efforts to weed out corruption. G News is the media arm of Guo Media, a company linked to Wengui. Axios reported in October that the company paid Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and former executive chairman of Breitbart News, at least $1 million for ""strategic consulting services."" Both Bannon and Wengui have their own sections on G News. We could find no other media reports that corroborate G News’ story about the source of the coronavirus. There is a lab near Wuhan that deals with dangerous pathogens — and some have linked it to China’s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the U.S. State Department has raised concerns about China’s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons. Officials are still working to determine the source of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus. Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus."" The disease appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to several Asian countries, Australia, France, Canada and the United States. Researchers believe the current outbreak pattern suggests the coronavirus may have spread from animal to human at first, and now from human to human.  G News’ story is inaccurate. We rate it False.","[('Axios, ""Exclusive: Steve Bannon’s $1 million deal linked to a Chinese billionaire,"" Oct. 29, 2019', 'https://www.axios.com/steve-bannon-contract-chinese-billionaire-guo-media-fa6bc244-6d7a-4a53-9f03-1296d4fae5aa.html'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019 Novel Coronavirus, Wuhan, China, accessed Jan. 27, 2020', 'No link'), ('G News, ""Breaking news: China will admit coronavirus coming from its P4 lab,"" Jan. 25, 2020', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html'), ('Nature, ""Inside the Chinese lab poised to study world\'s most dangerous pathogens,"" Feb. 22, 2017', 'No link'), ('The New York Times Magazine, ""The Mystery of the Exiled Billionaire Whistle-Blower,"" Jan. 10, 2018', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200127200102/https://gnews.org/89749/?fbclid=IwAR006rGHjt-ew4wVX46IiDZl6G8lC8xu9nWwiR669KobEODu3AujI0GGfJc'), ('U.S. Department of State, ""2019 Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments (Compliance Report),"" August 2019', 'No link'), ('The Washington Times, ""Virus-hit Wuhan has two laboratories linked to Chinese bio-warfare program,"" Jan. 24, 2020\xa0', 'https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487'), ('World Health Organization, ""Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Situation Report - 7,"" Jan. 27, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/jan/28/blog-posting/no-evidence-chinese-officials-will-say-coronavirus/

Claim that 10,000 have died from Wuhan coronavirus is Pants on Fire
","A claim circulating on Facebook suggests a coronavirus outbreak roughly 100 times more deadly than authorities and the news media are letting on. ""CORONAVIRUS: Reports of 10,000 DEAD in Wuhan, China,"" reads a Jan. 24 story from the Geller Report. The website is run by Pamela Geller, an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, a far-right group. This is just one of many false statements circulating on social media at what appears to be a break-neck pace – far faster than the spread of the health threat itself. This latest post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, the Geller Report article is questionably sourced. It says that a guy named Bill Holter heard from a friend named Robert who heard from an American friend who heard from a Chinese friend who has relatives in Wuhan that ""there may already be ~10,000 dead there from the virus."" But here’s what we know from credible sources about the Wuhan coronavirus: According to a Jan. 26 report from the World Health Organization, more than 2,000 people have contracted the virus, the vast majority of whom live in China. More than 100 people in the United States are being evaluated for possible infection. According to the New York Times, 81 people have died, all of them in China. The figure of 81 deaths was also reported by CBS News and other media. As of 7 p.m. Eastern on Jan. 27, the figure reported by Johns Hopkins University, which is mapping the virus, was 82 However, as we were putting this fact-check together, Agence France-Presse, in a report carried by CBS, said the death toll, according to Chinese authorities, had reached 106.  The South China Morning Post also reported the 106 figure and attributed it to Chinese authorities.  So, while the death toll appears to be climbing, the Geller Report story is way, way off. A claim circulating on Facebook says: ""CORONAVIRUS: Reports of 10,000 DEAD in Wuhan, China."" There is nothing but mostly anonymous hearsay to back it up. Credible news and university reports put the death toll at a tiny fraction of what is claimed — 106 as of the evening of Jan. 27.

Trump lawyer Sekulow says Trump’s hold on Ukraine aid is like Obama with Egypt in 2013. He’s wrong.
","President Donald Trump’s defenders in his impeachment trial say the hold he put on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine was not unusual. Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow said on the Senate floor that President Barack Obama did the same sort of thing. ""The Obama administration withheld $585 million of promised aid to Egypt in 2013,"" Sekulow said Jan. 21, ""but the administration's public message was that the money was not officially on hold as technically it was not due until Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. ""So they didn't have to disclose the halt to anyone. Sounds like this may be a practice of a number of administrations."" This comparison has become a popular talking point among the president’s supporters. Trump tweeted on this, as did Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who tweeted a list of countries where the Obama White House withheld aid, including Pakistan, Honduras, Mexico, as well as Egypt.  But Sekulow’s comparison with Egypt is off the mark in several ways. While past administrations have delayed aid, the circumstances and the nuts-and-bolts process, including keeping Congress in the loop, bear no similarities to the Ukraine affair. In particular, with Ukraine, Congress had pushed to send the aid. With Egypt, they were pushing to have it held back. In the summer of 2019, Trump put a hold on aid designed to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression. As part of that aid, the Pentagon had signed off on $250 million for weapons including Javelin anti-tank missiles, the last step before the money would be released. It was after that sign-off that the Trump administration put a hold on aid. In early July 2013, Egypt’s military overthrew a democratically elected government led by the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamic group.The military arrested Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and held him in an undisclosed location. Security forces rounded up Musllim Brotherhood leaders, imposed press restrictions and suspended the constitution. In mid August, the military fired on demonstrators in Cairo. Nationwide, about 1,000 people died. At the time, Egypt was due $585 million through the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program.  U.S. law requires that when there’s a coup, aid has to stop. So the Obama administration was caught between wanting to retain ties to a key regional partner and following the law.  The hold on Ukraine aid was a closely held decision that many members of the Trump administration were unaware of until weeks after it was made. When they learned, the departments of Defense and State and the National Security Council pressed for the release of the aid. The hold was in place by July 3, but the public didn’t know until Aug. 28 when Politico broke the story. For Egypt in 2013, top Democrats and Republicans in Congress were publicly calling for the suspension of aid. Amy Austin Holmes, author of the book ""Coups and Revolutions"" about the cataclysm in Egypt, was in Cairo at the time and followed the debate closely. ""Two senators, (Sen. John) McCain and (Sen. Lindsey) Graham, R-S.C., visited Egypt. It was very public,"" said Holmes, an associate professor at the American University in Cairo. ""They were saying this is a coup and there should be consequences for that."" Congress wasn’t in the loop on the state of Ukraine aid. It isn’t precisely clear when Ukraine learned that its aid was on hold, but it was at least several weeks to a month after the decision was made. The situation with Egypt was hardly straight forward, but some moves were transparent. At the end of July 2013, the Obama administration told Egypt it had halted delivery of four F-16 fighter jets. Around late July 2013, the Obama administration started talking to key congressional committees about aid to Egypt. ""There was nothing secret about this,"" said Andrew Miller who was the Egypt analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department at the time. ""The appropriators knew that we were looking at it all –– weapons that had been purchased but not delivered and the rest of the money."" In August, Obama publicly announced that U.S.-Egyptian relations were under review. Obama did not spell out how that review would affect the $585 million in military aid slated for Egypt. Broadly, between July and early October, it aimed to avoid making a decision. ""The Obama administration was on the fence,"" Holmes said. ""They knew this was a coup but decided not to call it a coup, because of the legal implications."" When it became public in mid August that the aid was on the line, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""It would be inaccurate to say that a policy decision has been made with respect to the remaining assistance funding."" That said, in effect, aid was on hold pending the White House policy review. In October 2013, the administration announced that it was holding up four large-scale weapons systems for Egypt, including 125 M1-A1 battle tank kits, 20 F-16 fighter jets, 20 Harpoon cruise missiles, and 10 Apache attack helicopters. (By 2015, Egypt got it all.) Less publicly, at the end of September, the State Department moved the $585 million into an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where it would sit until the the administration signed off on each payment from that account. The money would still go to American arms makers to send weapons to Egypt, but Egypt had no direct access. Sekulow said both the Ukrainian and Egyptian aid faced the same deadline. They didn’t. For Ukraine, the appropriation of $250 million had a hard expiration date of Sept. 30, 2019.  For Egypt, the administration had the work-around of that Federal Reserve bank account in Egypt’s name. Psaki told reporters in 2013 that this sort of money was ""expended on a rolling basis, so this isn’t a FY2013 issue."" Sekulow said that the hold on Ukraine aid in 2019 was substantially the same as the hold on Egyptian aid in 2013. But the differences outnumber the similarities.  With Egypt, the Obama administration kept Congress informed as it responded to a coup. With Ukraine, the Trump White House informed neither Ukraine nor Congress of its policy. With Egypt, top congressional Democrats and Republicans were calling for a halt to aid. With Ukraine, members of Congress wanted aid sent to Ukraine; so did the Pentagon, the State Department and the National Security Council.  There was a hold on aid in both cases, but beyond that, the two episodes bear little resemblance to each other.

Viral photo does show longest-living shark species, but exact age is unclear
","Is there really a shark swimming in the ocean that’s been alive since 1627? That’s what one viral Facebook post claims. The Jan. 21 post displays an image of an ancient-looking shark and claims the ""392-year-old shark"" was recently discovered in the Arctic Ocean. ""This guy was wandering the oceans back in 1627,"" the post says. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, there is a little truth here: The image is legitimate, and it does show the longest-living species of shark, but the shark’s exact age isn’t clear. Here’s how we know. We ran a reverse-image search and found that the photo appeared in online news articles in July 2017. Captions say the photo depicts a Greenland shark in the Arctic Ocean. The image is credited to Julius Nielsen, a researcher at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. The photo was taken during Nielsen’s 2016 study on the sharks. The study used radiocarbon dating to measure carbon isotopes absorbed in the eye tissue of 28 female Greenland sharks. Analysis presented a probability range that suggested the sharks were at least 272 years old, and could be as much as 512 years old, with the midpoint range being around 390 years. Shortly after the study published, articles that claimed scientists had discovered a 512-year-old shark started circulating on the internet. Nielsen addressed the rumors in an interview with Live Science and in a December 2017 post on his Instagram account: ""All of this is just the same story coming to life from August 2016 and please note that we have not found any sharks to be 600 or 500 yr old.... we have ESTIMATED (meaning that it has not been verified) that one shark was AT LEAST 272 yr old or in more detail that this shark was between 272-512 yr old with 95.5% certainty (the latter also being an unverified estimate). Take home message from the authors of the investigation was that Greenland shark longevity is measured in centuries."" The Facebook post shares an authentic image of a Greenland shark, a species scientists believe to be the longest-living vertebrate in the world. But the researcher who took the photo has said the study estimated one shark was at least 272 years old, and could have been as much 512 years old, but no specific age was verified.  The photo is real and the shark is old, but we are not sure of the age.

Websites spin unproven link between Canada, China about coronavirus outbreak
","A widely shared article on social media inaccurately claims Canada is the source of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak in China. Zero Hedge, a blog with a track record of publishing false information, said in a Jan. 26 story that the coronavirus is part of a Chinese plot to develop a bioweapon. The article was republished from a website called Great Game India. ""Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab,"" the story reads. ""Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak."" The story weaves together unrelated facts to construct a conspiracy theory. Officials are still trying to determine the exact cause of the outbreak, but there’s no evidence of it being created for use as a bioweapon. (Screenshot from Zero Hedge) The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The virus, which originated in the central China city of Wuhan, has infected more than 4,000 people worldwide, and China has restricted travel within the country amid a rising death toll. Great Game India claims that the current coronavirus outbreak can be traced to Chinese agents who infiltrated a Canadian lab to steal virus samples. But there’s no evidence for that. The story focuses on the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. In 2013, researchers there were investigating a new cluster of coronavirus infections that appeared to have originated in Saudi Arabia.  Great Game India implies that disease is the same one that’s currently affecting China. But the lab was examining the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. (There are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans.) RELATED: Fact-checking hoaxes and conspiracies about the coronavirus Great Game India goes on to claim that Chinese scientists working in the Canadian lab were ""bio-warfare agents"" and took the samples to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. One of the scientists mentioned in the Great Game India story, Xiangguo Qiu, is under investigation for a possible ""policy breach"" after she was invited to the Wuhan lab twice a year for two years. Qiu, her husband and her students from China were removed from the lab in July 2019. There are questions about what information Qiu shared with Chinese officials while visiting Wuhan, and the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory has sent viruses to China in the past for research. But there is no evidence to support the claim that Qiu stole coronavirus samples and gave them to the Wuhan lab to create biological weapons. The assertion that the origin of the coronavirus outbreak is a Chinese lab near Wuhan also lacks evidence. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world’s most dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and the SARS coronavirus. Some experts have linked the lab to China’s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the State Department has raised concerns about China’s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons. ""Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus,"" the Great Game India story reads. As of now, however, the lab’s proximity to the seafood market is a coincidence, as there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the coronavirus outbreak. RELATED: No, there is no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus The CDC and the World Health Organization are still investigating the cause of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the CDC said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the Wuhan coronavirus. Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus."" Early reports suggested that the disease appeared to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to several Asian countries, Australia, France, Canada and the United States. A Zero Hedge story claims that Chinese agents stole coronavirus samples from Canada to create a biological weapon, which has now caused an outbreak of the disease around the world. A Chinese scientist who worked in a Canadian lab studying coronaviruses is under investigation for trips she took to Wuhan.

Bloomberg highlights his efforts to connect New Yorkers to health insurance
","    Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and former three-term mayor of New York City, has sunk at least $200 million on television advertising in his bid to become the Democratic nominee for president. That’s a staggering sum relative to his Democratic rivals as he lays out his argument for why he can beat President Trump in November. A television ad that aired more than 42,000 times across the country during the first three weeks of January claims: ""Mayor Bloomberg helped lower the number of uninsured by 40 percent, covering 700,000 more New Yorkers."" Since Bloomberg emphasizes his record on health care as a reason why voters should choose him, we wondered if he is right.  Bloomberg campaign spokesman Michael Frazier sent data to back up the claim, as well as documents showing what efforts the Bloomberg administration made to encourage people without health insurance to become insured.  Bloomberg, who was mayor from 2002 to 2013, said he helped lower the number of people without health insurance by 40 percent, covering 700,000 more New Yorkers.   His campaign cited a 2003 report from the United Hospital Fund, which used data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey in March 2002. The survey showed 1.8 million New York City residents under age 65 were uninsured in 2001.  (Health policy researchers typically omit people age 65 and older from analyses of health insurance coverage, given federal programs such as Medicare available to this age group.)  In 2013, the American Community Survey, also produced by the Census Bureau, reported an estimated 1.105 million New York City residents under 65 were without health insurance, a reduction of 695,000, or 38.6 percent, between 2001 and 2013.     Health policy researchers we spoke with said that Bloomberg’s numbers are generally accurate, though they noted the Current Population Survey and American Community Survey are different data sources.  The data sets contain ""slight differences,"" but ""it is common in the field to use the two together across large gaps in time,"" said Catherine Arnst, director of public information for the United Hospital Fund, which produced the first study cited by Bloomberg.   Health policy researchers said the efforts to improve access to insurance extended beyond New York City.  Sherry Glied, a health economist who was assistant secretary for planning and evaluation in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said New York State expanded Medicaid to low-income people in October 2001, and further expansions followed that decade. In 2000, the state created a new subsidized private insurance program called Healthy NY, Glied said.   ""The Bloomberg administration definitely ‘helped’ people enroll in those plans - setting up a special office to do so,"" Glied said. Katherine Hempstead, who studies health data as a senior policy adviser with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said changes in state policy might have played a role in lowering the number of people without insurance during that time period.  The downward trend ""may reflect the fact that the state of New York expanded Medicaid in 1999 with the passage of the Health Care Reform Act,"" Hempstead said.  To support its claim, the campaign cited the ways the Bloomberg administration helped get people covered. Among them: Bloomberg signed legislation that required the city health department provide pamphlets outlining public health insurance options in daycare centers and required the centers to make them available to parents and guardians. Through a grant from the New York State Health Foundation, New York City also set up a website in 2009 to educate people without insurance about their options. This included information on how to make health insurance more affordable and a tool to help individuals determine whether combining private and public insurance would bring down their costs. The city introduced an online pre-screening tool for health insurance eligibility in 2007, and it introduced online renewals of public insurance coverage in 2010.  The Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s health care initiative, passed in 2010 but did not substantially take effect until 2014. So, it probably did not affect the number of people who gained insurance before then, Hempstead said. Bloomberg claimed that in New York City, he ""helped"" lower the number of uninsured by 40 percent, and that 700,000 people obtained health insurance during his administration. His numbers are generally correct, and he is correct to say that he ""helped."" He isn’t taking full credit, and that is wise. State programs gave greater access to health insurance, while his administration worked to raise awareness about that access. We rate Bloomberg’s statement True.     ","[('Email conversation, Michael Frazier, spokesman, Bloomberg 2020 campaign, Jan. 16, 2020.\xa0', 'https://youtu.be/HXXZJ1lO5ig?t=17'), ('YouTube, video, ""He’s Done It, He’ll Do It,"" Bloomberg 2020 campaign ad, Jan. 16, 2020.

Another video falsely claims to show footage of Kobe Bryant’s deadly helicopter crash
","Social media users are sharing videos of helicopter crashes and claiming it’s footage of the crash that killed NBA star Kobe Bryant and eight others. But they’re not.  We already debunked this video posted on YouTube. Now, a different clip calls itself ""Real Kobe Bryant helicopter crash footage Calabasas."" This post, which has been viewed more than 774,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The footage shows what looks like a yellow, white and blue helicopter slowly descending before catching on something on the ground and spinning into a ball of flames.  But, as we’ve previously reported, Bryant’s private helicopter, which he, his daughter and others were flying in when it crashed in California, was black — not yellow, white and blue.  The video posted on YouTube doesn’t look like the images of the crash scene that have been posted by credible sources.  It was also foggy when the aircraft crashed, and this helicopter is clearly visible.  The Washington Post reported the helicopter went down in a remote hillside. Fog was dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters, according to the paper. The YouTube video, meanwhile, doesn’t show fog.  Jerry Kocharian told the Los Angeles Times that he was drinking coffee outside when he heard a helicopter struggling overhead. ""It [didn’t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out, as it was so foggy,"" he said.

No evidence Kobe Bryant’s death was planned
","Former NBA player Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven other people were killed on Jan. 26 when the helicopter they were riding in crashed in Calabasas, Calif. Online, some people are claiming that the crash wasn’t an accident.  We already debunked one Facebook post that suggested Bryant was murdered.  Now, we’re looking at an Instagram post that claims Bryant’s death was planned.  ""After LeBron James passes Kobe on the all time NBA scoring list, Kobe’s personal helicopter crashes only a day later,"" the Jan. 26 post says. ""LeBron has to hit the 33,644 point mark to pass Kobe Bryant & become the NBA’s 3rd highest scorer in history. The ‘33’ is significant. The ‘6’ is significant. And I’ve been speaking on the importance of the ‘44’ ritual in pro sports for months now. To me, this looks like a ritual sacrifice in order for the LA Lakers to win their 17th championship, & for LeBron to get his 4th ring. I believe this was also a ritual sacrifice for the 49ers to win the Superbowl."" It goes on about the significance of other numbers, like Bryant’s birthday, before concluding: ""This definitely makes me believe that his untimely death has been planned for a while now."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  On Jan. 25, Los Angeles Laker LeBron James passed Bryant’s all-time scoring record.

Bryant tweeted his congratulations that night: ""Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother #33644."" But there’s no evidence to suggest that Bryant, a former Lakers star, was killed in a ritual sacrifice, as the Instagram post claims.  Rather, Bryant’s plane crashed in fog dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters.  National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived in California after the incident, and the agency is working with the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopter’s manufacturer and the company that made its engine to collect evidence about the crash, according to the Post.

An attack ad that claims Michigan Sen. Gary Peters supports ‘Medicare for All’ doesn’t hold up
","Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who is running for a second term as Michigan’s junior senator, is the subject of an attack ad that takes issue with his position on ""Medicare for All."" The ad claims that ""Peters supports Medicare for All, siding with radical liberals."" But Peters’ legislative record and public statements suggest otherwise. One Michigan advocate for this single-payer approach even said Peters has never been a part of their cause.  The ad aired on TV stations across the state starting Dec. 12 and was funded by Better Future Michigan. Initially, the commercial was pulled from some airways after being challenged by the Peters’ campaign for ""being objectively and unquestionably false."" Better Future Michigan updated and re-released the ad Dec. 16, saying Peters ""supported"" rather than ""endorsed"" Medicare for All, and ran it through Dec. 20.  The commercial drew our interest ― not only because of the questions it triggered about Peters’ position on health reform, but also because it highlights how the debate over Medicare for All could play out in races ranging from the presidential campaign to House and Senate contests.  A matter of ‘he said, she said’  We started out by checking with Better Future Michigan, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit group, to find out the basis for the ad. (Under IRS rules, 501 (c)(4) groups do not have to disclose their donors.)  Tori Sachs, its executive director, pointed to two videos from a 2018 town hall meeting, featuring an exchange between Peters and a voter who supports the single-payer approach to health reform. Peters responded by saying he wants to protect the Affordable Care Act from Republicans and introduce a public option in the insurance exchange.  But Peters also said: ""The path forward is where you’re going to have Medicare for All down the road. That’s probably where we’re going to go. But we’ve got to deal with the problem we have right now."" This statement, according to Sachs, is central to Better Future Michigan’s position.  ""If Peters is (or was) so staunchly against Medicare for All, why did he acknowledge that it’s the future?"" she wrote in an email. ""Someone opposed to an issue or policy would at minimum qualify such a statement, but instead, Peters’ surrounding discussion with the town hall participant shows otherwise."" (Sachs managed John James’ failed 2018 challenge to unseat Michigan’s senior Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow. James is now running against Peters.)  An April 2019 press release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee advanced a similar argument, saying Peters is ""playing both sides"" of the Medicare for All debate.   The Peters campaign pushed back.  ""This dark money group with close ties to John James is pushing objectively false claims in their attack ads in a desperate attempt to lie to Michigan voters. Senator Peters’ position has been clear and consistent that he supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act and expanding access to health insurance through common sense policies like adding a public option and letting people 50 and older buy into Medicare but does not support Medicare for All or eliminating private health insurance,"" said Dan Farough, Peters’ campaign manager, in an email.  The campaign also provided several articles in which the senator shied away from supporting Medicare for All.  In an August 2019 interview with Politico, when asked if Medicare for All proponents could win his state, Peters said they would ""have to show and be able to explain exactly how that would help folks here in Michigan,"" and ""I think people do want to have the opportunity to keep private insurance."" His position appeared consistent in other press reports, too, ranging from Michigan TV interviews to a CNN article.  Peters generally voiced his support for shoring up the Affordable Care Act, offering a public option on the insurance marketplace and lowering the eligibility age for Medicare. In 2019, he co-sponsored a bill that would allow anyone over 50 to buy into Medicare and another bill that would establish a public health plan option on the insurance exchange.  Peters has not co-sponsored Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation.  Eli Rubin, president of the advocacy group Michigan for Single Payer Healthcare, said that Peters ""definitely does not support Medicare for All,"" but that he also doesn’t like to take a position or directly answer questions about it.   ""We’ve had many encounters with him and asked him about it, and he won’t say, ‘No, out of the question,’ but he dodges the question every time,"" said Rubin. ""He turns the conversation every time to where he talks about his defense of the Affordable Care Act.""  Marianne Udow-Phillips, the director of the nonpartisan Center for Health and Research Transformation at the University of Michigan, offered another take. ""What he is trying to do is not foreclose strategies, but to essentially say that is not his area of focus on health care right now,"" she said.  ""Michigan is like the rest of the country,"" said Udow-Phillips. ""People are primarily concerned with the cost of health care and pocketbook issues. They’re worried about deductibles and copays. They’re worried about surprise bills. I don’t think on a statewide basis Medicare for All is a motivating issue or speaks to people in a broad way.""  Still, pollsters and policy experts point out that for some voters in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party support for Medicare for All can become a litmus test. Why there’s such a fuss   With the 2020 election fast approaching, there’s a sense among some Democrats in Michigan and other battleground states that supporting progressive issues like Medicare for All could translate into political baggage on the campaign trail.  ""Independents and swing voters are more negative against Medicare for All,"" said Robert Blendon of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who is an expert on public opinion of social policy.  For instance, 65% of swing voters in Michigan said a national Medicare for All plan that would eliminate private health insurance is a bad idea, according to a November 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation poll. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)  The issue can also be weaponized against Democratic candidates.   Colleen Grogan, a professor at the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration, pointed out that it is a common GOP strategy to associate Medicare for All with socialized medicine. It can also be used to play on the public’s lack of confidence in government-run social programs, she added.   ""The whole idea is that the government is such a demon in the U.S.,"" said Grogan. ""It’s easy for Republicans to demonize the government … and say, ‘You don’t want them [the government] running your health care program.’""  Another benefit of this attack method, which could be used frequently in the run-up to November, according to Blendon, is that it doesn’t require the GOP to offer a policy alternative and instead focuses on how Medicare for All would eliminate private insurance.  ""From the Republican point of view, it doesn’t require you to take a stand on what you’ll do for health care,"" he said. ""But it does allow you to say, you won’t have any choice in your health care.""  Our ruling  A TV ad by Better Future Michigan claimed that Peters ""supports Medicare for All, siding with radical liberals.""  The statement is based on two videos from a 2018 town hall meeting. Though the senator does not tell a Medicare for All supporter that he backs this approach, he agreed that it could be a ""pathway"" in the future.  But from this comment to the ad’s overall assertion is a big stretch.  Specifically, Peters is on the record as supporting efforts to protect the Affordable Care Act from Republican changes, offering a public option and lowering the eligibility age for Medicare.

","We’ve debunked many claims that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has killed political enemies.

Trump falsely claims House Democrats never asked Bolton to testify
","President Donald Trump falsely claimed that House Democrats never sought former National Security Adviser John Bolton’s testimony as part of their impeachment inquiry. ""The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify,"" Trump said in a Jan. 27 tweet. ""It is up to them, not up to the Senate!""  The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify. It is up to them, not up to the Senate! The House did ask Bolton to testify on Nov. 7. But Bolton, who left his post in September, declined to do so at the White House’s directive. The White House successfully blocked a number of officials from testifying or producing documents relevant to the House’s investigation. Bolton signaled that he would testify only if he were subpoenaed and if a court ruled that he should obey the subpoena over the White House’s instructions. Bolton’s lawyers said he would sign on to a lawsuit filed by his deputy, Charles Kupperman, who asked a court for guidance after he received a subpoena from the House and an order from the White House not to comply.  Many of the witnesses who did testify, such as Fiona Hill, the White House’s former top Russia expert, did so in defiance of the White House's orders. Ultimately, House Democrats elected not to subpoena Bolton or take the issue up in court, saying it would create unnecessary delays. Instead, they withdrew their subpoena to Kupperman and documented Trump’s efforts to block cooperation in an article of impeachment alleging obstruction of Congress. Subsequently, a federal judge dismissed Kupperman’s lawsuit, declaring it moot because the House had given up on pursuing his testimony.  Then, in a Jan. 6 statement, Bolton said he would be willing to testify if subpoenaed in the Senate trial. He said he came to the decision on his own because the lawsuit’s dismissal meant he would not get the court guidance he was seeking before the trial wraps up. Trump’s false claim that the House ""never even asked"" Bolton to testify came on the heels of a major New York Times report about the former national security adviser’s forthcoming book.  According to the report, Bolton wrote in a draft copy of his book that Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue withholding military aid from Ukraine until the country announced investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump denied the report’s account on Twitter. ""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,"" he wrote. The White House and Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication. Trump said, ""The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify."" The House asked Bolton to appear voluntarily for a deposition on Nov. 7. He did not, saying that he would only appear if he were subpoenaed and if a court ruled that he should.

Carly Fiorina says her campaign has more cash on hand than John Kasich and Chris Christie combined
","When Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was denied a spot in a debate just days before the New Hampshire primary, she took to Medium to argue her case. Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, compared herself to some other Republican candidates in the race, including Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. She wrote, ""Despite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics — and the ones that actually matter: ""In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich. ""She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0. ""Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined."" Fiorina never managed to snag a spot at the debate, but we decided to take a look at the third of Fiorina’s bullet points -- the one about about her fundraising totals. (For the record, she was right on both of the previous two bullet points. Fiorina got 3,485 votes in Iowa, or 1.9 percent, which was ahead of Kasich by 11 votes and ahead of Christie by 201 votes. That translated into one delegate each for Bush and Fiorina and none for Christie.) For fundraising data, we turned to opensecrets.org for the latest presidential fundraising data. Here’s the table, in descending order, for hard dollars raised, defined as money raised by the candidate’s own campaign committee. The most recent data available at the time of her Feb. 6 statement was through Dec. 31, 2015. (Opensecrets.org does not have data for one Republican candidate still in the race, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore.) Candidate Hard dollars raised 1. Ben Carson $54,036,610 2. Ted Cruz $47,086,857 3. Jeb Bush $31,922,100 4. Marco Rubio $29,710,092 5. Donald Trump $19,405,217 6. Carly Fiorina $11,349,057 7. John Kasich $7,582,365 8. Chris Christie $7,159,329 So Fiorina was indeed sixth on the list. That’s not saying a whole lot -- she was ahead of only two candidates, and she had barely half the amount of the fifth-place finisher. How about cash on hand, which means money raised minus money already spent? Candidate Cash on hand 1. Ted Cruz $18,734,794 2. Marco Rubio $10,398,593 3. Jeb Bush $7,589,858 4. Donald Trump $6,964,325 5. Ben Carson $6,567,647 6. Carly Fiorina $4,484,307 7. John Kasich $2,537,301 8. Chris Christie $1,126,158 Fiorina was right that she had more cash on hand than Kasich and Christie combined; they totaled $3,663,459. Here too, that’s no great shakes -- she still ranks sixth of the eight candidates in cash on hand Our ruling Fiorina said she ""is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined.""

Flores' attack on Kihuen's legislative record in 2015 largely accurate
","Nevada Democrats are champing at the bit to take on first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Cresent Hardy. Hardy represents just one of a handful of Republican-held House seats that lean Democratic, and his is widely considered one of the most ""flippable"" seats in 2016. The district includes parts of North Las Vegas and stretches across southern Nevada. Several high-profile Democrats have announced their candidacy, and attacks are already flying in one of the most-watched and well-funded congressional races in the country. Former Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, who made waves after endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president, has aggressively gone after State Sen. Ruben Kihuen, who is generally considered the frontrunner after gaining the support of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and the state’s powerful Culinary Union. At a January candidate forum in rural Pahrump, Nev, Flores portrayed Kihuen (pronounced KEY-WIN) as an ineffective lawmaker and attacked his record, including a signature bill passed in 2015 expanding low-income college scholarships. ""Frankly, he only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 that he introduced,"" she said. ""And the college bill was actually primarily sponsored by the Republican majority leader, so of course the Republican majority leader wasn’t going to let that bill fail."" We thought her claim merited fact-checking. Kihuen’s legislative record has been scrutinized since 2011, when the Las Vegas Sun pointed out he was one of two lawmakers who did not introduce a single bill in the legislative session. The Flores campaign pointed to that article, and provided a list of bills that Kihuen introduced during the 2015 legislative session as evidence of Kihuen’s ineffectiveness. (The Nevada Legislature only meets for six months every two years.) Flores’ allegation is mostly on the mark. Of the eight bills introduced by Kihuen in 2015, only one was ultimately signed into law — a bill allowing the county commissioners in Las Vegas to propose up to a $14 fee on marriage licenses to promote marriage tourism. But she misidentifies the co-sponsor of arguably Kihuen’s biggest legislative accomplishment. (Flores owned up to the mistake after the forum.) Kihuen worked closely with Republican Assistant Majority Leader Ben Kieckhefer in passing the state’s first need-based college scholarship program. The ""Silver State Opportunity Grant Program"" allocates $5 million over two years for low-income students enrolled in Nevada community colleges and universities, and more than 670 students are signed up. Kieckhefer said the bill originated from a college affordability summit hosted by the two before the legislative session, and he credited Kihuen for helping push the legislation through with minimal opposition. ""Ruben and I were partners on this bill, and I know he worked it hard on his side,"" he said. Flores’s comments also strike at a larger issue - finding the best way to measure legislative effectiveness. Kihuen’s campaign manager, Dave Chase, said because Democrats were in the minority during the session, it makes more sense to measure effectiveness by what Kihuen was able to prevent from happening. ""The real work comes in committee and on the floor, where Ruben, while in the minority, fought to kill reckless Republican bills that would have ended collective bargaining, overtime pay and rolled back key voting rights all while passing 19 bills he sponsored,"" he wrote in an email. ""Ms. Flores should ask the 700 students going to college right now thanks to Ruben's work if he was effective last session."" Kihuen served as part of the leadership team for the 10-person Democratic caucus, and Senate Democratic head Aaron Ford praised Kihuen’s work during the legislative session. As for the critical 2011 article in the Sun, Damore said he was ""hesitant"" to lend much credence to a five-year old article and recommended looking at Kihuen’s more recent legislative accomplishments. A full list is here. Six of the ten bills introduced by Kihuen during the 2013 session were eventually signed into law. UNLV political science professor David Damore said it’s difficult to measure legislative effectiveness based solely on the raw numbers of bills proposed and laws that are passed. ""Certainly factors such as majority or minority status as well as seniority play into passage, and of course not every bill that gets passed should be become law, and not all that do have an equal impact,"" he said in an email. Nevada lawmakers are also limited as to the number of bills they can propose during the session, so legislators can’t propose dozens of bills to pad their numbers. Our ruling Flores said Kihuen ""only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 he introduced"" during the 2015 legislative session. Flores is technically accurate in her criticism. But the insinuation that he was an ineffective legislator because of that ignores some important context about the realities of being in the minority party and his role in passing other legislation behind the scenes. Her claim is accurate but needs additional context. We rate the claim Mostly True.","[('Phone interview with Ben Kieckhefer, Assistant Majority Leader of the Nevada Senate, Feb. 2, 2016', 'http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/d73cfbae00724b869239ff02f87dbf6d/NV--Nevada-Congress-Fundraising'), ('Email interview, David Damore, UNLV Political Science professor, Feb. 1, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Aaron Ford, minority leader of the Nevada Senate, Feb. 1, 2016', 'http://lasvegassun.com/news/2011/aug/06/kihuens-political-star-rising-despite-few-lawmakin/'), ('Email interview, Dave Chase, Ruben Kihuen for Congress campaign manager, Feb. 1, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/08/lucy-flores/flores-attack-kihuens-legislative-record-2015-larg/

Del. John O'Bannon says Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue for profit
","Appalled by controversial videos about the extraction of fetal organs for research, Del. John O’Bannon, R-Henrico, recently asked his constituents whether Virginia should take action against Planned Parenthood. ""Considering the revelation that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit, do you support or oppose a state investigation into the Planned Parenthood chapters in Virginia?"" he asked in an 11-question survey that was mailed to constituents and remains on his website. Planned Parenthood has acknowledged that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to medical researchers and that the one in California has been getting reimbursed. Scientists have used fetal tissue since the 1930s; such experimentation was instrumental in developing the polio vaccine. Current studies are using the tissue to research maladies including AIDS, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson’s. Federal law bars organizations performing abortions from profiting from the sale of fetal tissue. The law does, however, allow them to receive ""reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue."" O’Bannon’s statement that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling parts for profit - a claim made by many abortion opponents - is noteworthy because it accuses the organization of illegal acts. So we asked O’Bannon, a neurologist, for proof. He replied in an email: ""Considering the videos revealing the activities of Planned Parenthood officials, I’m surprised you’d ask this question. ""I urge you to watch the videos, obtained by the Center for Medical Progress, in their entirety here,"" O’Bannon wrote, with a hyperlink to the group’s website.   The Center for Medical Progress is an anti-abortion group that made national headlines last summer when it released secretly recorded videos that it claimed showed Planned Parenthood officials trying to sell aborted fetus tissue for profit. The director of the center, David Daleiden, posed as a representative of a fake biotech company that was seeking to buy fetal tissue for research. He approached officials from several abortion-providing organizations, including Planned Parenthood. The footage contains graphic descriptions of abortion procedures and the methods for salvaging issue, which may be done only with the mother’s advance permission. Some of the conversations occurred over meals, and Planned Parenthood later apologized for the casual attitude displayed by one official in her discussion with Daleiden, who was undercover. One video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling Daleiden that he ""probably"" could obtain tissue for fees ranging from $30 to $100 per specimen. The exact cost, she said, could depend on how much staff time is required to extract the tissue and whether shipping costs were involved. Another video shows Daleiden and an unidentified female colleague - both undercover - meeting with Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s Medical Directors’ Council. Gatter, after much prodding, said the fee for a tissue specimen might be $50 to $75, but she wasn’t sure and would have to consult with others. ""We’re not in it for the money, and we don’t want to be in the position of being accused of selling tissues and stuff like that,"" Gatter said. ""On the other hand, there are costs involved with this."" Federal law doesn’t define in dollars and cents the ""reasonable payments"" abortion clinics may charge for their costs in extracting fetal tissue. Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, has told PolitiFact National that the $30 to $100 range cited by Planned Parenthood officials does ""not appear to be out of the ordinary, but no one knows because there is no registry or compendium of fees charged by organizations (or) institutions supplying fetal tissue."" The videos have provided new fuel for the efforts of anti-abortion groups to convince Congress and state governments to defund Planned Parenthood. They have prompted separate investigations of the organization in at least 18 states - but not Virginia - and by congressional Republicans. So far, 12 states have concluded their investigations without finding evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood, according to a Jan. 28 article by National Public Radio.. Perhaps the most significant results came from Washington, one of the two states in which a Planned Parenthood clinic supplied fetal tissue to researchers. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, issued a report in November that concluded the organization did not profit from the activity in his state. Officials in California, the other state where tissue transactions are known to have occurred, have not launched an investigation. Planned Parenthood, seeking to quell the controversy from the videos, announced in October that it no longer would accept reimbursement for fetal tissues. It also should be noted that on Jan. 24, a Texas grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing and indicted Daleiden on a felony charge of tampering with a government record by fashioning a fake California driver’s license. Sandra Merritt, another center employee who accompanied Daleiden on some of the meetings with Planned Parenthood, was indicted on the same charge. Daleiden also was indicted on a misdemeanor charge related to trying to purchase fetal tissue. Our ruling O’Bannon said ""some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit."" As evidence, he points broadly to a series of secretly recorded videos in which anti-abortion advocates - posing undercover as officials of a fake biotech firm seeking to buy fetal tissue for research - met with Planned Parenthood officials. Planned Parenthood acknowledges that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to researchers but says they comply with federal law barring a financial profit from the transactions. O’Bannon’s statement implicitly accuses Planned Parenthood of breaking the law, so there’s a burden on him to prove the organization profited from sales. He falls short by simply pointing to the videos in which Planned Parenthood officials, under prodding from the undercover activists, say tissues probably could be obtained for $30 to $100 per sample. A medical ethicist tells us those fees seem to be a ""reasonable"" reimbursement for the cost of supplying the tissue. An investigation by Washington’s attorney general cleared Planned Parenthood of charges it was profiting from the sales in that state. Investigations in 11 other states also have cleared the organization. There’s simply nothing that proves O’Bannon’s claim and much that contradicts it. So we rate his statement False.","[('Del.

Senate candidate Joe Sestak, a Democrat and former congressman, said during a recent luncheon at the Pennsylvania Press Club that Toomey visited him on the USS George Washington aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf in 2002, the carrier Sestak was commanding at the time. ""I may disagree with Pat Toomey, who voted to send me to war, visited me on the aircraft carrier,"" Sestak said, adding, ""and then came home and voted against every veterans appropriations bill."" The Toomey and Sestak campaigns have gone back and forth in email communications to supporters and reporters, criticizing and defending Toomey’s records on veterans affairs, as they spar to represent voters in Pennsylvania, a state with nearly a million veterans. So we decided to put Sestak's claim to the test: Did Toomey truly did vote against every veterans appropriations bill since 2002? Sestak campaign spokesman Jake Sternberger said in the instance of the Press Club appearance in January, the former Navy admiral was referring to Toomey’s voting record when he served in the House from 1999 to 2005, though Sestak didn’t specify that at the time. His campaign also later highlighted Toomey’s time in the Senate, noting that he voted against plans in 2011 and 2015 that would have sent additional funds to programming for veterans. When it comes to his time in the House from 1999 to 2005, Toomey did vote against every major veterans appropriations bill, but he also voted in favor of more than a dozen resolutions that kept funding the same. As a senator, Toomey’s spokesman for re-election Steve Kelly said Toomey was a ""strong supporter"" of bipartisan Veterans Affairs legislation introduced in 2014, a bill its cosponsor (and current Democratic presidential candidate) Bernie Sanders called ""the most comprehensive veterans’ health care legislation in modern history."" In 2011 and 2015, Toomey had already voted in favor of stand-alone veterans appropriations bills, but instead of being signed into law, those dollars were later rolled into ""omnibus bills,"" or plans that funded the entire federal government. Veterans appropriations make up about 6 percent of the funding in the large financing plans. Toomey, a fiscal conservative, voted against the omnibus bills in 2011 and this past December that ultimately would have sent more funds to veterans, but he said it wasn’t due to specific line items. ""I have usually voted against these giant, thousand-page, trillion-dollar omnibus spending bills because they’re such a grossly irresponsible way to fund the government,"" Toomey said recently about his vote against the bills, according to his campaign. ""They have literally many thousands of individual line items, and I know Congressman Sestak likes to pretend that I must oppose every individual line item because I voted against these grotesque omnibus bills. That’s just ridiculous."" Sternberger said it’s ""absolutely"" fair to criticize Toomey’s record on veterans affairs based on the fact that he twice voted against the omnibus bills. Records show Toomey also voted against the Veterans Jobs Corps Act in 2012 and the Veterans Health and Benefits bill in February 2014, months before the VA scandal led to the resignation of former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki. Toomey later supported bipartisan legislation aimed at improving the VA. Toomey is a member of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus and in 2014 introduced the Protect Veterans Employment and Training Services Act, which aims to provide jobs training services to veterans. The bill died at the end of the congressional session and was not enacted. Our ruling Sestak said that Toomey ""voted against every veterans appropriations bill."" Toomey did vote against major veterans appropriations bills between 2002 and 2005 while in the House. But as a senator, he repeatedly voted in favor of other bills that benefitted vets. Toomey did vote against veterans appropriations when he voted ""no"" to the omnibus bills in 2011 and 2015, but he also voted ""yes"" to stand-alone bills the same year and didn’t support the larger spending plans for reasons beyond the veterans appropriations. Sestak and his campaign mischaracterized Toomey’s record on veterans appropriations by saying Toomey voted against funding veterans programming ""every"" time. We rule the claim Mostly False.","[('Statistics, National Center For Veterans Analysis and Statistics, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Sept. 30, 2014', 'http://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp'), ('Video, USS George Washington (CVN-73) aircraft carrier with Joe Sestak in 1998, YouTube, Jan. 9, 2010.', 'No link'), ('News article, The 4th Democratic debate transcript, annotated, The Washington Post, Jan. 17, 2016.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyFzMZYNYIM'), ('Video, PA Press Club with Joe Sestak, PCN TV, Jan. 2016.', 'No link'), ('News article, In Pa., widespread drug problem colors Senate race, Real Clear Politics, Jan. 11, 2016.', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/17/the-4th-democratic-debate-transcript-annotated-who-said-what-and-what-it-meant/'), ('News article, GOP blocks veterans jobs bill with budget vote, The Hill, Sept. 19, 2012.', 'No link'), (""News article, Pa.'s 1 million vets in Senate candidates' sights, The Washington Post, Sept. 30, 2010."", 'https://pcntv.com/2016/01/25/pa-press-club-with-joe-sestak/')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/08/joe-sestak/joe-sestak-says-pat-toomey-voted-against-every-vet/

John Kasich wrongly says Ohio's credit rating, AA+, is tops
","Ohio Gov. John Kasich is using the economic turnaround in Ohio to help make his case for president. In a recent interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Kasich touted the state’s credit rating as part of his success story. ""Guess what, our credit -- up. Think about our pensions -- solid,"" Kasich said. ""What’s your credit rating?"" Hannity asked. ""It’s as high as you can get, AA+,"" Kasich responded. ""What about AAA?"" Hannity asked. ""I don’t think you can really get to AAA,"" Kasich said, Is AA+ the highest credit rating a state could receive? That sounded dubious to us, so we wanted to investigate. For this analysis, we’re focusing on the state’s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state’s ability to pay its debts.This rating, which is kind of like a person’s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Neither Kasich’s campaign nor the governor’s office responded to us by our deadline. Standard and Poor’s sent PolitiFact Ohio its entire history of U.S. state ratings. The history shows when Ohio was first rated, in 1984, it earned AA, and it held there until upgrading to AA+ in 1996. S&P has an additional, forward-looking catagory for ratings which include ""negative,"" ""stable,"" and positive,"" and while Ohio has cycled through ""stable"" to ""negative"" twice in recent history (the outlook was ""negative"" in 2002 and again in 2009), the AA+ rating has remained unchanged for 20 years. Critical to Kasich’s claim, S&P indeed has a AAA credit rating. And several states have the highest mark. Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming -- are all rated AAA, according to S&P. Three of those states -- Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia -- have held their perfect scores for 50 years or more. For the record, Moody’s and Fitch also issues AAA ratings. Don Chance, a professor of finance at Louisiana State University, said it’s impressive for a state government to maintain a positive credit rating in difficult economic times. But, on the merits of the claim, Kasich is clearly mistaken. ""I think he probably got caught up in the moment, caught up reeling off the bullet points,"" Chance said, noting that Kasich previously worked at Lehman Brothers. Our ruling Kasich said on Fox News that his state of Ohio earned the highest possible credit rating, at AA+. When host Hannity asked about a AAA rating, Kasich said, ""I don’t think you can really get to AAA."" In fact, you can, and 15 other states currently hold a AAA credit rating, according to S&P. We rate this statement False.",[],/factchecks/2016/feb/08/john-kasich/john-kasich-wrongly-says-ohios-credit-rating-aa-to/

Jill Vogel says Virginia children as young as 12 are getting married
","State Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel recently surprised her colleagues while pushing for a bill to prevent underage marriages. ""People are going and getting marriage licenses who are 12 and 13, and 14 and 15 years old,"" Vogel, R-Fauquier, said during a Jan. 27 appearance before the Senate Courts of Justice Committee. We wondered if she was right. Virginia law now sets 16 as the minimum age for marriage, although exceptions are allowed in cases when a child is pregnant. Minors are required to get the consent of a parent or legal guardian before getting married. If they’re under 16, a marriage license is issued by a local circuit court clerk. Vogel co-sponsored a bill that would set the minimum marriage age at 18, unless a court has granted the minor the rights of an adult. Anyone seeking to go around the new age restriction by getting married out of state would face up to a $500 fine and up to six months in jail. She later amended the measure that lowered the allowed marriage age to 16 with no exceptions, even for pregnancy. Vogel said she was introducing the measure to stop situations in which young children are being coerced into marriage. ""We are failing children miserably in Virginia,"" she told the committee. We asked Vogel’s office for the senator’s evidence that Virginians as young as 12 are getting married. Tricia Stiles, Vogel’s legislative assistant, directed us to the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit focusing on violence against immigrant women and girls that researches underage marriage. The group, based in Falls Church, supports Vogel’s bill. Jeanne Smoot, senior counsel for the center, said the information came from a chart the group received last year from Virginia Department of Health showing the age of the youngest person married in Virginia each year from 2004 to 2013. The chart shows: • In 2004, 2006 and 2007, the youngest bride was 12. • In 2007 and 2010, the youngest groom was 12. • Throughout the 2004-13 span, there were Virginia brides and grooms ages 13, 14 and 15. We contacted the Department of Health to see if it could quantify the number of brides and grooms younger than 16. Maribeth Brewster, spokeswoman for the department, sent us some updated data on the number of marriages of children ages 12 to 14 from 2004 to 2014. We also pulled additional data on marriages of 15-year-olds from the Department of Health website. Those figures show that, during the span, there were: • four 13-year-old brides; • twenty-four 14-year-old brides; • at least 170 brides who were 15 years olds; and • grooms who ranged in aged from 14 to 16. In a follow-up email, Brewster said that preliminary figures for 2015 show the youngest bride was 14 and the youngest groom was 15. You may have noticed that the latest figures don’t show any 12-year-olds getting married during that span. Brewster told us that the earlier information the department sent to the Tahirih Justice Center about 12-year-olds was wrong. The department’s registrar, Janet Rainey, wrote to us that some incorrect birthdays for brides and grooms had been entered into a database. That said, it’s still troubling that 13-, 14- and 15-year-olds are marrying in Virginia. Smoot said, ""I think that we can’t know what all the stories are behind those statistics, but I can tell you that when you have someone, an adolescent that young, there is a greater likelihood that the parents are coercing them to get married and it is not of their own free will.""   She said Virginia is not unique in this regard; her group released a report in October citing instances of children younger than 15 being married in Texas, New Jersey and Maryland. A Department of Health chart shows than since 2010, most marriages of Virginia children younger than 16 have occurred in rural counties in the Southwest and Southside regions of the state. Vogel amended setting the the age limit at 16 with no exceptions has been passed by the Courts of Justice Committee and now is pending before the full Senate. Our ruling Vogel said that in Virginia, ""people are going and getting marriage licenses who are 12 and 13, and 14 and 15 years old."" There’s no dispute that there are children 13 to 15 who have gotten married. But the 12-year-olds are another story. Vogel relied on Department of Health information to say that 12-year-olds are getting married. That data, the department now says, is incorrect due to a database flaw. Bottom line: There are no records of 12-year-olds getting married from 2004 to 2014. We don’t fault Vogel for that glitch. Still, her statement requires a clarification. So we rate Vogel’s claim Mostly True. Editor's Note: This post has been updated to make clear that circuit court clerks are the ones that issue marriage licenses for minors under 16.","[('Sen.

Rubio attacks Cruz for role in a lawsuit defending Chinese company
","Getting tough on China has been a recurring theme among the candidates running for president in 2016 In Bow, N.H. last week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said one his GOP rivals isn’t telling the whole truth about his record standing up for American firms against the Chinese. ""Ted Cruz was counsel on record for a Chinese company that stole an invention from an American inventor in Florida,"" Rubio said. ""Here you have someone who goes around talking tough about China, but he leaves out the fact that when China stole an American inventor’s product, he stood with the Chinese."" ""That is a fact,"" Rubio said. We decided to check it out. The case The case in question involved a man named Jordan Fishman, the CEO of Alpha Mining Systems, a Florida-based specialty tire company. In 2009, he sued a Chinese tire manufacturer, Shandong Linglong Rubber Co., in U.S. District Court, in Virginia, accusing them of stealing blueprints and violating his copyright. His company was manufacturing tires in China when he said an employee conspired with Shandong Linglong, ""to steal our copyrighted blueprints and make low-quality knock-off tires,"" Fishman wrote in an Op-ed published in the Concord Monitor. Fishman won the suit and was awarded $26 million in damages in 2010, according to federal court records. But the Chinese company appealed and hired the Washington D.C. law firm Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, where Cruz was a partner. Lawyers argued the court erred in its original verdict because the Copyright Act could not be used to enforce damages against a foreign company when no violation occurred within the United States. Federal court records list R. Ted Cruz as one of the lawyers representing the Chinese firm.   The court rejected the appeal and affirmed the decision in June 2012 to award Fishman $26 million in damages. But collecting the money proved difficult. In October 2012, federal marshals seized Shandong Linglong property in an attempt to enforce the court order, according to industry news reports.   The claim We reached out to Rubio’s campaign, which provided links to several news articles about the case and Cruz’s involvement. The case gained political attention in 2012, when Cruz was running for U.S. Senate against David Dewhurst. PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim that Cruz represented a Chinese company ""found guilty of stealing blueprints from an American manufacturer."" That claim was rated Mostly True. This isn’t the first time Rubio has made such an accusation during his presidential campaign, and Cruz has defended himself calling it a ""bogus attack."" We reached out to Cruz’s campaign, which said Cruz’s involvement in the case was minimal. ""When Cruz worked for Morgan Lewis, the law firm represented a Chinese tire company, he had nothing to do with the trial,"" said Rick Tyler, Cruz’s Communications Director. ""He helped edit briefs, but did not argue the appeal."" Our ruling Marco Rubio said ""Ted Cruz defended a Chinese company that stole an invention from an American inventor."" Cruz’s firm represented a Chinese firm found liable for stealing blueprints. While other lawyers argued the appeal, Cruz’s name appears as one of the lawyers representing the Shandong Linglong Rubber Co. against an American company. Cruz and his firm were not involved with the original case, just the appeal. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly True.","[('Concord Monitor, My Turn: Ted Cruz chose money over American values, Tuesday, February 2, 2016 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0', 'http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/20850490-95/my-turn-ted-cruz-chose-money-over-american-values'), ('Email interview with Michael Zona, New Hampshire Communications Director for Marco Rubio, Feb. 6, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Rick Tyler, Communications Director for Ted Cruz, Feb. 6, 2106', 'http://www.rubbernews.com/article/20121031/NEWS/310319995/authorities-seize-shandong-linglong-tyre-booth-at-sema'), ('Rubber and Plastic News, Authorities seize Shandong Linglong Tyre booth at SEMA, October 31, 2012', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Texas, David Dewhurst says Ted Cruz represents a Chinese company found guilty of stealing U.S. blueprints, April 19, 2012', 'https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/apr/19/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-ted-cruz-represents-chinese-co/'), ('Dallas Morning News, Rubio: Cruz, who once defended Chinese company, can’t be ""tough on China,"" Jan. 25, 2016', 'No link'), ('Houston Chronicle, Fact-checking the Senate ads, April 23, 2012', 'http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2016/01/rubio-cruz-who-once-defended-chinese-company-cant-be-tough-on-china.html/'), ('Texas Tribune, Ted Cruz and China: What Are the Facts?, June 22, 2012', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/07/marco-rubio/rubio-attacks-cruz-role-lawsuit-defending-chinese-/

In foreign policy spat, Bernie Sanders suggests Madeleine Albright supported Iraq invasion
","Bernie Sanders is feuding with a female former secretary of state over foreign policy, but her name isn’t Hillary Clinton. On NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd played Sanders a clip of Madeleine Albright, who supports Clinton and served as President Bill Clinton’s top diplomat, expressing concern over Sanders’ lack of foreign policy knowledge and interest. Sanders dismissed Albright’s suggestion and, in turn, questioned her judgment. ""Now, I don’t really know this. Maybe the answer is different. Tell me what Madeleine Albright’s position was on the War in Iraq,"" Sanders asked. ""I don’t know,"" Todd admitted. ""I wouldn’t be surprised if she supported that war,"" Sanders said. ""The issue here is not just experience. The issue here is judgment."" Surprise! The answer is different, and complicated. Sanders may have couched his comments, but his suggestion that Albright was a war hawk is clear, and inaccurate. Albright’s position was more nuanced. Neither a hawk nor a dove An Albright spokeswoman referred us to an op-ed column Albright penned in the New York Times on Sept. 13, 2002 — about six months before the start of the war on March 20, 2003 — urging President George W. Bush to focus on destroying al-Qaida rather than invading Iraq. ""It makes little sense now to focus the world's attention and our own military, intelligence, diplomatic and financial resources on a plan to invade Iraq instead of on al-Qaeda's ongoing plans to murder innocent people. We cannot fight a second monumental struggle without detracting from the first one,"" Albright wrote. The Sanders camp, meanwhile, forwarded us an interview Albright did with the Globalist in September 2003 — months after the invasion — that seems to suggest her support for the war. When asked if she agrees with the premise of the war, Albright said, ""I personally felt the war was justified on the basis of Saddam’s decade-long refusal to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on WMD (weapons of mass destruction)."" Wait a second, did Albright change her position and jump on the war wagon? Searching transcript and news interviews in between those two comments, we found that Albright has said she would support the troops if it came to that, but she continuously questioned the Bush administration's’ eagerness to invade Iraq. Here’s a sampling of comments she made: • Aug. 22, 2002, PBS Newshour: ""(Iraq) is not a direct threat to the United States, which is why, I think, we need to have a discussion about whether we will be or would be better off with an attack or a pre-emptive attack on Iraq from where we are now, where, in fact, I believe that Iraq and Saddam Hussein are contained pretty well within this sanctions box."" • Sept. 13, 2002, NBC’s Today: ""I think that there would be a great diversion from our need to fight terrorism if we now all of a sudden redeploy a lot of our intelligence capabilities and capacities and forces to deal with a war in Iraq. … I think if we are going to go into a full-scale war, it should be possible to provide more, in terms of ways that they can see things."" • Sept. 26, 2002, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing:  ""I also hope it will not be necessary to use the authority in question. America must respond firmly to Saddam Hussein and it may be necessary to wage war to remove him. But I do not share the irrational exuberance for this conflict that is present among some pundits and perhaps even a few administration officials."" • Dec. 5, 2002, ABC’s Good Morning America: Regarding whether it is the right moment to move toward war, she said, ""The timing of this is something that troubles me. And I think we need to know more about what all this is about. You know, a lot of people who have been asking questions or accused of being unpatriotic. My sense is is that it's our patriotic duty as citizens to ask the questions."" • Jan. 29, 2003, NBC’s Today: ""I think (President Bush) yes, yet again really presented a case against Saddam. I mean, we've heard all that. But I don't (think) that it was convincing enough for me as to why (war) has to happen instantly.""   • Feb. 9, 2003, NBC’s Meet the Press: ""I think we're going to war, and so I will support the president and I will support our troops in Iraq. ... So I am not flat-out saying that I think this is a mistake.  What I'm saying, though, is that we cannot avoid thinking about al-Qaida and the fight on terrorism and North Korea. And in the last few days, there are some additional problems between India and Pakistan, and we have a lot of issues on the table."" • March 17, 2003, PBS Newshour: ""My sense now is we are doing it in the worst way. Not in fact that there is any reason to defend Saddam Hussein — I agree completely and have for a long time with the why of what President Bush has said. But the timing of it, kind of an elective war, pre-emptive action, a serious attack on the United Nations, generally questions about where the institutional structure of the post World War II world is coming to, are all questions that I think need to be considered — and that are issues that show the inevitable, the avoidable consequences, inevitable consequences that will come from this. ... And let me say that as soon as we go to war, I think all of us that have had arguments against this will make very clear that we support our troops."" After the war began, Albright remained a critic. • March 20, 2003, CNN American Morning: ""My reactions are that it is actually a very sad day that we have had to go in this direction.  Obviously, we are all very supportive of our troops who, in watching what has been going on, are quite brilliant. ... And I just think that this is a difficult war. The president has already warned us that it's going to be longer than people think. I hope very much that that part of it can get over as quickly as possible and that we are able to move into the reconstruction phase."" • Sept. 21, 2003, NBC’s Meet the Press: ""I understood the why of the war ... But I always said that I didn’t know why now. ... And then, I think the part that is very hard to deal with, is the administration keeps changing the rationale for why the war, which is very confusing and does lead people to wonder why we did it at the time that we did.""   • Oct. 21, 2003, The Herald Sun op-ed column: ""The Iraq war was a war of choice. When I was Secretary of State I said many of the same things about Saddam Hussein that President Bush has said. But I never thought he constituted a level of threat that required immediate action."" To be fair, it’s not entirely unreasonable for Sanders to have assumed Albright supported the war, given her record as a staunch critic of Saddam Hussein, said Tom Lippman, a journalist and author of Madeleine Albright And The New American Diplomacy. Unfortunately, the record doesn’t back his assumption. What’s more, Albright’s comments on the invasion — recognizing Saddam Hussein as a threat and a tyrant but not necessarily a reason for war — sound similar to what Sanders himself was saying.   ""The question, Mr. Speaker, is not whether we like Saddam Hussein or not. The question is whether he represents an imminent threat to the American people and whether a unilateral invasion of Iraq will do more harm than good,"" Sanders said on the House floor Oct. 9, 2002. Our ruling Sanders said, ""Tell me what Madeleine Albright’s position was on the War in Iraq. ... I wouldn’t be surprised if she supported that war."" While Albright has voiced support for the troops and said she understands the rationale behind the war, her comments suggest she would have rather avoided the invasion.

Hillary Clinton says Bernie Sanders doesn't have a foreign policy adviser network
","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton questioned Sen. Bernie Sanders’ foreign policy knowledge during an interview on Meet the Press. Clinton told host Chuck Todd on Feb. 7, 2016, that her Democratic rival was inexperienced with the subject. She said Sanders was markedly unprepared compared to her 2008 primary opponent, then-Sen. Barack Obama. ""There really isn’t any kind of foreign policy network that is supporting and advising Sen. Sanders,"" Clinton said. Clinton has used her years heading the State Department to her advantage, building a council of advisers to help her campaign. But we wondered if she was correct that Sanders was lacking a team of his own, and at that stage, just how unusual that is. Fleeting meetings It’s no secret Sanders’ campaign has been much more focused on the economy and domestic issues. His foreign policy credentials have become a bigger issue as his threat to Clinton’s campaign has grown. And it’s also no secret, that as a former secretary of state, Clinton has many experts to whom she can turn. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, for instance, is supporting Clinton’s campaign. Also in Clinton’s circle are former defense secretary and CIA chief Leon Panetta, and former national security adviser Tom Donilon. Sanders’ campaign did not respond to our requests, but Sanders addressed Clinton’s criticism on Meet the Press. ""I’ll tell you that we have met recently with people like Larry Korb, who actually worked in the Reagan administration,"" Sanders said. ""We talked to people like Jim Zogby, talked to the people on J Street, to get a broad perspective of the Middle East, and I’ve been meeting with a whole lot of people."" Sanders has mentioned these same sources before. He told CNN host Jake Tapper on Jan. 31 that he consulted Korb, and gave Politico a list of consultation sources that included Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute, and Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of pro-Israel group J Street. Politico reported that many of the people on Sanders’ list did not consider themselves advisers, but did say they had spoken with the Vermont senator. Ben-Ami said he briefed Sanders, but noted he met with many members of Congress and presidential candidates. Tamara Coffman Wittes, director of the Brookings Institution Center for Middle East Policy, told Politico she met with Sanders once in August 2015, but couldn’t remember any details of the discussion beyond some points about Islamic State. Korb, a former assistant defense secretary under Ronald Reagan and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told PolitiFact he met with Sanders, likely in early December. The discussion ranged from defense policy to the Middle East to climate change. Korb said they talked for a couple of hours and found Sanders to be ""insightful"" and ""knowledgeable."" Korb said he didn’t necessarily consider one meeting a qualification as being a Sanders adviser, but he had advised on subjects for other presidential campaigns, too — including for Obama, who had a much more extensive and sophisticated foreign policy group during his 2008 run. ""I’m not involved with the Sanders campaign or have an official role,"" Korb said. ""As far as being an adviser, I have provided advice to him, so …"" All of that said, it’s probably fair that Sanders doesn’t have the same established network of foreign policy experts that Clinton has, or Obama did. But Sanders has talked to experts, who have offered him advice on pressing foreign policy issues. Eliot Cohen, who advised Mitt Romney in 2012 and is a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins, said it may not matter much that Sanders lacks a roster of well-connected foreign policy experts and assistants. ""Some campaigns have in-house staffs, others have a policy person or two and a group of people that they consult more or less regularly — but not highly organized,"" Cohen said. ""This early on, I’m not sure you have to have a formal organization, as opposed to some experts to bounce things off of."" Some 2016 Republicans are in the same position. Donald Trump, who is leading the polls in New Hampshire, appears to have no organized foreign policy network of advisers. Our ruling Clinton said, ""There really isn’t any kind of foreign policy network that is supporting and advising Sen. Sanders."" It’s not a network in the same sense of Clinton’s, but Sanders has met with several foreign policy experts. It doesn’t appear he has any team with which he regularly discusses foreign policy. An expert who advised Mitt Romney said that’s not all together distressing or upsetting, giving the nature of the campaign. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.","[('Hillary Clinton, Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, Feb. 7, 2016', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/hillary-clinton-sanders-lacks-foreign-policy-network-618131523617'), ('Politico, ""Bernie\'s foreign policy deficit,"" Jan. 30, 2016', 'No link'), ('Politico, ""Sanders military adviser briefed him once,"" Jan. 31, 2016', 'http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-deficit-218431'), ('Bernie Sanders, State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Jan. 31, 2016', 'No link'), ('Interview with Josh Schwerin, Clinton spokesman, Feb. 7, 2016', 'http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/bernie-sanders-korb-military-adviser-218482'), ('Interview with Lawrence Korb, Center for American Progress senior fellow, Feb. 7, 2016', 'No link'), ('Interview with Eliot Cohen, Johns Hopkins University strategic studies professor, Feb. 7, 2016', 'http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2016/01/31/sanders-on-his-performance-in-iowa-i-think-youre-going-to-look-at-one-of-the-biggest-political-upsets-in-the-modern-history-of-our-country/')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-really-isnt-any-foreign-policy-net/

‘Advantage: R.I.’ aimed at GE, not ‘Owen’
","As she tried to bring General Electric to Rhode Island, one of Gov. Gina Raimondo’s more interesting sales pitches involved ""Owen."" A character in various General Electric television ads, Owen is a young man thrilled about the prospect of working as a programmer for the old-line industrial and financial services company looking to become a Silicon-Valley-style data giant.   Page 14 of Rhode Island’s PowerPoint presentation to GE portrays ""Bay State Owen,"" who earns a $109,000 salary, and ""Ocean State Owen,"" who makes $93,000. The governor’s Massachusetts Owen pays $2,300 per month for rent while Rhode Island Owen only pays $1,500. The headline is ""Owen in MA vs. Owen in RI"" and the sub-headline proclaims: ""Advantage: Rhode Island."" Initially, we thought Raimondo was saying Owen does better if he works in Rhode Island. We weren’t the only ones judging from the comments online.  When we did the math, we concluded it was definitely not financially advantageous for Owen to work in Rhode Island. Even after paying $800 more for rent in Massachusetts, the bespectacled software developer still earns $500 more per month, according to numbers in the brochure that Raimondo says she shared with GE. Subtracting rent, Owen would make $81,400 per year in Massachusetts versus $75,000 in Rhode Island. Raimondo’s claim became a lightning rod for some commenters posting on providencejournal.com. Taking Owen’s side, one commenter on providencejournal.com: ""This page actually shows MA being better than RI."" That wasn’t the only one. But Raimondo wasn’t making a pitch to prospective employees. She was trying to court Owen’s employer. Raimondo’s point was that GE can pay Owen $16,000 less if the company sets up its headquarters in Rhode Island. The ""Rhode Island advantage"" isn’t for Owen. It’s for GE. Raimondo’s spokeswoman, Marie Aberger, confirmed this and provided source information for the numbers on salary and rent: The numbers check out. The mean yearly wage for software programmers in Massachusetts is about $109,000 per year and about $93,000 in Rhode Island, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rent data came from Zillow. Our ruling There are lots of factors, beyond salaries and rental costs, that govern which state is best for GE or best for Owen. But when looking only at Owen’s prospective salary and rental costs, it’s clear Rhode Island is more advantageous for GE, which was the target of Raimondo’s presentation. The ruling is True. The question that can’t be answered, of course, is how much Owen might value living in Boston’s Seaport district as opposed to, say, Providence’s West End.  ","[('ProvidenceJournal.com, ""Raimondo details Rhode Island’s pitch to GE,"" Jan. 26, 2016, accessed Jan. 29, 2016.', 'http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20160126/NEWS/160129405'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('ProvidenceJournal.com, ""GE:RI made great pitch for headquarters; may bring some jobs here,"" Jan. 13, 2016, accessed Jan. 29, 2016.', 'http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20160113/NEWS/160119658'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('Rhode Island Commerce Corp., ""The RI Proposition: Opportunities and Advantages in the Ocean State,"" September 2015, accessed Jan. 29, 2016.', 'https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2698356/Raimondo-Presentation-to-GE.pdf'), ('Marie Aberger, press secretary for Gov.

Donald Trump calls U.S. 'the highest taxed country in the world'
","Donald Trump blamed high taxes for stunting job growth in the United States during a GOP primary debate in New Hampshire. When ABC moderators pressed the real estate mogul for specifics about how he would boost the economy, Trump said he wanted to cut taxes for the middle class and businesses. ""Right now we’re the highest taxed country in the world,"" Trump said on Feb. 6, 2016. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to us, but his claim could be accurate if he had been more specific. We’ve previously rated a statement that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate Mostly True, because the statutory corporate tax rate ranks as the world's highest. We should note, however, that deductions and exclusions usually lower the effective rate, placing the United States lower than other countries’ comparable levels. But Trump did not specifically say the corporate rate at the debate, so we wanted to know how high U.S. taxes stacked up to the rest of the world. Tax tables Tax experts have told us that there are usually two ways to compare different countries: Tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, and tax revenue per capita. We checked both through the Organization for Economic Cooperation, a group of 34 industrialized nations we could consider economic peers. In OECD data from 2014, the most recent year available, the United States was far from the most highly taxed among this group. Taxation accounted for 26 percent of GDP, which ranks America 27th out of 30 countries (the OECD average was more than 34 percent).The top five highest-taxed countries as a percentage of GDP were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Italy, all topping 43 percent. Korea, Chile and Mexico were the only nations ranked lower than the United States. As for tax revenue per capita, we move up a bit. America is 17th out of 29 countries by this measure on the OECD list, with taxes totaling $14,994 per person. The top five were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, which ranged from a high of almost $50,000 to to more than $23,000. Twelve nations were lower than the United States. The bottom two, Turkey and Chile, had tax revenues per capita of less than $3,000. Industrialized economies are the best yardstick, but U.S. taxation as a percentage of GDP ranks 12th from the bottom if you compare it with a larger roster of 115 countries. The World Bank’s data for 2012 — the last year for which it has complete figures — showed that the nations with lower percentages than the United States were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), a couple of oil-rich countries (Oman and Kuwait) and few impoverished states (like Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). Point being, Trump is on the wrong side of the ledger with this claim. Our ruling Trump said, ""Right now we’re the highest taxed country in the world."" We used a couple of different measurements suggested by experts to determine that no matter how you slice it, the United States is far from the most taxed nation in the world, whether it’s an advanced industrialized economy or not. We rate his statement False.  ","[('Donald Trump, comments made during ABC presidential primary debate in Manchester, N.H., Feb. 6, 2016', 'https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/'), ('PunditFact, ""Does the U.S. have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world?,"" Sept. 9, 2014', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Donald Trump says U.S. is \'most highly taxed nation in the world\',"" Aug. 28, 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-most-highly-taxed-nation-worl/'), ('Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, revenue statistics comparative tables, accessed Feb. 6, 2016', 'No link'), ('World Bank, tax revenue as a percentage of GDP, accessed Feb. 6, 2016', 'https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/07/donald-trump/trump-calls-us-highest-taxed-country-world/

Polls contradict Marco Rubio on public support for a change in status for illegal immigrants
","Marco Rubio was grilled about his 2013 immigration bill during the ABC debate in New Hampshire, specifically about why he abandoned his own legislation. Debate moderator David Muir asked Rubio, ""Gov. (Chris) Christie has said of you, as soon as you felt the heat, you turned tail and run. Gov. (Jeb) Bush has said, ‘I don't think we need people cutting and running anymore.’ Did you fight for your own legislation, senator, or did you run from it?"" Rubio replied: ""We can’t get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first, and you prove it to them."" Is that how the majority of Americans feel about changing immigration laws? Based on our previous fact-checks, we suspected public polling contradicted that position. We could not reach a Rubio spokesperson on debate night. Polls about path to legal status Rubio was a cosponsor of a bill that included a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. It included significant hurdles, including fines and a waiting period. The bill passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled in the House after leadership refused to bring it up for a vote. Since then, Rubio has called for a piecemeal approach that emphasizes border security first. Recent polls have asked people if they support a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. That would allow them to work and pay taxes, but they would not be able to vote, for example, which would require citizenship. A May 2015 poll found broad public support for path to legal status, according to a report from the Pew Research Center. The poll found that 72 percent of Americans said that undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States should be allowed to stay in the country legally, if certain requirements are met. The poll found that 42 percent said they should be able to apply for citizenship while 26 percent said they should only be able to apply for permanent residency. Pew’s survey found that 56 percent of Republicans favored a path to legal status. However, George Hawley, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, previously told PunditFact that the Pew survey also shows a complicated set of attitudes. ""A majority of Republicans also felt that giving people who came to the United States illegally a way to gain legal status is like rewarding them for doing something wrong,"" Hawley said. ""Further, 42 percent of Republicans felt legal immigration should be decreased, compared to 21 percent who think it should be increased. Also, far more Republicans view immigrants as a burden, 63 percent, than view them as an asset for the country, 27 percent."" Other 2015 polls also showed broad support for giving illegal immigrants a path to legal status. A Pew survey done in September 2015 found that ""majorities across all demographic and partisan groups favor providing legal status to undocumented immigrants. Republicans (66 percent) continue to be less likely than independents (74 percent) or Democrats (80 percent) to support a path to legal status for those in the U.S. illegally."" A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in July found a majority of adults showed support for some sort of legal status. The poll found that 47 percent of all adults supported a pathway to citizenship while 17 percent supported the right to a legal status, adding up to a total of 64 percent. The majority of Republicans too supported some sort of legal status. Among Republicans, the poll found 36 percent support a pathway that eventually allows citizenship while 17 percent favored legal status, for a total of 53 percent. Gallup found in July 2015 that 65 percent favored a path to citizenship in a poll conducted in July 2015. But this poll included larger samples of blacks and Hispanics -- Hispanics are more likely than other groups to favor a path to citizenship. Gallup found big differences between the two major parties. At 80 percent, Democrats overwhelmingly favored a path to citizenship while that dropped to 50 percent for Republicans. So currently, majorities support allowing people here illegally to change their status in some way that allows them to stay. Polls conducted at the time the bill was being debated also showed public support, though. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in May 2013 -- a month before the Senate passed the bill -- asked, ""Would you support or oppose a program giving undocumented immigrants now living in the United States the right to live here legally if they pay a fine and meet other requirements?"" About 58 percent chose ""support."" When a path to legal status was specifically connected with border security, support hit 50 percent. But 44 percent said they should not be linked. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in April 2013 asked, ""Do you think a law allowing people to apply for citizenship should take effect only after border control has been improved, or should take effect without being linked to border control efforts?"" Fifty percent chose ""after being improved,"" while 44 percent said ""without being linked"" while the remainder were unsure. One expert told us it’s not so much that the general public opposes immigration legislation, but that House members in competitive districts fear losing primary races. ""Some polls ask about other immigration policies, like building a wall, using e-verify, etc. which are generally favored, but polls have shown for a while now that there is broad support for some pathway to legalization or citizenship,"" said Stephen A. Nuño, a professor of politics and international affairs at Northern Arizona University. ""The problem is that high concentrations of Republicans in those Republican House members’ districts are feared and are closely watched by potential challengers. There is the other thing that many Republican leaders simply don't want a pathway to legalization regardless of what the country wants."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first."" Multiple polls have showed that the majority of Americans support some type of status to allow illegal immigrants to remain in the United States -- and some extend that to citizenship. We found one poll that suggested people would like to see border enforcement first, but there are many polls that show straightforward support for legal status. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('PunditFact, ""Jeb Bush and majority of Republican voters actually agree on immigration, George Will says,"" June 14, 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/14/george-will/jeb-bush-and-majority-republicans-actually-agree-i/'), ('Pew Research Center, Broad Public Support for Legal Status for Undocumented Immigrants, June 4, 2015', 'No link'), ('Pew Research Center, ""On Immigration Policy, Wider Partisan Divide Over Border Fence Than Path to Legal Status,"" Oct. 8, 2015', 'http://www.people-press.org/2015/06/04/broad-public-support-for-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/'), ('Gallup, ""In U.S., 65% Favor Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants,"" Aug. 12, 2015', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Majority of Republicans Backs a Legal Status for Immigrants — WSJ/NBC Poll,"" Aug. 3, 2015', 'http://www.people-press.org/2015/10/08/on-immigration-policy-wider-partisan-divide-over-border-fence-than-path-to-legal-status/'), ('Polling Report, Immigration, Polls between 2013-2015', 'No link'), ('Washington Post The Fix, ""Transcript of the New Hampshire GOP debate, annotated,"" Feb. 6, 2016', 'http://www.gallup.com/poll/184577/favor-path-citizenship-illegal-immigrants.aspx'), ('Interview, Stephen \xa0A.

Donald Trump overstates his early opposition to the Iraq War
","Donald Trump says he has the temperament to be president, and his position against the Iraq War proves it. ""The War in Iraq — I was the one that said, ‘Don’t go, don’t do it, you’re going to destabilize the Middle East,’ "" the Republican front runner said at the Feb. 6, 2016, New Hampshire GOP debate. Several media outlets have cast doubt on Trump’s claim that he spoke out against the Iraq War, pointing out that he didn’t appear to take any public position on the war until after the March 2003 invasion. Because Trump keeps making this kind of claim, we decided to put it on PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter. We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003, during the debate leading up to the Iraq War. We didn’t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began. Trump’s comments We only found one instance where Trump discussed the war before it started. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, ""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim: that Bush should not proceed because a war would  ""destabilize the Middle East."" The United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003. A week later, Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after party, Trump said that ""the war’s a mess,"" according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket."" Trump’s harshest criticism came more than a year into the war, in an August 2004 article in Esquire: ""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have. ""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!"" He told CNN’s Larry King in November 2004, ""I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out."" Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war in the first place. Our ruling Regarding the Iraq War, ""I was the one that said, ‘Don’t go, don’t do it, you’re going to destabilize the Middle East.’ "" Maybe Trump felt this way privately, but he made no publicly reported comments in the lead up to the Iraq War that reflect this sentiment. We could only find one example of Trump commenting on the Iraq War before the invasion, and he seemed apprehensive but not vehemently opposed to the operation. He only started publicly denouncing the war after it started. Trump makes it sound like he stood on a railroad to try to stop the Iraq War train in its tracks. In reality, by the time he got around to forcefully criticizing the war, that train had already left the station.

Ted Cruz falsely says campaign simply 'forwarded' CNN's report on Ben Carson
","Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign wrongly suggested in the moments before the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson would suspend his campaign. It wasn’t true, and Carson supporters were furious. Cruz has apologized. But he said at the Feb. 6, 2016, Republican debate that the real culprit was CNN. ""Let me tell you the facts that occurred for those who are interested in knowing,"" Cruz said. ""On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m. CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather he was ‘taking a break from campaigning.’ They reported that on television. CNN’s political anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer said it was ‘highly unusual’ and ‘highly significant.’ My political team saw CNN’s report, breaking news, and forwarded that news to our volunteers."" According to CNN, what Cruz said ""is categorically false."" We agree that Cruz's description is highly misleading. Here’s how it all unfolded on caucus night. Between 6:41 p.m. and 6:43 p.m. central time, CNN’s senior political reporter Chris Moody sent a series of tweets reporting that Carson ""won’t go to NH/SC will head home to Florida for some R&R"" but ""Carson’s campaign tells me he plans to stay in the race beyond Iowa no matter what the results are tonight."" Two minutes later, CNN’s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper report Carson’s travel plans during a live broadcast of the caucuses. Bash and Tapper both say that this is ""very unusual"" and anchor Wolf Blitzer adds that it is ""very significant news."" But CNN does not say Carson is suspending his campaign. Here’s a transcript: Tapper: ""CNN has learned some news about the man who, at least according to polls, is in fourth place here in Iowa. Now, Dana, a week from tomorrow, we’re all going to be doing this again for the New Hampshire primary. So almost every single candidate is going to be going directly from here to New Hampshire to campaign — except for the man in fourth place, who a few months ago was in first place here, Dr. Ben Carson. What have we learned?"" Bash: ""That’s right. We should say that our Chris Moody is breaking this news, that Ben Carson is going to go back to Florida to his home, regardless of how he does tonight here in Iowa. He’s going to go there for several days. And then afterwards, he’s not going to go to South Carolina. He’s not going to go to New Hampshire. He’s going to come to Washington, D.C., and he’s going to do that because the National Prayer Breakfast is on Thursday. And people who have been following Ben Carson’s career know that that’s really where he got himself on the political map, attending that prayer breakfast, and really giving it to President Obama at the time. And he became kind of a hero among conservatives, among evangelicals especially."" Tapper: ""But it’s very unusual..."" Bash: ""Very unusual."" Tapper: ""...to be announcing that you’re going to go home to rest for a few days, not going on to the next site. Plus, he’s already announced that he’s going to be coming out and speaking at 9:15 local and 10:15 Eastern, no matter whether or not we know the results, because he wants to get home and get ahead of the storm."" Bash: ""Look, if you want to be president of the United States, you don’t go home to Florida. I mean, that’s bottom line. That’s the end of the story. If you want to signal to your supporters that you want it, that you’re hungry for it, that you want them to get out and and campaign, you’ve got to be out there doing it too. And he’s not doing it. It’s very unusual."" Tapper: ""Very unusual news that CNN has just learned. CNN’s Chris Moody breaking the story. Wolf, back to you in Washington."" Blitzer: ""Very significant news indeed, guys, thanks very much."" During the discussion, CNN's lower-third graphic does say ""CAMPAIGN: CARSON TO TAKE A BREAK AFTER IOWA."" At 6:53 p.m., Carson spokesman Jason Osborne tweets that the candidate ""will be going back to Florida to get fresh clothes b4 heading back out on the campaign trail. Not standing down."" Three minutes later, according to Breitbart, the Cruz campaign sends an email telling supporters, ""The press is reporting that Dr. Ben Carson is taking time off from the campaign trail after Iowa and making a big announcement."" Here’s an image of the email via the Huffington Post:  Things get worse at approximately 7 p.m., when the caucuses opened. Cruz supporters using the campaign’s mobile app received a message informing them that Carson ""will stop campaigning after Iowa.""  At 7:07 p.m., Cruz surrogate  and Iowa Rep. Steve King retweets Moody, adding, ""#iacaucus Skipping NH & SC is the equivalent of suspending. Too bad this information won't get to all caucus goers."" An hour later, King sends another Tweet to the same effect. For what it’s worth, Cruz acknowledged earlier in the week that CNN’s reporting that night was accurate. ""CNN got it correct. Miracles happen. But that is part of the democratic process to let Iowa causers know, here is the news that is breaking. And it is relevant,"" Cruz said Feb. 3.   Our ruling Cruz said that it was CNN, not his campaign, that first reported that Carson ""taking a break from campaigning,"" and his campaign forwarded that news to his supporters. Cruz's campaign took a nugget of information from CNN and took it too far. CNN reported that Carson was ""to take a break after Iowa,"" while simultaneously noting that Carson would ultimately continue campaigning.

Sanders points to Goldman Sachs CEO as evidence of Wall Street power over Washington
","In front of a cheering audience in Keene, N.H., on Tuesday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sounded some familiar themes: reducing income inequality and increasing access to health care and education. During his speech at the Colonial Theatre in the college town, Sanders also focused on Wall Street banks, which he blamed for harming the economy. He highlighted the leadership of one firm in particular. ""Two years ago, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, who himself is a billionaire, came to Washington and said, ‘You know what, you in Congress are going to have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations,’"" Sanders said. In the context of the candidate’s stump speech, he was trying to point out how financiers were out to undercut everyday Americans. (At the Jan. 17 debate, Sanders made a different, shorter version of the statement, which was dinged by Politifact Texas.) But was his statement in Keene true? Did the leader of Goldman Sachs actually make a statement to that effect? We decided to check it out. When asked for supporting documentation, the Sanders campaign passed along a number of articles about Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein’s efforts in 2012 to push the U.S. Congress and President Obama toward a deal averting the so-called fiscal cliff. In case you’ve forgotten, the fiscal cliff was the combination of automatic tax increases -- some $500 billion -- and spending cuts scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2013. Most economists agreed that the cliff would cause a brief recession, which business leaders were keen to avoid. What was Blankfein’s role in this? According to the Washington Post, he and other executives who were part of a group called Fix the Debt held private meetings with legislators and the president on Nov. 28, 2012. ""The group’s chief executives include such corporate leaders as Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Mark Bertolini of Aetna,"" the Post wrote. So Sanders’s timing is off.  Blankfein wasn’t in Washington doing such lobbying two years ago; he was actually there more than three years ago. But what about the senator’s claim that the executive warned of the need for entitlement program cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy? FIx the Debt’s aims in 2012 were, broadly speaking, to encourage lawmakers to both restrain grown in entitlement spending and change the tax code to bring in more revenue. According to the Post, some members of the group also advocated for cutting corporate taxes and taxes on overseas profits for businesses. But Sanders didn’t talk about Fix the Debt, or about the other members of the group. He mentioned Blankfein specifically. So what was the CEO thinking in late 2012? There are no transcripts of what was said during the private meetings, but Sanders’s campaign sent along an excerpt from a Blankfein appearance on the CBS Evening News from Nov. 19, 2012. And during an interview with anchor Scott Pelley, the financier made it clear that his position was nuanced.  Overall, he said, entitlement programs including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid would need to be altered. ""The retirement age has to be changed, maybe some of the benefits have to be affected, maybe some of the inflation adjustments have to be revised,"" he said. ""But in general, entitlements have to be slowed down and contained."" Blankfein wasn’t calling for outright cuts to these programs. He was asking that their growth be slowed, something that other politicians have proposed. Even President Obama at one point offered a proposal slowing the growth of Social Security payments. That said, reasonable people can -- and do -- disagree about whether slowing the growth of a government program amounts to a cut. Meanwhile, the CEO also called for the wealthy to pay more in taxes -- a concept Sanders agrees with. BLANKFEIN: In the long run, there has to be more revenue. And, of course, the burden of that revenue will be disproportionately taken up by wealthier people. That's just logical. PELLEY: So higher taxes on wealthier people? BLANKFEIN: More taxes on wealthier people, to the extent that we need to raise more revenue, and we do need to raise some more revenue. Blankfein didn’t address corporate taxes in the interview. But in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Nov. 13, 2012, he called for businesses to work with government to lower those tax rates, noting that President Obama also supported the move. Sanders’s campaign highlighted Blankfein’s membership in the Business Roundtable group, which just last year supported a number of proposals to lower and reform business taxes. Our ruling Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told an audience in Keene that the CEO of Goldman Sachs said that Congress would ""have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations."" Goldman’s CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, did call for slowing the growth of entitlement spending, which may -- or may not -- legitimately be called a ""cut."" The CEO also supported lowering corporate taxes, though Sanders leaves out that he also said taxes would likely need to be raised on the wealthiest people to create more revenue. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.","[('""With primary less than a week away, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders turn attention to N.H.,"" Concord Monitor, Feb. 3, 2016', 'https://politics.concordmonitor.com/2016/02/politics-election/with-primary-less-than-a-week-away-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-turn-attention-to-n-h/'), ('Bernie Sanders speech, Keene, N.H., Feb. 2, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email correspondence with the Sanders campaign, Feb. 1-2, 2016', 'https://www.politifact.com/texas/article/2016/jan/19/goldman-sachs-ted-cruz-hillary-clinton/'), ('""Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton -- and Goldman Sachs?""

"['Ohio', 'Trade', 'Ted Strickland']","
Job losses under NAFTA in Ohio murky
","Ohio voters may have a sense of deja vu with some of the talking points rolled out by Ohio Senate candidate Ted Strickland. Strickland, the former Democratic governor, is again knocking opponents over job losses from the North American Free Trade Agreement. In a Facebook post about ""skewed priorities,"" Strickland attacks Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican, for embracing the agreement as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush while criticizing the auto bailout. ""With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success,’ "" the post says. ""With 160,000 auto jobs saved, Portman called the auto rescue a ‘lousy deal.’ ""  The attack about lost jobs from NAFTA sounded a lot like an attack PolitiFact Ohio checked out in the 2010 governor’s race against Republican John Kasich. Strickland’s campaign blamed NAFTA for a loss of 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China. (Kasich, of course, won the gubernatorial election and is now running for president. And Strickland’s claim rated False.) We wanted to know if NAFTA really killed a net 320,000 Ohio manufacturing jobs. NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, with the intent to smooth importing and exporting between Canada, the United States and Mexico. The deal is a big issue in Ohio, home to unions that are typically among NAFTA’s fiercest critics. Unions argue that trade deals like NAFTA send American jobs overseas. Portman indeed called NAFTA a ""proven success"" when he was the U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush in a 2006 news release. The news release didn’t say anything about lost jobs, though, so we kept digging.   Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein confirmed that they sourced their data from the Washington-based think tank Public Citizen, founded by activist and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader. The data behind their findings, accessed Aug. 11, 2015, come partly from another left-leaning think tank, the Economic Policy Institute, and the nonpartisan, federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the report, Public Citizen claims, ""Ohio has endured a net loss of more than 323,000 manufacturing jobs – one out of every three – since the 1994 NAFTA and the World Trade Organization agreements took effect."" (The group has since reduced the figure of 323,000 jobs lost to 307,000 in a revised version.) But then, the report acknowledges that only some of those lost jobs are directly tied to overseas trade. ""More than 139,000 specific Ohio jobs have been certified under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program as lost to offshoring or imports since NAFTA,"" the report says. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, part of the Department of Labor, provides federal aid to manufacturers who can prove that they lost revenue due to import policies like NAFTA. Subtracting the TAA-certified number of net jobs lost due to trade agreements -- 139,000 -- from the original figure of 323,000 jobs, leaves 184,000 jobs that were lost for reasons the report doesn’t, or can’t, explain. In fact, one of the sources cited in the Public Citizen report, the BLS, reports that in the first quarter of 2004, 10 years after NAFTA went into effect, just 4,633 of 239,361 private sector non-farm layoffs can be ""associated with movement of work outside of the country."" Economists say that other factors – say, a global economic downturn rivaling the Great Depression – also contribute to job losses. Ohio’s dip in employment was part of a nationwide trend from 2008 to 2011, when unemployment doubled from 5 to 10 percent. Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University, says that Wall Street has much more to do with the recession and associated job losses than NAFTA. Unemployment surged ""largely due to the collapse of financial markets following the failure of risky bundled mortgage investments."" Economists have also noted that shifts in employment in sectors like manufacturing or agriculture could also be attributed to technological breakthroughs that created jobs in some sectors and cost jobs in others, like when machines replace humans on the assembly line. In other words, the effects of NAFTA can’t be measured without considering all the other forces pushing and pulling the state’s economy. So noted the Congressional Research Service in its 2004 report about NAFTA 10 years out, which concludes, ""NAFTA had little or no impact on aggregate employment."" Our ruling Strickland said, ""With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success.’ "" The implication that NAFTA is solely responsible is a gross oversimplification of a very complex economic phenomenon. Just as one politician’s four-year term can’t be the sole cause of over a quarter-million lost jobs, the NAFTA trade deal isn’t wholly to blame either. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('National Association for Policy Analysis, ""Why Do Labor Unions Oppose Free Trade?""

 Adrian Garcia mischaracterizes the NRA's support of Gene Green
","The Democratic race for Texas’ 29th Congressional district is turning to a hot-button issue: gun control. Gene Green, a Democrat, has represented Texas’ 29th District, which covers the eastern portion of Greater Houston, since 1993. In that time, he has been endorsed by the gun-owner rights group National Rifle Association several times and often received an A rating from the organization -- an issue his challenger, former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia, is bringing to the fore in advance of the March 2016 Democratic primary. ""Gene Green is the NRA’s favorite Democrat in Congress,"" Garcia was quoted saying in his own Jan. 7, 2016, campaign media release. ""He’s part of the reason our president has had to use executive action to protect our people. When House Democrats reclaim a majority, the NRA will still have Gene Green in their pocket to block progressive gun safety measures. He is their insurance policy."" Garcia continued: ""It’s no wonder the congressman has a lifetime A rating from the NRA. He signed on to a letter with Texas Republicans to prevent the restriction of armor-piercing bullets. He voted against the Brady Bill, he's voted against child safety locks, and later voted for the assault weapons ban repeal. He also voted for keeping the gun show loophole."" There are a lot of specifics in Garcia’s claim, and we’ll get to those. We also wanted to check if Green has a ""lifetime A rating"" from the NRA and, although it’s harder to judge, if he could be the organization’s ""favorite Democrat."" Lifetime rating? Garcia claimed Green had a ""lifetime A rating"" from the NRA. The NRA doesn’t award lifetime ratings; it says it only evaluates candidates each election cycle. Still, candidates sometimes use the term ""lifetime rating"" to promote consistently high -- or low -- NRA marks. According to Jennifer Baker, the association’s director of public affairs, the NRA evaluates candidates by looking at voting records, public statements, plus what he or she is doing ""behind the scenes"" in committee. Baker said that if a hopeful hasn’t held office, the group primarily considers answers to survey questions. According to NRA’s website, its ratings range from A+ -- for a legislator with ""not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment""-- to F, a ""true enemy of gun owners’ rights."" Other ratings include AQ, a pro-gun candidate who has no voting record and whose rating is based on answers to survey questions, and ""?,"" meaning a candidate didn’t answer the NRA’s questionnaire, inaction the organization takes as indicative of ""indifference, if not outright hostility,"" to gun owners’ rights. Notably for this fact check, ratings for past election cycles only are available to NRA members. Baker told us by phone that when the NRA endorses a candidate, the group ""actively informs our members of our preference in that race."" A candidate who has a high rating is not guaranteed to receive an endorsement, she said, and a candidate with a lower rating can sometimes be endorsed if the NRA thinks the opponent would be especially bad on its issues. We used an NRA member password and checked with the organization on ratings prior to 2002, which are not posted online at all, to verify Green’s record over the 24 years he’s run for election and re-election to Congress. He mostly received A-level ratings, but drew one C too: 1992: rated ""A"" and endorsed 1994: rated ""C,"" not endorsed 1996: rated ""A+"" and endorsed From 1998-2010: rated ""A"" and endorsed 2012: rated ""A-,"" not endorsed 2014: rated ""A-,"" not endorsed The NRA has not released ratings for the 2016 election cycle, and does not yet have an expected date for their release. So, what happened in 1994, and after 2012? In 1994, Green voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the sweeping crime bill signed by President Bill Clinton that included firearms control measures, Green told us by phone. ""I voted for the bill as part of a package, and that’s why the NRA for a couple years didn’t appreciate it,"" he said.   Green’s campaign spokesman, Jose Borjon, pointed out that the 1994 legislation included the federal assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004. The bill, we noted, also prohibited juvenile possession of a handgun, prohibited anyone convicted of domestic abuse from buying firearms or ammunition, increased penalties for crimes involving guns and added licensing and registration requirements for firearms dealers. Green suggested that between 2010 and 2012, when his rating slipped to an A- after more than 15 years of A’s, gun legislation became an even more partisan issue, and the NRA allied itself more with the Republican Party. As that happened, Green said, he did not want to be associated with the organization. However, his grade only declined from an A to an A-. A December 2012 Washington Post article that Green mentioned to us referenced his distancing from the NRA, at the time related to the NRA’s effort to get then-Attorney General Eric Holder held in contempt of Congress after the Sandy Hook school shootings in Newtown, Conn. He joined fellow gun-friendly Democrat John Dingell, the longtime Michigan representative who retired in 2014, in criticizing the group. In the same month, Green told reporters at Hearst’s Washington bureau that instead of passing new gun legislation, Congress needed ""to find better ways to enforce current law."" Voting record In Garcia’s release, the campaign offered background on the specific votes it referred to: -- The ""letter with Texas Republicans to prevent the restriction of armor-piercing bullets,"" Garcia’s campaign said, was Green’s June 3, 2015, ""yes"" vote for the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. That act included an amendment prohibiting the use of funds to classify ammunition as armor piercing in imports. The letter itself is a March 4, 2015, letter signed by Green, Texas Republicans and others to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives opposing the agency’s proposed restrictions on armor-piercing bullets. -- Green, Garcia’s campaign said, voted in November 1993 against the Brady Bill, or the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, so named for James Brady, who was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. We checked, and Green did vote against the Brady Bill. -- Green’s vote ""against child safety locks,"" the Garcia campaign said, was his Sept. 24, 1999, ""no"" vote on a conference substitute for the Consequences for Juvenile Offenders Act. Green’s ""no"" vote was in response to a motion to instruct conferees, or a House vote to tell its conference committee members how to resolve an issue while negotiating a version of the bill between the House and the Senate. The issue at hand was a Senate amendment that required that child safety locks be sold with every handgun, among other regulations. Green voted no, to instruct committee members to reject that amendment. --Garcia’s reference to Green’s ""vote for the assault weapons ban repeal"" was Green’s March 22, 1996, ""yes"" vote for the Gun Crime Enforcement and Second Amendment Restoration Act. Green did vote for the legislation, which would have repealed the assault weapons ban that he earlier voted to put in place. --Green’s vote for ""keeping the gun show loophole"" was his June 18, 1999, ""no"" vote against the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act. Green, Garcia’s campaign said, voted against an amendment to regulate firearms transfers at gun shows and require criminal background checks to prevent the sale of guns to minors and felons. In response to these claims, Borjon, Green’s campaign spokesman, pointed out a few votes from Green’s tenure that tended toward gun control, including his 1994 vote in support of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Borjon also emphasized Green’s vote for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Acts, which included the Child Safety Lock Act. Green himself emphasized to us that he supported the bipartisan gun legislation authored by California Democrat Mike Thompson and New York Republican Peter King, the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act. When we asked about Green’s voting record and his current stance on gun legislation, Green’s campaign said he supported President Obama’s 2016 executive action on gun safety. ‘Favorite Democrat in Congress’ Garcia’s campaign release also referred to Green as the ""NRA’s favorite Democrat in Congress."" While that’s not a determination we can make, we looked at the current Democrats in Congress to see if like Green, any have garnered mostly high ratings and endorsements. Of the 232 Democrats in Congress as of early 2016, six had fielded A ratings from the NRA before their latest election. Four others, besides Green, had A- ratings. One was rated AQ. The ""A"" Democrats were: Rep. Sanford Bishop of Georgia, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Reps. Collin Peterson and Tim Walz of Minnesota, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin. Democrats besides Green with an A-: Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota was rated AQ. We reached out to Sean Theriault, a professor at the University of Texas who studies Congress. He said: ""It looks like Green is among a group of Democrats who support the Second Amendment."" Heading into the 2014 House elections, according to a ProPublica graphic Theriault sent us, 25 Democrats in Congress were rated from A- to A+. So, why did we identify only a dozen with that distinction? Many of the Democrats who drew high NRA marks in 2013 didn’t win re-election the next year.   Our ruling Adrian Garcia said that his competitor in the Democratic race for Texas’ 29th district, Rep. Gene Green, has a ""lifetime A rating"" from the NRA and is the NRA’s ""favorite Democrat in Congress."" Green has certainly been a strong supporter of gun rights over his 23 years in the House. The gun control measures Green’s campaign pointed out that he supported were part of packages like the 1994 crime bill, in which Green voted with his party. However, the votes Garcia cites seem to have been cherry-picked from Green’s long career in Congress. While Green has voted against child safety locks, as Garcia said, he also later voted for them. In recent years, Green has inched away from NRA interests, supporting bipartisan gun legislation and President Obama’s executive action on gun safety. Garcia’s claim on Green’s ""lifetime rating"" also misses Green’s 1994 sharp drop in favor with the NRA and his recent slight shift away from the organization. As for the NRA’s ""favorite Democrat,"" Green is not the only Democrat to support gun rights, or to be supported by the NRA. He’s not even the organization’s strongest Democratic supporter, based on its most recent ratings. He is part of a shrinking group of pro-gun Democrats. We rate this claim Mostly False.
