Texas has recorded COVID deaths since removing its mask mandate — thousands of them
","U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican of Colorado, invoked Gov. Greg Abbott's repeal of the state's mask mandate to illustrate how Republicans, and not Democrats, are basing COVID-19 policies on science.   During a May 19 interview on Dr. Gina Prime Time with host Gina Loudon, a conservative TV personality on the web-based network Real America’s Voice and former campaign surrogate for President Donald Trump, Boebert and Loudon blasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., over Democrats' mask rules  House rules state that, until all members and staff are fully vaccinated, masks are required on the House floor and in committee meeting rooms, with fines of $500 for the first offense and $2,500 for the second offense, Politico reported.   As of May 14, all House Democrats reported having received a COVID-19 vaccine. Ninety-five of the 212 Republican House members reported being vaccinated, with 112 Republicans not responding to a survey, according to CNN.  Boebert was one of many House Republicans who joined a maskless protest within the House chamber alongside a dozen other members, including Texas representatives Chip Roy, Beth Van Duyne and Louie Gohmert, according to Politico. Their protest argued that leaving the mask-wearing rules in place contravened the latest guidelines released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which eased face covering guidelines for vaccinated people. ""It just goes to show that this party’s ‘follow the science’ slogan is a total joke,"" Boebert said.  Then she referenced Abbott's move to lift the statewide mask rules effective March 10 as part of an effort to ""open Texas 100%.""  ""Texas removed their mask mandate two months ago, and sleepy Joe called it Neanderthal thinking,"" she said. ""No sir. Republicans are just following the science. And since removing the mask mandate two months ago, Texas has not reported a single COVID death. Not one."" A look at the state’s COVID-19 dashboard shows that, although daily fatality numbers are decreasing, more than 3,000 Texans have died of the coronavirus since the mask mandate was lifted. That’s about 6% of the 50,000 deaths Texas has recorded since the beginning of the pandemic.  This total also does not include fatalities from May 23 to date, which have not yet been recorded by the state. And totals from May 10 onward are still trickling in because, according to a Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson, it takes around 10 days, on average, for funeral homes and medical officials to submit death certificates.   About 34% of Texans, or around 9.9 million people, have been fully vaccinated, according to state data. Health officials have said that between 75% and 95% of the state population need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity.   Boebert represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which comprises the western swath of the state, home to a smattering of ski resorts, national forest, ranches and coal-mining towns, according to the Associated Press. Boebert defeated longstanding Republican Rep. Scott Tipton in 2020 after accusing Tipton of not being sufficiently pro-Trump. Her far-right views are centered around gun rights, and she owns a restaurant where servers openly carry firearms.  Her spokesperson, Ben Stout, did not respond to requests for comment.   Boebert said during a May 19 interview with Gina Loudon that, since Texas removed its mask mandate, the state ""has not reported a single COVID death. Not one.""  A quick look at the state-run COVID-19 dashboard, which tracks coronavirus cases, deaths and other metrics, shows that more than 3,000 Texans have died of COVID-19 since Abbott lifted the mandate on March 10.   We rate this claim Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0BAF80>],/factchecks/2021/may/25/lauren-boebert/texas-has-recorded-covid-deaths-removing-mask-mand/

Yes, Evers’ proposed budget would return the state’s general fund to a deficit
","Wisconsin’s state government is diving into another battle over how its budget will look for the upcoming two-year period.  In February, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, proposed a $91 billion spending plan for 2021-23, seeking to expand Medicaid, roll back Act 10-era collective bargaining limits, legalize marijuana and raise the minimum wage -- among scores of other items intended to put the state back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic.  On May 6, 2021, the Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee stripped nearly 400 items from Evers’ budget, with the co-chairs saying it included ""a tremendous amount of excessive spending, pet projects, tax increases and divisive non-fiscal policy.""  Democrats say Evers’ budget would fix long-standing problems in the state and honor measures that are widely popular with voters. But Republicans say their plan would keep Wisconsinites from facing a higher tax burden.  They’ve also argued that the governor’s budget would send the state’s general fund back into a deficit based on a common accounting standard, after its 2019-21 budget created the first positive balance by that standard that the general fund had seen since 2000.  Staff of Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, created a chart showing as much that several members of the Republican caucus have shared on social media.  Is the claim correct?  Let’s dig in.  The chart cited depicts Wisconsin’s general fund deficit dating back to 2000, at which time the deficit totaled around $1 billion based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.  The line peaks in fiscal year 2010-11, when the general fund deficit was nearly $3 billion, by this measure.  In 2020, the chart shows a negative deficit — or rather, a positive general fund balance. An arrow then indicates that Evers’ proposed 2021-23 budget would return the general fund to a deficit.  ""Gov. Evers’ budget is a ‘bounce back’ to larger GAAP deficits,"" Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, tweeted along with the chart on April 7, 2021. Adam Gibbs, communications director for the office of Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, provided an analysis from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau that bears some of the claim out.  The analysis, which Marklein requested in December 2019, indeed shows the state’s general fund had been in deficit since 2000, with the largest — $2.99 billion — during fiscal year 2010-11. It ends with fiscal year 2017-18, at a $1.25 billion deficit.  The general fund deficit for the following year is detailed in Wisconsin’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. In 2019, it was just under $800 million in deficit.  In 2020, the tide turned and the general fund reached $1.5 million under those standard accounting principles, according to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ending June 30.  At the time, Evers credited his government for working on issues important to Wisconsinites ""without running up the state’s credit card."" It was the first time Wisconsin had reached a positive GAAP fund balance since the state began issuing the comprehensive annual financial reports, he said.  Evers’ 2021-23 budget in brief, released in February 2021, outlines a return to the general fund deficit over the next two years.  In 2021, the estimated closing GAAP fund balance is still positive, at about $921 million. In 2022, it’s estimated at a deficit of nearly $2 million. In 2023, the estimated deficit is about $938 million.  This deficit doesn’t mean the state’s budget isn’t balanced — in fact, Wisconsin is required by law to pass a balanced budget where estimated revenues are at least equal to estimated expenditures.  The GAAP system, however, counts future expenditures at the time that the state commits to spending on them, even if they won’t be paid until the next budget cycle. The state’s other method of accounting, called cash modified accrual, doesn’t count expenditures until it comes time to pay them. Members of the state’s Republican caucus claim that Evers’ proposed budget would return the state to a GAAP fund deficit, after its first positive balance in the fund in decades in the biennium prior.  The Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis shows the fund’s deficit through fiscal year 2018, and the state’s annual financial report shows it turning around in 2020. In the Department of Administration’s estimation of the next two years, the deficit would return in 2022 and persist through 2023.  We rate this claim True.     ",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B8F40>],/factchecks/2021/may/25/wisconsin-republican-legislative-leaders/yes-evers-proposed-budget-would-return-states-gene/

(AP) The video is missing critical context: The Democrats present were acting in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recently updated guidance for fully vaccinated Americans, which as of May 13 said vaccinated people could gather indoors without masks and without physically distancing. The people in the video were not ""caught"" violating any mask mandate. ""Fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance in any setting, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance,"" the agency said.

CNN reported soon after that 100% of Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate had been vaccinated. The crowd at Biden’s event also included Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who co-wrote the legislation, and whom Biden thanked in his remarks.  ""The nicest part is being able to shake hands again and to see people's smiles,"" Collins said.

Fish treadmills, earthquake-proof gingerbread houses? Not so fast
","Josh Mandel, an Ohio politician who describes himself as the first statewide Ohio official to support former President Donald Trump, voiced concern over government waste. ""The federal government spent over $500k trying to force fish to exercise on treadmills, an additional $150k to see if gingerbread houses are earthquake proof, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg,"" Mandel tweeted May 21. ""Wasteful spending is robbing America’s future, it must be exposed and stopped!"" The federal government spent over $500k trying to force fish to exercise on treadmills, an additional $150k to see if gingerbread houses are earthquake proof, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.Wasteful spending is robbing America’s future, it must be exposed and stopped! Mandel’s warnings come a bit late. Former Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake listed them in his 2017 Wastebook.  The fish project, funded with $560,536 from the National Science Foundation, took place at the University of California-San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Mudskipper fish, a sort that can live and walk out of water, were put in a chamber and placed on a well-moistened treadmill. Researchers found that the fish could exercise longer when oxygen levels were higher. They took this to suggest that rising oxygen levels sped the emergence of animals on land hundreds of millions of years ago. The project lasted from 2009 to 2013. What Mandel took to be a test of earthquake readiness was actually a twist on the traditional gingerbread house at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. In 2016, for a price of $25 per house, adults spent an evening hearing architects describe how buildings are designed to withstand earthquakes. Then, participants had a chance to design, build and test their own quake-proof gingerbread house. They put their creations on a shaking platform and watched if it held up or crumbled. ""We have long considered a holiday-themed program for OMSI and this was the perfect fit, marrying food science with a beloved holiday tradition,"" said Andrea Edgecombe, the museum’s event director, in 2016. Mandel made too much of the federal contribution to the party, however. According to museum president Erin Graham, the gingerbread workshops were part of a larger effort to make use of the museum’s café outside of typical lunchtime hours.  ""The project funds spent on the workshops was only $3,432,"" Graham said. On average, the federal government sends the Oregon museum a grant in the neighborhood of $150,000 per year. The purpose is to ""strengthen the ability of an individual museum to serve the public more effectively."" The money is matched with local and state dollars. In the 2017-18 period for example, Washington’s $149,820 was matched with $164,893 from other sources. The gingerbread earthquake class proved to be popular, so the museum continued to offer it through at least 2018. We tweeted to Mandel to ask him about the lateness of his heads-up on Washington profligacy. We did not hear back, but if we do, we will add his comments to this piece. Mandel warned about wasteful spending, and cited the examples of $500,000 on a treadmill for fish and $150,000 to see if gingerbread houses are earthquake-proof. Waste is in the eye of the beholder, but Mandel failed to notice that the fish experiment was part of research into the evolution of life on land. It ended in 2013. He blamed the federal government for funding a museum class that injected a bit of fun into learning about resilient building design. But he greatly exaggerated the federal impact; Washington covered about $3,400 of the workshop, not the $150,000 he said. Mandel recycled old complaints, and mischaracterized what was funded. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096747AC0>],/factchecks/2021/may/24/josh-mandel/fish-treadmills-earthquake-proof-gingerbread-house/

Yes, large majorities support elected Chicago school board
","For the first time in Chicago’s history, voters would get a say in who runs the city’s school board under two competing proposals now before the state legislature. One calls for a fully elected board of education, and the other for a ""hybrid"" model splitting the school board into some elected members with the majority still appointed by the mayor. In an interview with The Daily Line’s ""CloutCast"" podcast, the state senator sponsoring the fully elected school board plan addressed his opponents by pointing to referendums, surveys and previous House floor votes showing overwhelming support of a fully elected board. ""The idea that there is opposition to this, it is super-minority opposition,"" said state Sen. Robert Martwick, a Chicago Democrat who has pushed for a fully elected board for years. ""It’s just a couple of loud voices."" Is the record of support for a fully elected school board as strong as Martwick described? We decided to find out. For 150 years, the Chicago Board of Education has been chosen through a political appointment process headed by the city’s mayor. That stands in contrast to over 90% of school districts nationwide, according to a 2016 Pew Charitable Trusts study. There is no consensus among researchers about which form of governance fosters better student performance or fiscal management, however, the Pew study noted. And school boards in some other major cities, such as New York, are run by appointed members too. Still, overwhelming majorities of Chicagoans have long favored a switch. The Chicago Tribune published the results of a 2011 Tribune/WGN-TV poll that found 77% supported an elected board. A 2015 Tribune poll found roughly the same level of support. And last month, Crain’s Chicago Business released the finding Martwick cited during the podcast: 79% of business executives surveyed backed his proposal for a board elected by citizens in 20 districts across the city. Chris Mooney, a state politics expert at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs, cautioned that surveys on questions like this don’t necessarily show the depth of public support for or understanding of a policy change, however. If you ask voters whether they favor an elected school board, Mooney said, the answer will be, ""‘yeah, well of course, why wouldn't we? It’s America, we have democracy.’"" Martwick said he believes democracy is what’s at stake. ""People say, ‘Oh, well this’ll fix all of our financial problems?’ Didn't say that. ‘Provide for better student outcomes?’ Didn't say that either,"" Martwick told us in a phone interview. ""It’s about the ability to choose my government and hold them accountable."" Chicago voters also have backed the chance to have that kind of say in two non-binding referendums. Ahead of both elections, then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his allies blocked the question from appearing citywide, but the Chicago Teachers Union and other supporters were able to collect enough signatures for it to appear on ballots in some parts of the city. In 2012, the elected school board question received 87% support in 327 precincts, and in 2015, 89% of voters in 37 wards backed it. The measure also received near-unanimous support in previous years when it came up for votes in the General Assembly, which would have to pass a bill changing state law in order to alter how the board is governed. In 2016, 2017 and 2019, the House voted to approve Martwick’s plan for a 21-member fully elected board, by margins of 110-4, 105-9 and 110-2, respectively. A modified version calling for fewer members and an independent commission to draw district maps also passed the Senate 53-2 in 2017, but was never taken up by then-House Speaker Michael Madigan. Asked why the bill has languished in Springfield for all these years despite its popularity, Martwick told us the short answer is ""politics."" Emanuel, he said, ""had a lot of influence over the process and he was able to stall that bill successfully in the Senate."" Opponents of an elected school board have traditionally argued a school board appointed by an elected mayor offers a good balance between efficiency and accountability. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who supported an elected school board during her campaign, opposes Martwick’s plan and has called a 21-member board ""unwieldy."" The city’s counter proposal would create a board of seven members and later grow to 11, a minority of whom would be elected by voters. State Sen. Kimberly Lightford is sponsoring that bill. The mayor would appoint five, and later eight, of the members. One version of Martwick’s plan passed the House 71-39 last month, with all Chicago-based legislators voting in favor of it. Following that vote, Senate President Don Harmon promised to put a bill creating an elected Chicago school board on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s desk this year. However, Harmon has asked the sponsors of the different proposals to first work toward a compromise that would transition the board from appointed to elected members gradually rather than immediately. Martwick said opposition to letting voters pick who sits on Chicago’s school board is in the ""super minority."" For support, he pointed to surveys, referendums and House floor votes all overwhelmingly favoring an elected board. Several older polls Martwick did not mention garnered similar results, as did a vote on a modified version of his plan in the state Senate. A recent House vote on the measure this year also gained majority approval. We rate Martwick’s claim True. TRUE — The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

No, video doesn’t prove AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contains Bluetooth chip
","A debunked claim from the early days of the pandemic — that the COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips — is spreading anew online, courtesy of a TikTok video circulating across platforms. ""AstraZeneca Bluetooth side effect,"" says the text on the two-part TikTok video, which shows a man who claims that his body has been connecting to Bluetooth-enabled devices ever since he got the AstraZeneca shot. One hashtag on the video: ""#chipped."" The ingredients for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine are publicly available online, including on government websites where the vaccine is approved for use, such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. (The vaccine has not been authorized for emergency use in the U.S.) It does not contain anything related to Bluetooth technology or microchips. PolitiFact has fact-checked several claims alleging that the vaccines contain microchips, all inaccurate. Yet, the viral TikTok video has been reposted to Instagram, YouTube and other platforms. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Conspiracy theories about microchips in the COVID-19 vaccines have been so persistent that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention addressed them in a vaccine safety FAQ. ""There may be trackers on the vaccine shipment boxes to protect them from theft, but there are no trackers in the vaccines themselves,"" the agency wrote. This two-part TikTok video adds a new wrinkle to the false narrative, with the man in the video claiming his body is connecting to Bluetooth-enabled devices as a result of the vaccine. In the first part of the video, the man sits at a counter and talks about the side effects he felt after getting his vaccine. The camera focuses on his smartphone, which then shows a notification for a ""Bluetooth pairing request"" from a device titled ""AstraZeneca_ChAdOx1-S."" ""The only problem is that everywhere I go, everywhere I go, everything is trying to connect to me now, like Bluetooth connectivity,"" the man says before showing his phone. ""I got Bluetooth connectivity. I get in the car, my car is trying to connect to me. I go home, my computer is trying to connect. My phone is trying to connect. Like everything, all the time."" In the second part of the video, the man is sitting at the same counter but wearing a different outfit. He approaches a TV, and the TV says, ""Connecting to AstraZeneca_ChAdOx1-S."" But the TikTok video doesn’t prove what it claims to.  First, Bluetooth-enabled devices can typically be renamed as the user sees fit, and any other device could be triggering the notifications in the video. Second, microchips are too big to fit into the COVID-19 shots. ""A microchip is about 0.5 inches long,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, chair of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. ""That wouldn’t fit through the end of a needle."" The video resembles other recent postings by social media users who claimed, falsely, that they were able to stick magnets to their arms because of microchips in the vaccines.  As PolitiFact and other fact-checkers reported, there’s nothing magnetic or metallic in the vaccines. ""It’s protein and lipids, salts, water and chemicals that maintain the pH,"" Thomas Hope, a vaccine researcher at Northwestern University, told AFP. ""That’s basically it. AstraZeneca did not respond to requests for comment. A TikTok video claims the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contains a Bluetooth microchip. There’s no support for that claim. The ingredients for the AstraZeneca vaccine do not include Bluetooth technology. Claims that the vaccines contain microchips have been widely debunked.  What’s more, Bluetooth enabled devices can be renamed as users see fit — and there’s no evidence the man’s body is responsible for the notifications shown in the video.

No, getting a COVID-19 vaccine won’t expose you to high amounts of electromagnetic radiation

The video starts with a woman pointing a hand-held device labeled ""electromagnetic radiation tester"" at her own arm.

The screen also switches to ""harmful,"" instead of safe. The electromagnetic radiation tester has a similar response to being pointed at a charging port, with readings over 200. Finally, the narrator turns the device to another person who indicates he received a COVID-19 vaccine at a designated spot on his arm. When she points the tester at his arm, the device begins beeping, and the red light flashes. The screen shows an ""E-field:"" between 116 and 134 — which the device classified as ""harmful."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Despite what the video implies, experts say there’s no way that a COVID-19 vaccine could contribute to the creation of an electromagnetic field that would set off an EMF detector. Dr. Gregory Poland, head of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group, said there is ""absolutely nothing in the vaccines that could do this."" Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases within the Johns Hopkins University Department of Medicine, explained that ""all things emit EMF — because EMF is any radiation and everything radiates energy unless it’s at absolute zero."" (He is referring to the temperature absolute zero, or -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit.)  With this in mind, Ray said it is possible that a human body could emit some sort of radiation — and experts confirm that all things, including human bodies, emit radiation.  ""But there is nothing at all in a vaccine that we would expect to change the amount of radiation that somebody gives off,"" Ray said.  He also specified that the COVID-19 vaccines would not impact the amount of someone’s radiation. ""There’s nothing that sets them apart in this way because the (COVID-19) vaccines use the person’s own biological machinery to generate an immune response, and that same machinery is running all the time,"" Ray said. ""The process that is triggered is a usual process that is triggered for the immune system and involves no particular radiation."" Upon watching the video, Ray said, ""You can get anything to happen on a video.""  Based on his background with physics, he said: ""I’m confident that what they’re doing is somehow misleading,"" because the COVID-19 vaccines would not cause the readings on video. PolitiFact found the electromagnetic radiation tester that appears to be used in the video. It is advertised as capable of detecting electric fields in volts per meter and magnetic fields in microteslas. In the video, the electromagnetic radiation tester is registering only small electric fields. No magnetic fields are detected. People are exposed to a variety of ""weak"" magnetic and electric fields every day because of ""the generation and transmission"" of electric appliances and telecommunications equipment, according to the World Health Organization.  The WHO says magnetic and electric fields influence the body — but only a limited amount.  ""Both electric and magnetic fields induce voltages and currents in the body but even directly beneath a high voltage transmission line, the induced currents are very small compared to thresholds for producing shock and other electrical effects,"" the WHO explains.  In addition, the organization says, ""Tiny electrical currents exist in the human body due to the chemical reactions that occur as part of the normal bodily functions, even in the absence of external electric fields.""  Overall, the WHO concludes that more than 30 years of research have not revealed evidence ""of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields."" Iowa State University summarized the issue in this fact sheet: ""Some measurable biological effects from exposure to very high levels of EMF can be detected. There is no scientific evidence that exposure to normal levels of EMFs has any health effect.""  A Facebook video attempts to show that putting an electromagnetic radiation detector near someone’s COVID-19 vaccination site shows that those who are vaccinated give off high amounts of electromagnetic radiation.  All human bodies give off some level of radiation, but experts say that the video is misleading because there is nothing in the COVID-19 vaccines that could impact the amount of radiation a person gives off.  What’s more, there is also no evidence that exposure to low-level electromagnetic fields puts someone’s health at risk.

No, HIPAA doesn’t prohibit businesses from asking about your vaccination status
","Misinformation is spreading on social media claiming that businesses aren’t allowed to ask customers if they’ve received a COVID-19 vaccine because it would violate health privacy laws.  But that’s wrong, and some posts making these claims have been flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Consumer privacy protections under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 — better known as HIPAA — are implemented with what’s called the Privacy Rule.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rule established a set of national standards to address how health care providers, insurers and other entities use and share people’s health information. The law is designed to prevent them from disclosing a patient’s private health information without that person’s permission.  The law doesn’t prohibit businesses from asking customers about their vaccination status.  Kayte Spector-Bagdady, a lawyer and associate director at the University of Michigan’s Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine, told WKYC, an NBC News affiliate in Cleveland, that people often think HIPAA protects them from having to answer questions about their medical information, or prohibits others from asking. ""Neither is true,"" Spector-Bagdady said. ""HIPAA prohibits health professionals, such as your doctor, from sharing your identified health information without your permission in most circumstances.

No, Fauci’s wife didn’t issue emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines
","In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its first emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine. An EUA is basically a greenlight for the agency to allow the use of unapproved medical products, such as a vaccine, during a public health emergency like the coronavirus pandemic.  Because all the evidence the FDA would usually require before approving a drug may not be available during a public health emergency, the FDA makes a judgment call based on the available information and a risk assessment. In this case, that means that three COVID-19 vaccines are now available to people in the United States even though clinical trials for these drugs are ongoing.  A claim spreading on social media wrongly claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci’s wife is responsible for making the decision about EUAs.  ""Fauci’s wife is NIH chief of bioethics and human subjects research!"" an Instagram post says. ""That means she’s the one who rubber stamps exceptions to normal drug and vaccine testing.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fauci’s wife, Christine Grady, is chief of bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, but she isn’t involved in issuing emergency use authorizations, the NIH told PolitiFact in a statement. ""As part of her official duties, Dr. Grady and her staff teach medical ethics and perform research into complex ethical issues related to medicine and clinical research,"" the agency said in the statement. And while staff members in the bioethics department are available for bioethics consultation on NIH research programs, Grady does not have authority to approve the conduct of any research protocol, ""and she has no input into the FDA process for issuing EUAs.""   Grady has weighed in on ethical considerations concerning the COVID-19 vaccine, but in a June 2020 story in Elle magazine, Grady described her job as more ""conceptual and empirical.""  ""She identifies, researches, and writes about ethical issues concerning COVID-19 vaccines, resource allocation, and the safety of healthcare workers during the pandemic,"" the story says. ""Now she’s spearheading research into the ethics of America’s COVID-19 response."" Grady was also quoted in a later Science magazine story about the potential ethical problems with granting emergency use authorizations for some vaccines while other candidates are still in the planning or trial phase, because half of the participants in any ongoing studies would get a placebo at a time when a vaccine that has been shown to protect against COVID-19 is already available.  ""It’s a very vexing issue,"" she said.  The first emergency use authorization for civilians was issued in 2009 and signed by Joshua Sharfstein, then acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It was during the H1N1 pandemic, and he gave some insight into the process in a Q&A that was published on Johns Hopkins University’s website in October.  ""There was a question of using Tamiflu — which was a medication for flu which had dosing approved by the FDA — for very little babies. People were worried that H1N1 could affect them, but Tamiflu hadn’t been well studied for infants,"" he said. ""So we brought together the best minds at the FDA to come up with a recommended dosing for young infants.

No proof that drugs not approved in US for COVID-19 caused drop in cases in India
","On May 17, the New York Times reported that the coronavirus crisis was so severe in India, with about 23 million infections confirmed, that the country was accounting for more than half of the world’s daily COVID-19 cases.  The same day, The Gateway Pundit posted a story suggesting that two drugs — both of which have drawn warnings from U.S. and global public health officials not to be used for COVID-19 — were having dramatic effects in India.  The headline, widely shared on Facebook, read: ""Elites Worried: COVID Cases in India Plummet After Government Promotes Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine Use."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Daily COVID-19 cases in India decreased in the days before May 17 —  but only after a nearly vertical rise that started in April and peaked May 8. The Indian government has recommended limited use of the two drugs for COVID-19, but there is no evidence that their use led to the drop in cases.  Neither drug is approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. And both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization recommend against using them to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infection.  The Gateway Pundit article was written by the site’s founder and editor-in-chief, Jim Hoft, whose Twitter account was permanently suspended in February for ""repeated violations"" of Twitter’s policies on election-related messages, according to news reports. The Gateway Pundit article links to another article that links to revised guidelines issued April 28 by India’s Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The guidelines, for ""home isolation of mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 cases,"" recommends considering ivermectin as treatment for those patients, and says people in close contact with those patients should take hydroxychloroquine as a prevention ""as per protocol and as prescribed by the treating medical officer.""  Hoft did not respond to a request for evidence to support his claim. Confirmed new COVID-19 cases in India declined in the days before the article was posted, based on a seven-day rolling average — but only after reaching a peak following a sharp increase that started in April.  The seven-day average of new daily cases was 319,497 on May 17, the date of the post, down from a peak of 391,232 on May 8, according to Our World in Data. The U.S. average was 32,036 on May 17. Many experts caution that the Indian government’s official tallies of confirmed cases likely vastly underestimate the actual infection figures because testing remains limited and the volume of cases has crippled the health care system in some areas. So the actual extent of the decline is not clear. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are being widely used in India for COVID-19, according to news reports. But there is no evidence they led to the recent decline in confirmed cases, given the lack of clear scientific evidence that they are effective at all in prevention or treatment. The government’s new guidelines don’t give a rationale for the recommendations. They were issued several days after a research paper was published that said ""results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials,"" including some done in India, ""report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin.""  Doctors in India admitted to have prescribed the drug under compulsion, peer pressure or on patient’s demand, according to one news report . The health minister in Goa was quoted as saying ivermectin does not prevent a COVID-19 infection, but helps in reducing the severity of the disease.  Hydroxychloroquine has been in use much longer. In June 2020, a task force of India’s health ministry recommended that frontline health care workers take it to prevent COVID-19 infection. According to the journal Nature, the task force cited three new studies conducted by government agencies, only one of which had been published, that the task force said showed it can prevent infection. Leading U.S. and global health authorities recommend against using the two drugs for COVID-19. In March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of hydroxychloroquine, which is FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria, for certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But the FDA revoked its authorization less than three months later, after determining ""it is no longer reasonable"" to believe that it may be effective in treating COVID-19, ""nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks.""  The FDA continues to recommend against using it for COVID-19. In guidelines issued March 2 on drugs to prevent COVID-19, the World Health Organization said: ""We recommend against administering hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis to individuals who do not have COVID-19 — strong recommendation, high certainty evidence."" And in guidelines issued March 31 on treating COVID-19, the organization gave a ""strong recommendation against hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 of any severity."" In the treatment guidelines, the World Health Organization said: ""We recommend not to use ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 except in the context of a clinical trial,"" citing ""very low certainty evidence"" about the drug. The FDA, in an article March 5, said ivermectin should not be used to prevent or treat COVID-19. Ivermectin, which is FDA-approved to treat conditions caused by parasitic worms and parasites such as lice, in large doses ""is dangerous and can cause serious harm."" An FDA posting April 26 noted that a June 2020 research article described the effect of ivermectin on the coronavirus in a laboratory setting, but that more testing is needed to determine whether ivermectin might be appropriate to prevent or treat coronavirus or COVID-19. In April, we rated as False a claim on social media that ""mountains of data"" show drug ivermectin ""basically obliterates"" COVID-19 transmission. Some limited studies suggest that ivermectin can help treat COVID-19; others show no significant impact. Many of the studies had small sample sizes and other limitations. ""It would therefore be premature to conclude absolutely that ivermectin has no place in COVID-19 treatment,"" Gordon Dent, a senior lecturer in pharmacology at Keele University School of Medicine in England, wrote in April. ""On the basis of current evidence, however, its use cannot be recommended."" The Gateway Pundit claimed: ""COVID cases in India plummet after government promotes ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine use."" COVID-19 cases in India, one of the worst-hit countries in the world by the coronavirus, dropped in mid-May only after a nearly vertical spike in cases over the previous several weeks. The Indian government has given limited recommendations for using the two drugs in connection with mild COVID-19 cases. There is no evidence that the two drugs caused or contributed to a decline in cases in India. Neither is approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. And both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization recommend against using them to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infections, citing lack of scientific evidence of their effectiveness and the potential for serious side effects.

Eric Trump misidentifies mansion as Biden’s
","Social media users are circulating a claim about a house purportedly owned by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and questioning how he could afford it on a government salary. Eric Trump, President Donald Trump’s son, tweeted the aerial-view photo of the Delaware mansion with this comment: ""The salary of a U.S. senator is $174,000 per year. This is Joe Biden’s house. ... seems legit."" The tweet has been shared more than 50,000 times. The salary of a U.S. senator rose to $174,000 in 2009, the year Biden left the chamber to become vice president. But Eric Trump’s tweet juxtaposed that figure with the photo of a mansion that hasn’t belonged to Biden in nearly 25 years. Biden bought the house in 1975 for $185,000, then sold it in 1996 after major renovations. The image comes from a Wall Street Journal article about Biden’s real estate investments. Wall Street Journal staffers confirmed they used Pictometry, an aerial imaging service, to download the satellite image of the property. The same article reported that Biden purchased the DuPont mansion in 1975 for $185,000, and sold it in 1996 for $1.2 million. He does not currently own it.  A parcel search for the Delaware address on New Castle County’s website confirmed that Biden sold the property in 1996. The New York Times also reported the sale in a 2008 article, which said Biden initially bought the property after he learned it was slated for demolition.  The Eric Trump tweet cites a Senate salary figure of $174,000 to suggest that the mansion would have been beyond Biden’s means. Biden’s salary as a senator varied from $42,500 a year when he began serving in the Senate in 1973, to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. As vice president, he earned up to $230,700 a year, and his wife, Jill, continued her teaching career.  But after he left office, both Bidens wrote books, and his financial disclosure form lists dozens of speaking engagements and book-tour events that typically earned him five- and six-figure payments each. The couple, who file their taxes jointly, reported adjusted gross income of about $11 million in 2017. Biden’s campaign confirmed that he owns two Delaware properties, a house on a 4-acre lakefront lot in Wilmington and a vacation house on Rehoboth Beach, Del. The campaign also directed PolitiFact to Richard Ben Cramer’s book, ""What It Takes,"" which describes some of the work Biden put into the home he sold. The Trump campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment. The tweet claimed that a photo of a Delaware mansion was Biden’s current home, and appears to question how he paid for the property with a senator’s salary. Biden bought the mansion in 1975 for $185,000, when his salary was about $42,500, then sold it in 1996 for $1.2 million after a renovation. He does not live there.

Pence uses outdated numbers to tout Wisconsin job gains and unemployment numbers
","In the run-up to the Nov. 3 election, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have been frequent visitors to Wisconsin. So, you’d think by now they’d have their talking points about the state right. In an Oct. 11, 2020, news release announcing Pence’s visit two days later to Waukesha, his office claimed the administration’s economic policies ""led to an unemployment rate of 3.1% in Wisconsin and 61,000 jobs, including 15,000 manufacturing jobs since President Trump took office."" But those numbers are all from before the coronavirus pandemic cratered the nation’s economy.  So, what’s the full picture? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate for August 2020 was 6.2%. Those numbers are preliminary, but the most recent available. In any case, that’s double the rate cited by Pence. We reached out to Pence’s office seeking backup for the claim, but they did not offer an explanation for the discrepancy.  But our examination of the numbers found the news release appears to be citing the March 2020 unemployment rate. The rate was that low – 3.1% – at the time, but climbed dramatically in the wake of COVID-fueled shutdowns across the country. Here is the fuller picture: When Trump took office in January 2017, the Wisconsin unemployment rate was at 3.6%, and had been on a downward trend through 2016. In 2017, the unemployment rate continued to decrease and then held steady for some months at 3%. It was at 3.1% in January 2019, and gradually increased until a sharp decline between February 2020 (3.5%) and March 2020 (3.1%). But it has spiked since then. In short, Pence used outdated numbers to paint a rosier-than-reality picture. The second number the release cites is the number of jobs added in Wisconsin. The difference between the January 2017 numbers, when Trump took office, and the preliminary numbers for August 2020 shows a net loss of 181,900 jobs in Wisconsin.  If you use February 2017, the month after President Trump’s inauguration, as a starting point, there is an even bigger net loss of 185,000 Wisconsin jobs.  To be sure, there are many cautions about this approach. The preliminary numbers can sometimes change considerably before they are made final. And the BLS prefers to compare year-over-year numbers – i.e. January to January – due to seasonal employment changes. But the comparison underlines a stark difference due to the economic fallout of coronavirus – something ignored by Pence’s numbers. In any case, it’s unclear where Pence’s office got the increase of 61,000 jobs. Despite our request, they did not offer an explanation. We looked at the numbers in a variety of ways, including whether they represented a high-water mark for some point during his presidency, but could not crack the code. One way to get 61,000 jobs is to take the difference between October 2016 – when President Trump had not been elected, let alone took office – (2,932,700 nonfarm jobs) and February 2020 (2,993,700 nonfarm jobs), the highest tally under Trump.  The same ignore-the-pandemic problem holds here. Between January 2017 and August 2020 there was a net loss of 9,200 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.  It seems Pence’s office got the 15,000 gain by taking the difference between January 2017 and March 2020. In the news release, Pence’s office said the administration ""enacted pro-growth policies, which led"" to the numbers cited. That leads us to the issue of credit and blame – something we always consider when politicians make such boasts. For instance, when former Gov. Scott Walker touted similar numbers when in office, economists noted he could not take full credit because the state is affected by many national and global economic forces and trends. The same scenario applies here, in reverse.  Finally, it’s worth noting that Trump has argued he should be judged mainly on how the economy was performing before the pandemic.  But he has taken credit for recent bounceback growth and noted – especially when defending his late-in-term Supreme Court nomination – that he is elected to a full four-year term, not a partial term. What’s more, the news release itself used the phrase ""since President Trump took office,"" not ""in the first 38 months of President Trump’s term."" Pence claimed in a news release that since he and Trump took office, their policies ""led to an unemployment rate of 3.1% in Wisconsin and 61,000 jobs, including 15,000 manufacturing jobs."" Those numbers may have been high-water marks before the pandemic, but they ignore the current reality. Even then, they overstate the credit for improvements that are driven by many economic forces. We rate Pence’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3E5D80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/20/mike-pence/pence-uses-outdated-numbers-tout-wisconsin-job-gai/

Did Spanberger, other House Democrats, vote to use public money for their campaigns?
","Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger wants the public to pay for her campaign, according to Nick Freitas, her Republican challenger this fall. ""Washington Democrats love to spend your money,"" says a Freitas TV ad. ""They even voted to spend public public funds on their political campaigns; up to $5 million each for travel expenses, staffers, even TV ads. And Abigail Spanberger voted with them, not you."" The ad flashes grainy videos of three Democrats often targeted by conservatives:  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff of California, and Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. It ends with videos of Spanberger. The narrator says, ""Washington Democrats and Abigail Spanbereger: They flood your TV with attack ads; you get stuck with the bills."" We fact checked whether Spanberger voted to give politicians up to $5 million for their campaigns. A similar claim against Spanberger was made last month in a TV ad by the conservative Congressional Leadership Fund. The charge is cropping up in ads against incumbent Democrats in races across the country. The ads target votes that Spanberger and other House Democrats cast on March 8, 2019 for the ""For the People Act of 2019,""  a 705-page bill that would expand voting rights, limit gerrymandering, strengthen ethics rules and reduce the influence of private donor money in politics. Spanberger was among 236 Democrats who cosponsored the measure. It passed the House on a starkly partisan 234-193  vote, with all participating Democrats supporting it, and all participating Republicans voting no. The bill has not been taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate. Campaign financing proposal The bill would provide a 6-to-1 match for small-dollar donations ($200 or less), and create a pilot program in three states to provide $25 vouchers for eligible voters to give to their favored candidates for Congress. Freitas’ ad gives the impression that everyone running for federal office would get public funding, but that’s not the case.  Participation in the program would be optional. A candidate would have to agree not to accept any single contribution of more than $200, and any aggregate donations from an individual or PAC of more than $1,000. Each of those contributions, and voucher money, could receive the 6-to-1 match. To qualify for the program, a candidate would have to raise at least $50,000 in small-dollar donations from at least 1,000 individuals. Ray La Raja, professor of political science and an expert in campaign finance at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has told PolitiFact that the eligibility requirements would make the matching program attractive to some candidates more than others. ""My hunch is that many Democrats would participate under the reform, but probably not those who expect highly competitive elections,"" he said. ""They would not want to risk coming up short of money for the campaign."" ""Additionally, candidates who have ideological followings will likely benefit from this program,"" he added. ""Ideological candidates tend to draw more small donors."" Freitas and other Republicans say the bill would allow up to $5 million in public financing for a candidate. The figure comes from a Bloomberg Government estimate in January 2019. Who pays for the funding? Freitas’ ad tells viewers ""you get stuck with the bill,"" suggesting the general public would pay for the matching funds. That’s not correct. The money actually would come from a new ""Freedom From Influence Fund"" under the U.S. Treasury, which would collect a 2.75 percent surcharge on criminal and civil fines and penalties or settlements with banks and corporations that commit corporate malfeasance. It should be noted, however, that the source of money for the matches was not specified in the version of the bill that Spanberger and other Democrats co-sponsored on Jan. 9, 2019. The fines against banks and corporations were added to the bill on March 5. The final bill seals off the possibility that individual and household taxpayers’ money would seep into the fund. It says if the Freedom From Influence Fund runs out of money, no money can be drawn from other sources. The bill allows payments for vouchers and grants to be reduced if the fund runs low. Our ruling Freitas’s ad says Spanberger and other Democrats ""voted to spend public funds on their political campaigns; up to $5 million...""  The claim refers to votes Spanberger and 233 of her Democratic House colleagues cast on March 8, 2019 for a bill that would provide a 6-to-1 match on small-dollar contributions to congressional candidates. Bloomberg News estimates candidates could receive as much as $5 million apiece in federal support. Although the bill would be a step towards public financing of congressional campaigns, Freitas glosses over some important details: Participation in the program would be optional, and against the interests of many Democratic and Republican candidates. To be eligible for the match, candidates would have to refuse aggregate contributions from any individual of  more than $1,000. The program would not receive tax dollars paid by individuals and households. It would be funded by a 2.75 percent surcharge on civil and criminal fines paid by banks and corporations.

Trump falsely says federal debt was going down before the pandemic
","As he pitched his economic agenda to a group of business leaders, President Donald Trump claimed that the United States was about to pay off federal debt, but then the coronavirus pandemic hit and derailed those plans. David Rubenstein, president of the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., asked Trump during an Oct. 14 virtual discussion whether another stimulus bill would increase the federal debt to an amount that would be ""too large for us to pay off in a sensible way."" Trump said that the debt was very much on his mind. ""Prior to the plague, we were starting to get that number down. We were getting that number, the interest rates were so low and we were seeing things on such a positive scale, we had no choice but to put money in,"" Trump said. ""You had to put money in, you had to force money in because of the pandemic, but we were starting to focus on that very, very deeply. We were making it long-term, we were getting ready to pay off interest, we were getting ready to pay off debt, and a lot of good things were happening."" The federal debt was going down before the pandemic hit? By multiple metrics, Trump’s claim doesn’t check out. We asked the White House and Trump’s reelection campaign for information but did not hear back. To finance its activities, the U.S. government issues securities to private investors overseas, central banks of other countries, and U.S. buyers, such as the Federal Reserve System, banks, mutual funds, and individual people. This type of debt — over $21 trillion as of Oct. 14 —  makes up the bulk of the federal debt and is known as the ""debt held by the public."" The ""total debt"" or ""gross debt"" — surpassing $27 trillion — includes the debt held by the public plus Treasury securities held by U.S. government accounts and federal trust funds, like Social Security and Medicare. Debt held by federal accounts is essentially an IOU from one part of the government to another, so most experts focus on the public debt, not the total debt, said Donald Marron, a fellow and director of the Economic Policy Initiatives at Urban Institute. Data for both metrics show increases before the pandemic and before Congress approved a stimulus package to help businesses and individuals struggling with the pandemic. While economists mainly focus on debt held by the public because it is ""external debt"" and must be repaid to avoid default, total debt is ""just as important because federal lawmakers are always quick to say that they are going to pay back ‘every cent owed’ to Social Security and Medicare,"" said Tori Gorman, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates for fiscal responsibility. Marron told PolitiFact that analysts also often look at the ratio of the debt to the gross domestic product, a measure of the overall economy called GDP, rather than just the debt in dollar terms, because it puts the debt into context and helps for comparisons over time and across countries. Trump’s claim isn’t supported by this metric, either. ""Overall, the trend is clear — debt growing faster than the economy,"" Marron said. A September report from the Government Accountability Office projected that debt held by the public would reach 98% of GDP by the end of fiscal year 2020. ""At a time when the federal government’s ability to fiscally respond to COVID-19 is crucial, the high level of federal debt that existed prior to the pandemic is continuing to strain the federal budget,"" the report said. In March, before the fiscal and economic effects of COVID-19, the office had already projected that debt as a share of GDP in 2050 would be nearly twice its historical high of 106% reached in 1946 — and about four times its post-World War II average. (Debt averaged 46% of GDP from 1946 through 2019, the report said.) ""The president may have been planning to reduce the debt, or even pay it off, but that doesn’t make it true,"" Gorman said. ""It’s like me saying ‘I’m planning to win the Masters golf tournament next year.’ It’s meaningless (and also highly unlikely)."" Trump’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal also doesn’t show a plan to reduce the debt. A Congressional Budget Office March analysis of Trump’s 2021 budget shows that the debt, measured as a percent of GDP, rises every year of the budget window, fueled by large and rising deficits, Gorman said. Speaking of the federal debt before the coronavirus pandemic, Trump said, ""we were starting to get that number down."" Trump’s claim is not supported by government data and analyses. Public debt and gross debt have gone up during Trump’s presidency. Debt as a percentage of the GDP has also increased throughout his administration. We rate Trump’s claim False.

Progressive group highlights Trump, Tillis weakness on insulin price tags
","During the first presidential debate of 2020, President Donald Trump touted his efforts to curb skyrocketing drug prices and declared that insulin is now ""so cheap, it’s like water."" The response on social media was swift, and divided, with some people sharing pharmacy bills showing thousands of dollars they’d spent on insulin, while others boasted of newfound savings. The next day, a self-described progressive political action committee called Change Now jumped into the fray by releasing an ad that circulated on Facebook attacking Trump and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., on this issue. In the 30-second ad, a North Carolina woman in her 30s explains she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 4. ""Donald Trump and Thom Tillis opposed legislation that would lower the price of insulin and other prescription drugs,"" she says. ""People with diabetes can’t afford to wait for Trump and Tillis to fight for us. ... We need affordable insulin now."" (Posts sharing the quote were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) In recent years, politicians on both sides of the aisle have committed to addressing the cost of insulin. This election cycle — coinciding with a looming threat to the Affordable Care Act and millions of people losing jobs and employer-sponsored health insurance during the pandemic — the high price of prescription drugs has gained new significance. Tillis is in one of the most heated Senate races in the country and has been repeatedly criticized by his opponent for receiving more than $400,000 in campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical and health product industries. Across the country, many voters say lowering prescription drug costs should be the top health priority for elected officials. So, did Trump and Tillis really oppose policies that would accomplish that goal? We decided to take a closer look. It turns out they’ve both opposed certain pieces of legislation that could have lowered the price of insulin and other prescription drugs, but they’ve also offered alternatives. The question is how aggressive those alternatives are and how many Americans would benefit from them. Change Now pointed to two congressional bills to support the ad’s claim: one opposed by Trump, and the other by Tillis. The first bill, known as H.R. 3, passed the House in December 2019, largely due to Democratic votes. It contains three main elements: decreasing out-of-pocket costs for people on Medicare, penalizing pharmaceutical companies that raise the price of drugs faster than the rate of inflation and — the most aggressive and controversial feature — allowing the federal government, which administers Medicare, to negotiate the price of certain drugs, including insulin. It also requires manufacturers to offer those agreed-on prices to private insurers, extending the benefits to a wider swath of Americans. Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, called it ""the broadest-reaching policy that has been put forward"" on drug pricing. ""While a lot of reform has focused on Medicare beneficiaries, that misses many insulin users,"" Dusetzina said. ""H.R. 3 does the most to affect prices for young consumers, like the woman in the ad."" At the time, Trump vowed to veto that bill, saying the price controls it imposed ""would likely undermine access to lifesaving medications"" by decreasing the incentive for companies to innovate. When we checked in with the Trump campaign about the ad, a spokesperson reiterated this position, adding that the president continues to seek better legislative options. The House bill in question, though, never made it to the president’s desk because the Senate didn’t take it up. Instead, the Senate Finance Committee proposed its own bill, which brings us to the second piece of legislation cited by Change Now. Known as the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, the Senate bill echoes two aims of the House proposal: decreasing out-of-pocket costs for people on Medicare and putting an inflation-based cap on some drug prices. That bill, too, stalled, with several Republican senators wary of the inflation cap. Among them was Tillis, who expressed concern that the measure could hamper innovation. So it’s true that Trump and Tillis have both opposed legislation that could lower the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs. But that’s not the full picture of what either politician has done on this issue. The Trump campaign provided a long list of actions taken by his administration to curb the high costs of medication, including a flurry of executive orders related to insulin and prescription drugs. Tillis’ campaign highlighted an alternative bill the senator co-sponsored to target drug costs. Let’s break them down one at a time. One of Trump’s orders aims to have Federally Qualified Health Centers provide insulin and EpiPens at a discounted rate to the low-income individuals they serve. These centers, however, are already required to offer sliding-scale payments, and a full discount to patients who earn below the federal poverty line, said Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, who tracks drug-pricing laws. Another order deals with the importation of drugs from Canada, where they are often cheaper. Although the order specifically excludes biologic drugs, including insulin, the administration has requested proposals from private companies on how insulin could be safely brought in from other countries. The president also issued a particularly ambitious order that seeks to tie the price Medicare pays for drugs to a lower international reference price. The Trump administration, however, hasn’t released final regulations to implement that policy, which could take years. If implemented, the policy is expected to be challenged in court by the drug industry. Perhaps the most notable measure on insulin at the moment, experts said, is a federal demonstration project that Medicare plans can voluntarily opt into, to cap the monthly copay for insulin at $35 for some seniors. The project is slated to begin in January 2021, but its long-term future is uncertain, Sachs said, because it relies on parts of the Affordable Care Act, which could be struck down by a Supreme Court ruling later this year. In Congress, Tillis and five other Republican senators introduced an alternative drug-pricing bill last December, called the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. Tillis believes this is ""the better option,"" campaign spokesperson Andrew Romeo said, because ""in addition to helping control drug prices, the legislation also seeks to preserve America's capacity to research and develop lifesaving medications."" It includes a monthly cap on insulin copays for Medicare beneficiaries and requires manufacturers to disclose prices in consumer ads. But experts said Tillis’ proposal is weaker than other options before the House and Senate. It doesn’t include an inflation cap, Sachs said, and the bill’s benefit would likely be limited to some seniors on Medicare, leaving out the more than 150 million Americans covered by private insurance. Jason Roberts, an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said the bill is largely symbolic. ""Tillis is getting hit for not supporting a bill that could move,"" Roberts said. ""Instead, he introduces something that has no chance of going anywhere, and he knows that. But it’s a way of trying to deflect that criticism without getting a lot accomplished."" An ad sponsored by a progressive political action committee claims that Trump and Tillis have opposed legislation that would decrease the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs. Based on the two pieces of drug-pricing legislation Change Now points to, that’s accurate. Trump and Tillis have voiced opposition to prominent bills that experts say could decrease the cost of insulin for a broad group of Americans. Both politicians have proposed alternative policies to lower the price of insulin and other prescription drugs, but most of their proposals have not taken effect yet and are largely targeted at seniors.

Arizona House race attack ad zeroes in on prescription drug prices
","Handicappers rate the House race in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District as a toss-up, with the edge going to the Republican incumbent, David Schweikert.  The high cost of prescription drugs resonates in retiree-heavy Arizona and a major union backing Democrat Hiral Tipirneni in the race has taken Schweikert to task for his voting record on the issue. ""David Schweikert took over $120,000 from the drug industry and voted against legislation to lower prescription drug prices,"" an Oct. 7 Facebook ad from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said. Schweikert did get that much money from the pharmaceutical sector in his time in office. And he did vote against a major Democratic bill that outside analysts said would push down drug prices. On the other hand, Schweikert backed a Republican bill that would have insulated millions of Medicare recipients from out-of-pocket costs, without doing as much to drive down drug prices.  In this fact-check, we look at how both bills tackled rising prices, and whether protecting some patients from higher costs is the same as reining in underlying prices themselves. We made several efforts to connect with Schweikert’s staff and did not hear back. According to the Center of Responsive Politics, since 2011, Schweikert received $124,902 from the pharmaceutical/health supply sector. His support grew from a low of $10,100 in the 2014 election cycle, to $39,102 in the current one. The industry went from being Schweikert’s 26th largest donor in 2012, to being his eighth largest today. In December 2019, the House passed the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act on a largely party line vote. (No Democrats voted against the bill and only two Republicans voted for it.) Under the bill’s most sweeping element, the government would negotiate with drug companies on the prices of as many as 250 drugs. Those prices wouldn’t simply apply to government insurance programs like Medicare. Private insurers could use them, too. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that in the course of 10 years, this would reduce government spending by $456 billion. The CBO left no uncertainty over the bill’s impact. ""The lower prices under the bill would immediately lower current and expected future revenues for drug manufacturers, change manufacturers’ incentives, and have broad effects on the drug market,"" the CBO told Congress. The CBO also estimated that the revenue reductions would have an impact on the drug industry. Overall, it would stand in the way of between eight and 15 new drugs coming to market over the decade. The drug industry’s leading trade group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, vigorously opposed the Democratic bill, warning of ""devastating"" effects on drug innovation and jobs in the pharmaceutical sector. The bill also pressured drug makers to reduce prices on many drugs covered by Medicare. If the price of a drug had gone up faster than inflation, the company could either cut the price, or pay a rebate to Washington. The Republican bill — the Lower Costs, More Cures Act — did not include either of those two Democratic elements. But the two parties found something approaching common ground on the topic of capping out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients, although the levels of the caps differed. The Republicans capped out-of-pocket costs at $3,100, and the Democrats capped them lower, at $2,000.  There were a number of other elements in both bills, but these three pieces capture the bulk of the moves that would directly affect what people pay for prescription drugs. Here’s a summary: Schweikert voted against the Democratic bill, and was one of 147 co-sponsors of the Republican bill. From the point of view of anyone on Medicare facing the high cost of prescription drugs, a cap on out-of-pocket costs would deliver welcome relief. Both the Republican and Democratic proposals would help millions of people.  Both bills would insulate Medicare recipients from the highest costs, said University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill health care policy professor Jonathan Oberlander, but it’s reach is limited. ""A cap can of course provide meaningful help to those who spend large amounts on medications,"" Oberlander said. ""But it doesn’t help those subject to high prices whose total spending is still under the cap."" Georgetown University professor Jack Hoadly said, ""Help with out-of-pocket costs does not address drug prices."" ""It simply transfers more of the cost to either the government or the drug plan,"" Hoadly said. ""Eventually those costs will come back to beneficiaries in higher premiums."" The Republican bill did include some elements that indirectly could keep prices lower. It aimed to stop drug makers from abusing patent protections and blocking the entry of cheaper generic drugs. ""Over time that could have an impact on prices,"" said Washington University in St. Louis law professor Rachel Sachs. In contrast, Sachs said, the Democratic bill targeted drug prices directly with impacts that went beyond Medicare beneficiaries. ""Either through negotiating with the drug makers or discouraging them from raising prices faster than inflation, that would touch a broad cross section of Americans,"" Sachs said. The Congressional Budget Office analysis gave an idea of how much money taxpayers would save on prescription drugs under the Democratic bill. The CBO did not do a similar analysis of the Republican measure.  But analyst Juliette Cubanski at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care policy data, said if the CBO had scored the Republican bill ""it would definitely have gotten a much smaller savings estimate.""  ""HR3 (the Democratic bill) included more provisions than HR19 (the Republican bill)  to cap drug price increases and attempt to lower prices overall,"" Cubanski said.  A Facebook ad from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said Schweikert got over $120,000 from the drug industry and voted against a bill to lower prescription drug prices.  Schweikert received $124,902 from the drug and health products industry since he entered Congress. He voted against a bill that would have had a significant impact on drug prices and was projected to cut industry revenues by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. He backed a bill that would insulate millions of Medicare recipients from high out-of-pocket costs. According to multiple independent assessments, that alone would not drive down prices. Some measures in the bill could reduce some drug prices over time through competition from generic drugs.

SC House candidate Nancy Mace hedges, but doesn’t outright confirm climate change
","The re-election campaign of U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., created a website for attacking his opponent, Republican state Rep. Nancy Mace. ""Nancy Mace denies climate change"" is one of Cunningham’s claims on MaceFacts.com. In statements made since September, Mace has not always ruled out the impact of human beings, but she has consistently resisted an embrace of climate change. Several times, she has suggested the science is inconclusive.  The race pitting Mace, a state representative since 2018, against first-time House member Cunningham is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.  The Cook Political Report rates the match-up as ""lean Democratic,"" meaning the race is competitive but Cunningham has an advantage. According to NASA, the Earth’s climate has changed throughout history. But ""the current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely — greater than 95% probability — to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia."" Evidence for the ""rapid climate change"" includes a global temperature rise, warming of the oceans and shrinking ice sheets. Here’s a look at six sets of statements Mace has made, focusing on instances where she has spoken at some length. At a Sept. 3 event sponsored by the Post and Courier, a newspaper in Charleston, a reporter who said he was posing a question from a reader asked Mace if she believes in climate change. Mace began her answer by saying:  ""I’m kind of mixed on this. I’m not a scientist, and I’ve read science on both sides of this issue. To me, it’s not clear cut. I know that here in downtown Charleston, we’re seeing rising sea levels. And that could be a product of the climate, but that’s also partially a product of the peninsula being largely built on landfill in many places."" When the reporter followed up by asking Mace what she’s not sure about, Mace said: ""So, if you look at the history of Earth, we’ve had climate changes many times, over 130 times over millions of years. And so part of it might be man-made; part of it might be just natural environmental causes as part of the cycle of Earth."" She added: ""I think it’s more complicated than people really realize. You can’t say one or the other when there’s data on both sides of the issue. And I read about scientists that have flipped from one side to the other — both ways — so it’s hard to understand and know which one is right."" The Washington Examiner reported Sept. 11 that it asked Mace to clarify her position on climate change.  Mace replied, according to the newspaper, that ""she is ‘not a scientist’ and acknowledged sea levels are rising, but whether it is caused by ‘man-made’ climate change or natural reasons is ‘up for debate.’"" In a questionnaire, the Post and Courier asked Cunningham and Mace: ""Do you believe in climate change?"" The answers were published Sept. 13, with Mace saying: ""I’m not a scientist, but I do know we should consider all available data. South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District is in a unique part of the country subject to massive flooding and Atlantic storms, compounded by our low elevation."" At their first debate, on Sept. 28, Cunningham and Mace were asked if they ""agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that climate change is happening due to manmade greenhouse emissions leading to an increase in extreme weather events."" Mace replied: ""My opponent is going to tell you I’m a climate denier, which is dishonest. My opponent has said that the science is settled on this. Well, the science is never settled. Scientists will tell you that. I look at the issue from every angle and try to find a solution, as I’ve done as a state lawmaker. Scientists once said the Earth was flat and it’s not, and so these things are evolving, as well."" At their second and final scheduled debate, on Oct. 7, Cunningham and Mace were asked about what has caused a recent rise in the sea level in the area and what they would do about it. Mace said: ""Our Earth has had over 130 climate changes over its history. We are facing great climate change. We’re seeing an increase in the number of hurricanes, sea levels are rising."" In response to Cunningham’s attack, Mace’s campaign cited to PolitiFact an article published Oct. 14 in the Charleston City Paper. The newspaper said it asked Mace if humans are causing climate change, and she responded: ""Does man contribute to it? I mean, a lot of the science says that,  too, but I want to stay informed and do as much as we can, but the other thing that’s important to me is that we just cannot simply rely on the United States (to address it)."" Cunningham’s claim that Mace ""denies climate change"" is accurate, but needs some clarification. Mace has hedged on the issue, saying the science isn’t conclusive.

A child’s presence at school doesn’t automatically enroll them in a WHO vaccine program
","A Facebook post implies that sending your child to school will automatically enroll them in one of the World Health Organization’s vaccination programs.  The post features an image of the WHO’s logo. Text above the image reads, ""BREAKING: WHO now says your child’s presence in school counts as ‘informed consent’ for vaccination - parental presence not required."" The post doesn’t provide any sources or supporting evidence. We found that it misleadingly describes the way in which the WHO defines informed consent. In addition, according to legal experts, the WHO has no power to determine public health policy in the United States or any other member country.  According to the WHO press office, the organization recommends that member countries instituting child vaccination programs receive consent from a parent or guardian through one of three different mechanisms: verbal, written, or implied.  The first two mechanisms are straightforward: Verbal consent means that a parent or guardian has accompanied their child to a vaccination and agreed to it in person. Written consent means that a parent or guardian has given their approval of the vaccination in writing.  The third mechanism, implied consent, is the most relevant to the claims of the post. According to the WHO, parents grant implied consent when they send their children to a vaccination session after being notified by health authorities that vaccinations will occur at that particular time and place.  For example, the WHO said in an email, ""the presence of the child at school on the vaccination date may be taken as implied consent if the parents have been informed that the vaccination would take place and given the opportunity to opt out or take appropriate steps to express their desire to do so."" The WHO published a document describing the difference between written, verbal, and implied forms of consent in 2014. The document notes that there are problems with implied consent, and it encourages countries to adopt other consent mechanisms ""that ensure that parents have been informed and agreed to the vaccination."" Something else to keep in mind as you see posts like these: The WHO does not control public health policy in the United States.  According to experts in global health law, the organization has no legal power in any of its member countries. The U.S. is still a member country of the WHO, although President Trump officially started the yearlong process to withdraw from the organization on Jul. 6, 2020. ""The WHO’s legal structure cannot dictate what goes on on the ground in individual countries, or municipalities,"" said Teneille Brown, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law.  Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who advises the WHO, agreed with Brown.  ""There are certain WHO treaties to which the U.S. has voluntarily signed up, like the International Health Regulations. But these treaties do not control U.S. law and there is nothing in the IHR that would require vaccination. That is solely within the U.S. sovereign power,"" he wrote in an email.  When asked point blank whether the WHO has any ability whatsoever to dictate vaccination policy in the United States, Gostin replied, ""Absolutely not."" A Facebook post says, the ""WHO now says your child’s presence in school counts as ‘informed consent’ for vaccination - parental presence not required."" The WHO told us that a child’s presence at school would only count as consent if a parent has received advance notice of a planned immunization and been given ample opportunity to opt out. Even if the post had accurately described a public statement by the WHO, the organization has no ability to determine vaccine policy in the United States. We rate this post False. ​",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CF1340>],/factchecks/2020/oct/19/facebook-posts/childs-presence-school-doesnt-automatically-enroll/

No, Biden didn’t say he lived in Section 8 housing as a boy
","A quote attributed to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden that’s being copied and pasted across Facebook garbles what he actually said about his upbringing.  ""Biden said ‘I lived in Section 8 housing as a little boy…’ Joe was 32 when Section 8 began in 1974,"" one such Facebook post says.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The claim seems to have originated from comments Biden made during an ABC News town hall on Oct. 15.  About 24 minutes into the town hall, Biden was asked what he had to say ""to young Black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to protect them."" Biden responded that there are two things he’s cared about throughout his career: enabling Black Americans to generate wealth and education. He talked about the importance of pre-kindergarten education and successfully completing 12 years of school after that. Then he pivoted to housing and affordability, and compared white homebuyers to Black homebuyers. If a house was built in a white neighborhood and then the same exact house was built in a Black neighborhood, the home in the Black neighborhood would be valued at 29% less than the home in the white neighborhood.  ""We’ve got to end this,"" Biden said.  He then talked about his own family history, saying that after his father lost his job he couldn’t afford to buy a home for years, but that once he did, the Biden family was able to start accumulating wealth. In the meantime, though, ""we lived in an apartment,"" Biden said, ""which became Section 8 housing much later."" Biden then says, ""It wasn’t — it was just normal apartments.""  He didn’t claim to live in Section 8 housing, a program that was authorized by Congress in 1974 to provide rental subsidies for eligible Americans. Biden would have been about 32 in 1974.

Foreign nationals pass English test to gain American citizenship
","Tensions over immigration have been flaring during the presidential election. So it’s not surprising that old arguments on the subject are finding newfound attention. ""Current federal law says you must know English to become a citizen. So why are foreign language ballots even printed?"" reads a popular Facebook post published in 2019 that is currently gaining traction. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Must foreign nationals learn English to become American citizens? For the most part, yes. People applying for citizenship must pass an English proficiency test. The test assesses ""the applicant’s ability to read, write, speak and understand English,"" explains U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This test requires applicants to use simple English vocabulary and grammar, ""which may include noticeable errors in pronouncing, constructing, spelling, and understanding completely certain words, phrases, and sentences,"" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues.  That means applicants don’t need to exhibit native-like fluency, just proficiency. ""An applicant may ask for words to be repeated or rephrased and may make some errors in pronunciation, spelling, and grammar and still meet the English requirement for naturalization,"" says U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. ""An officer should repeat and rephrase questions until the officer is satisfied that the applicant either fully understands the question or is unable to understand English."" Applicants must also take a civics test, which is administered in English. However, there are some exceptions to these requirements. For instance, applicants with medical disabilities may apply to be excused from these tests. People over the age of 50 who have resided legally in the U.S. for at least 20 years can opt to take the civics test in a different language. The federal government currently requires some U.S. regions to print ballots in languages other than English. The regions have significant Asian American, Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native populations, explains the Pew Research Center. So why are ballots printed in foreign languages? Many native-born U.S. citizens don’t speak English. Plenty of people born in the country grow up in foreign language households and don’t learn enough English to vote.  ""Citizens of language minorities have been effectively excluded from participation in the electoral process,"" explains the U.S. Justice Department. ""Among other factors, the denial of the right to vote of such minority group citizens is ordinarily directly related to the unequal educational opportunities afforded them resulting in high illiteracy and low voting participation."" The Facebook post claims, ""Current federal law says you must know English to become a citizen."" With some exceptions, this is generally correct. Most foreign nationals must pass an English proficiency test to become U.S. citizens.

Photo doesn’t show Trump rally in Florida. It was a music festival in Switzerland
","An image of a massive crowd on the streets is recirculating on social media. Only this time, it’s claimed as a photo of a recent Florida rally for President Donald Trump.  ""FLORIDA RALLY today….and the polls say Biden is winning,"" reads an Oct. 16 post by Rosa L Moreno-Hilburn. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Trump did hold a rally in Sanford, Fla., on Oct. 16. But the photo circulating on Facebook is not an image of Florida at all. It’s an image of Zurich, Switzerland, during an annual music festival before the coronavirus pandemic.  Street Parade Zurich is a music event hosted every year in August and brings a crowd of hundreds of thousands on the city’s streets and over the Quaibrücke bridge, captured in the photo. This year’s parade was canceled due to the coronavirus.  Street Parade Zurich President Joel Meier told PolitiFact the photo was taken on Aug. 11, 2018. A higher-resolution version of the image shared on Facebook can be found in Street Parade Zurich’s gallery from its 2018 event. Similar photos of the 2019 parade can also be found online.  Just a couple months ago, in August, Facebook users falsely claimed that the photo captured protests in Berlin against coronavirus restrictions. That viral rumor was widely debunked by PolitiFact, Agence France-Presse, Reuters and WUSA9, a CBS affiliate.  The Facebook post claimed that a photo showed massive crowds for a Trump rally in Florida on Oct. 16. The post used a dated photo of Street Parade Zurich, a music festival, over the city’s Quaibrucke bridge.

No, Nancy Pelosi was not photographed with Charles Manson ‘family’
","A black-and-white photo of nine members of the Charles Manson ""family,"" a Los Angeles cult responsible for several grisly murders, has been making rounds on social media. Circled in red is a woman in the back in a striped tank top, staring into the camera. Facebook users are convinced that woman is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It’s not.  ""Manson’s gang Nancy Pelosi circled,"" reads a recent post by Don Mentzer.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The woman circled in the photo is Mary Brunner, a prominent member of the Manson Family and Manson’s first recruit.  Brunner was first identified to PolitiFact by Joan Renner, a historian and expert on Los Angeles crimes. Renner recognized Brunner right away.  ""She has a very distinctive look,"" Renner said. ""You can take that to the bank.""  Renner didn’t know the origins of the photo, but said the setting looked like the Spahn Ranch, where members of the Manson Family stayed in the early 1970s after Manson was arrested in August 1969.  So we kept asking around.  Tom O’Neill, who wrote a book about the Manson Family, also confirmed Brunner’s identity. He connected PolitiFact with Bo Emerson, who collects documents and photos from the Manson case. He recognized the photo as one published in the August 1970 article of LIFE Magazine.  The photo was taken by Michael Haering, a Los Angeles photojournalist. Other photos of Brunner in the same outfit credited to Haering can be found online.  In 1968, Pelosi was living in New York City and had four children, Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hamill pointed out. She and her husband moved to San Francisco — about 370 miles away from the Spahn Ranch — in 1969, when they had their fifth child.  Renner said Manson and his cult despised politicians and would never have affiliated himself with a member of a prominent political family. ""Pelosi would’ve been on their ‘political piggies’ list,"" Renner said, referring to a term Manson often used to justify his killings. ""There’s no way in the world that she would’ve been anything else other than their possible victim.""  The Facebook post claimed that Pelosi was photographed with the Manson Family in the late 1960s.  The meme circled a woman in the middle back. She has been identified as Mary Brunner, a prominent member of the Manson Family. The photo was taken in 1970.

Rowden did not fully fund K-12 education for the first time in Missouri history
","State Sen. Caleb Rowden is trying his best to keep Missouri’s 19th District red with campaign ads stretched across social media touting his efforts in office. Rowden and his opponent, Democrat Judy Baker, have stressed public education, which has been historically underfunded by the state. A recent Facebook ad by Rowden’s campaign asks users to ""like"" his page ""to help re-elect State Senator Caleb Rowden who fully funded Missouri K-12 education for the first time in state history.""  What does it mean to ""fully fund"" public education? And does Rowden deserve credit? Missouri’s K-12 education is funded by a mix of local, state, and federal sources, with state sources accounting for about 40% of the total funds each year, according to the Missouri Budget Project. For decades, Missouri has been using what is called the foundation formula to determine the level of state funding for each of the more than 500 school districts in the state. This in turn provides a state funding target each fiscal year.  According to the State & Regional Fiscal Studies Unit at the University of Missouri, the foundation formula has gone through many revisions due to changing economic circumstances, court rulings, and modifications in how real and personal property is taxed in the state.  When the 1993 formula was deemed obsolete, a new foundation formula was adopted on July 1, 2006. It determines each district’s state aid by multiplying the weighted average daily attendance, which accounts for low-income, special education, and limited English proficiency students, by that of the minimum amount that will be spent on students in all districts to ensure all students receive an adequate education. That number is then adjusted based on local funding and local cost of living. Kim Rueben, director of the State and Local Finance Initiative at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us that the legislature has to meet the total dollar amount determined by the formula for K-12 education to be considered fully funded. ""It isn't necessarily uncommon for formulas or guarantees not to be fully funded,"" Rueben said.  The current formula wasn’t fully funded until 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year. It was again fully funded the following year.  Rowden did not respond to our requests for evidence to support the claim in his Facebook ad. But in April 2017, the Kansas City Star reported that a bipartisan group of senators voted on an amendment to fully fund K-12 education ""for the first time in history.""  Rowden did not sponsor the amendment. But the senator, who was sworn into office three months earlier, was among the 19 ""yeas"" to add $45 million and bring public education funding to a total of $3.4 billion, matching the formula’s yearly funding target.  We wondered whether previous formulas had been fully funded. So we asked someone who helped draft the prior formula in 1993, Otto Fajen, the legislative director at the Missouri National Education Association.  ""There has been multiple, sustained years of a fully funded K-12 education formula, as it stood under law at that time, throughout the ‘90s,"" Fajen said.  The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education provided us with a table that proves K-12 education was fully funded for the fiscal years 1994 through 2001. Rowden said he ""fully funded Missouri K-12 education for the first time in state history.""  He voted to approve a 2017 budget amendment to fully fund K-12. But he wasn’t a sponsor. And public education was fully funded in a previous formula for at least eight consecutive years from 1994 to 2001.  The statement is not accurate. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809743FC00>],/factchecks/2020/oct/16/caleb-rowden/rowden-did-not-fully-fund-k-12-education-first-tim/
