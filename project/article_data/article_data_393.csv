Zelensky’s shirt bears emblem of Ukraine armed forces, not Nazi cross
","Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has tried to justify his invasion by falsely claiming that the action was taken to ""denazify"" the country and its leadership. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and said he’s had family members who were killed in the Holocaust. Yet some social media users are spreading rumors that he wears a Nazi symbol on his shirt.  Their focus is on a symbol of a cross that can be seen on some of the green military T-shirts that Zelensky has worn in several virtual addresses. Implications that Zelensky is supporting Nazis by wearing the shirt can be found on Reddit and across Facebook. ""The 1933 German group wore that symbol,"" says one post that shows an image of Zelensky wearing the shirt with the cross circled alongside the text ""Nazi Iron Cross."" ""What exactly is going on here?"" questions a post on Twitter that shared the same image of Zelensky with a screenshot of a definition of the ""iron cross"" being a military decoration in the German empire and Nazi Germany. Some posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook. Zelensky did not wear a Nazi symbol. The cross on his shirt is the official emblem of Ukraine’s armed forces and includes the country’s coat of arms in the center. The emblem was officially adopted in September 2009 and is featured on the Ukrainian military’s website and social media accounts. Members of Congress give Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a standing ovation before he speaks in a virtual address to Congress in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, March 16, 2022. (AP) It features the tryzub, the blue and gold trident of Ukrainian medieval leader ​​Vladimir the Great, at the center of a crimson-colored cross. Researchers with the Anti-Defamation League, which studies and tracks extremism and anti-semitism around the world, confirmed to PolitiFact that Zelensky isn’t wearing a hate symbol.  The Iron Cross is a famous German military medal dating back to the 19th century, the ADL says on its website, and isn’t a hate symbol on its own. It was turned into a Nazi symbol when the regime superimposed a swastika in the center of the medal. Social media posts claim that a Nazi symbol can be seen on Zelensky’s T-shirts. This is wrong. The symbol visible on Zelensky’s shirt is the official emblem of Ukraine’s military and doesn’t represent a Nazi Iron Cross.

Yes, Evers gave COVID relief money to Planned Parenthood — but it’s not being used to fund abortions
","There are lots of things Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who’s running to unseat Evers this fall, don’t agree on.  One big one: How to treat Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the state’s largest reproductive health care provider.  Kleefisch, a Republican who opposes abortion, supported legislation under former Gov. Scott Walker that cut funding for Planned Parenthood in 2016. She’s touted that on the campaign trail as recently as last month.  Evers, a Democrat who backs abortion rights, campaigned on restoring funding to the organization, but has been stifled in his attempts to do so by the Republican-controlled Legislature.  He did, however, allocate a small portion of federal COVID-19 relief dollars to Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the state, which Kleefisch latched onto in a March 9, 2022 campaign email.  ""Tony Evers was caught giving $2.4 MILLION of our state’s federal COVID relief funds in grants to Planned Parenthood affiliates throughout Wisconsin to bail them out and fund abortions,"" the email reads.  A quick search of the state Department of Administration’s list of grantees shows those funds were indeed awarded to Planned Parenthood clinics.  But Kleefisch’s purported reason why Evers allocated the money is where her argument goes awry.  Let’s take a look.  When asked for evidence to back up the claim, Kleefisch’s communications director Alec Zimmerman sent two documents from the Department of Administration that list grant awards to Planned Parenthood.  The first grants were among those distributed to nonprofit organizations that provided ""critical services to individuals in the areas of health care, housing and shelter, adult education"" and other services, according to a Nov. 3, 2020 news release from Evers’ office announcing the grant program.  Evers directed $10 million of the state’s money from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act toward the grant program.  Twenty-one Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin clinic locations received grants that added up to $1.4 million.  Those included Appleton, Blair, Delavan, Eau Claire, Green Bay, Kenosha, La Crosse, Manitowoc, Oshkosh, Portage, Racine, Sparta, Waukesha, West Allis, West Bend and Wisconsin Rapids, as well as the Madison South clinic and Milwaukee’s Capitol, Mitchell Street, Northwest and Wisconsin Avenue locations.  Evers also awarded a $1 million-dollar grant to Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin on Feb. 8, 2022 as part of his Equitable Grant Recovery Program, aimed at supporting organizations that work to eliminate disparities in health, child development, education and other areas. A grant announcement from the Department of Administration said up to $82 million in grants may be given for those purposes.  This grant program, too, is using COVID relief dollars — this time from the federal American Rescue Plan Act.  So Kleefisch is right that Evers sent $2.4 million in grant money to Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin – though we’ll note he wasn’t ""caught"" doing it. Recipients were posted on a government web site. Her claim veers off track in the second half: Did Evers give the money to Planned Parenthood specifically to ""bail them out and fund abortions?""  ""The ‘bail out’ language was obviously general but it’s worth pointing out that the Walker/Kleefisch Administration stripped Planned Parenthood of its state funding so you have to wonder if the move to give them grants was intentional,"" Zimmerman wrote in an email.  That’s conjecture, not evidence. And, as noted, Planned Parenthood is a major provider of heath-care services. Abortion services make up a small share of the organization’s overall services — 3% in 2019, according to the latest annual national report. And in Wisconsin, only three clinics can provide them.  That’s the Madison East location, Milwaukee’s Water Street Health Center and the Sheboygan clinic.  None of those clinics got money from the nonprofit grant program.  Mike Murray, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said in an email that neither pot of funding would be used to fund abortion services as Kleefisch claimed.  All CARES Act money is explicitly prohibited from being used for abortions under the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal dollars from being used for that purpose in most cases. The ARPA funds aren’t restricted by Hyde, but in this case still are not being directed toward abortions. The CARES Act dollars went toward family planning services, treatment and testing for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, Murray said. The ARPA funding will support ""investments to reduce health inequities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic."" Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin does, of course, provide abortion services.  But Kleefisch didn’t say Evers gave money to an organization that performs those services. She said he gave them the money specifically to fund abortions.  That’s off the mark.  Kleefisch claimed Evers gave Planned Parenthood affiliates in Wisconsin $2.4 million in federal COVID relief money ""to bail them out and fund abortions.""  Evers did give them grants funds, but they’re not being used to pay for abortions.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  That fits here. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809748CBC0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/25/rebecca-kleefisch/yes-evers-gave-covid-relief-money-planned-parentho/

Ketanji Brown Jackson didn’t call Bush, Rumsfeld ‘war criminals’ as she defended Gitmo detainees
","From 2005 to 2007, Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson worked as a federal public defender, often representing clients who couldn’t afford lawyers of their own — including Guantanamo Bay detainees.  Republican senators have called Jackson’s experience as a federal public defender into question during her confirmation hearings.  Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, repeatedly claimed that, while defending clients accused of terrorism, Jackson called former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ""war criminals."" ""I don’t know you well, but I’ve been impressed by our interaction, and you’ve been gracious and charming,"" Cornyn said on March 22. ""Why in the world would you call Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and George W. Bush war criminals in a legal filing? It seems so out of character for you."" Jackson asked if he was referring to habeas petitions she’d filed, and Cornyn said he was talking about when she’d represented a man the Defense Department had identified as an ""intelligence officer for the Taliban."" ""You referred to the secretary of defense and the sitting president of the United States as ‘war criminals,’"" he said. ""I was representing my clients and making arguments,"" Jackson replied. ""I’d have to take a look at what you meant. I did not intend to disparage the president or the secretary of defense."" On March 23, Cornyn again made this claim, saying Jackson ""accused (Bush and Rumsfeld) of war crimes. Now, I don’t understand the difference between calling somebody a ‘war criminal’ and accusing them of war crimes."" Cornyn based his claim on habeas petitions from 2005, which Jackson co-filed on behalf of people detained at Guantanamo Bay, the New York Times reported. A habeas petition refers to civil action against an agent that holds a defendant in custody. The petitions named as respondents Bush and Rumsfeld, in their official capacities, and two Guantanamo Bay officials. The Times said they were ""essentially boilerplate habeas corpus petitions"" that allege the U.S. government had tortured the detainees. The petition filed on behalf of Khiali-Gul, for example, reads: ""By the actions described above, Respondents’ acts directing, ordering, confirming, ratifying, and/or conspiring to bring about the torture and other inhumane treatment of Petitioner Khiali-Gul constitute war crimes and/or crimes against humanity"" in violation of the Geneva Conventions. The petition alleged that ""severe physical and psychological abuse and agony"" were intentionally inflicted on Khiali-Gul in an effort to coerce him into providing information or confessions. It said that he had been severely beaten, interrogated while chained in painful positions, exposed to extreme temperatures, held in isolation for prolonged periods of time and deprived of adequate medical care, among other things.  Drew Brandewie, a spokesperson for Cornyn, said, ""If someone is being accused of war crimes, then they are implicitly being accused of being a war criminal."" He also emphasized the number of petitions: ""This wasn’t a one-off, random instance. It was deliberate, multiple times."" But legal experts told PolitiFact that simply filing a brief that alleges a respondent’s actions ""constitute war crimes"" is not tantamount to calling a person a war criminal. Victor Romero, a professor at Penn State Law, said it wasn’t fair to claim that arguments made on behalf of a client are equivalent to a lawyer making a direct accusation.  ""To do so would fundamentally misunderstand the lawyer’s professional role to be a zealous advocate by mistaking such arguments as the equivalent of that person’s private opinion,"" he said. This is especially true in the case of a habeas petition. Bush and Rumsfeld were named ""because they had ultimate control over Judge Jackson’s client’s liberty,"" said Jonathan Hafetz, a professor at Seton Hall Law School. The petition’s purpose was to ""determine the legality of her client’s detention."" The petitions were ""essentially a template"" and identical language was used by other lawyers in different detainee petitions, according to a New York Times report. ""It is important for a defense attorney to zealously raise all possible defenses,"" said Leila Sadat, a law professor at Washington University and senior research scholar at Yale Law School.  Asked to address Cornyn’s claims, Jackson said public defenders don’t choose their clients but must ""provide vigorous advocacy."" With regards to the petitions filed, she said: ""We were assigned as public defenders, we had very little information because of the confidentiality or classified nature of a lot of the record and as an appellate lawyer it was my obligation to file habeas petitions on behalf of my clients."" Stephen Vladeck, the Charles Alan Wright Chair in Federal Courts at the University of Texas School of Law, said in a series of tweets that the implication that Jackson specifically called Bush and Rumsfeld war criminals was, ""at the very least, misleading.""  The filings had to name Bush and Rumsfeld for procedural reasons, Vladeck said, and the respondents named in the petitions ""automatically changed"" when President Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009.  And when President Obama came to office on January 20, 2009, the captions automatically changed, so that they became [Detainee] v. Obama instead of [Detainee] v. Bush — reinforcing the point that naming these defendants officially is not a claim about their personal conduct. Brandewie, Cornyn’s spokesperson, said that even if Jackson was ""required"" to name Bush and Rumsfeld, that ""doesn’t negate her accusation or somehow make it not count. It’s context, maybe, but it doesn’t devalue the meaning of what she wrote in the petition.""  Penn State’s Romero countered that alleging a law has been violated is ""not the same as a court declaring after a trial that one is a ‘war criminal.’"" ""No reasonable person would mistake an attorney’s claim made in the service of their client with their personal opinion about the criminality of an individual,"" he said.  Cornyn claimed Jackson referred to former President George W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as ""war criminals in a legal filing.""  Jackson co-filed habeas petitions that alleged Bush and Rumsfeld had mistreated and tortured Guantanamo Bay detainees in ways that ""constitute war crimes."" But the filings did not call either man a ""war criminal.""  Experts said that, as a defense lawyer, Jackson was obligated to raise all possible defenses on behalf of her clients. In addition, they said it is unfair to claim that arguments a lawyer has made on behalf of a client are equivalent to that lawyer making direct accusations of criminality.  Cornyn’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context.

No, study doesn’t prove Moderna ‘created’ COVID-19
","As Russia’s war in Ukraine captures headlines, one anti-vaccine website is seeking to turn reader attention back to an unproven claim about COVID-19’s origins. ""Whilst you were distracted by the Battle for Ukraine, documents were published confirming Moderna created the COVID-19 Virus,"" read a March 14 headline on a story published on The Expose, a British website that describes itself as ""run by extremely ordinary, hardworking people who are sick and tired of the fear-mongering, lies and propaganda perpetuated by the mainstream media."" Beneath the headline, the story — which carried the anonymous byline of ""a concerned reader"" — alleged that new evidence ""​​proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the COVID-19 virus was created by the very pharmaceutical giant that has made billions"" from a vaccine. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because it drew a sweeping — and false — conclusion from a recent scientific paper that the lead author of the study itself said he can’t endorse. The Expose’s story refers to a Feb. 23 article in the Daily Mail regarding a recent scientific paper published in Frontiers in Virology. The Daily Mail said it stoked ""fresh suspicion that Covid may have been tinkered with in a lab."" Both the Daily Mail and The Expose stories said the paper’s authors discovered a portion of genetic code found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is a match for a part of code found in a gene sequence vaccine-maker Moderna filed a patent for in 2016 for cancer research — three years before the virus was discovered. According to The Expose, the likelihood of that match is so rare that it amounts to smoking gun evidence that Moderna created the virus that causes COVID-19. ""They calculated that the chances of a 19 nucleotide sequence patented by Moderna randomly appearing in Covid-19 in circumstances where it does not appear anywhere else in nature are 1 in 3 trillion,"" The Expose wrote. (Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of nucleic acids, like DNA and RNA.) The Expose goes on to conclude that Moderna released SARS-CoV-2 ""in order to sell their vaccines and to destroy the immune systems of their customers because our immune systems reduce their profits."" We reached out to Moderna for comment about the claim but did not receive a response. The actual study at the center of The Expose’s claim was published Feb. 21 and authored by seven researchers working at institutions across the globe, including University of Oregon, University of Padova in Italy, University of Michigan and University of South Florida, as well as Pan Therapeutics, a for-profit company in Switzerland that develops anti-cancer drugs. The paper’s authors wrote that during a search of an online database known as BLAST for a 12-nucleotide sequence found in the COVID-19 spike protein, they discovered a 19-nucleotide sequence they said was an exact reverse match found in the Moderna-patented gene sequence. They wrote that such a finding ""may occur randomly but other possibilities must be considered."" BLAST, or Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, is an online tool from the National Library of Medicine that lets users compare ""nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases.""  The paper’s authors said the matching code sequence was found in the virus’ furin cleavage site, one of the three main regions of the coronavirus, and one that researchers believe plays a key role in enabling the virus to penetrate deeply into a person’s lungs and cause serious illness. Dr. Bala Ambati, an ophthalmologist and a research professor at the University of Oregon, was first author on the study. He told PolitiFact that the peer-reviewed article was ""published as a perspective, the main purpose of which was to stimulate discussion."" ""We understood from the beginning that this match could be random chance and stated this in the article very prominently,"" he said. Asked whether the study proves the article’s claim that it was definitive proof that ""Moderna created the COVID-19 virus,"" Ambati said the researchers’ only goal is further study. ""We are not casting aspersions on any person, company, or country. We do not control social media and therefore can't respond to it,"" he said. Referencing statements by scientists who responded to the Frontiers in Virology study, Health Feedback fact-checkers noted that the matching code sequence ""isn’t unique"" to the gene patented by Moderna and also ""can occur in nature."" The same sequence was found in some chimney swifts and some bacterium, the scientists showed. The Daily Mail article itself quoted two critics. Lawrence Young, a virologist from Warwick University, told the Mail described the study’s finding as a ""quirky observation"" but not a ""smoking gun."" Simon Clarke, a microbiologist from Reading University, said that the match was ""surely entirely coincidental."" Experts we spoke with agreed. ""It’s an interesting coincidence, but nothing so amazing that it’s slam dunk evidence of much of anything, much less that Moderna somehow predicted COVID-19 and patented the sequence,"" said Dr. David Gorski, an oncologist and managing editor of the website Science-based Medicine, told PolitiFact.  Gorski said the 12-nucleotide sequence the study’s authors searched for isn’t very large. ""One would expect, by random chance alone, lots of matches doing a BLAST search,"" he said.  Gorski wrote more in depth about the topic here. Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, whose lab studies coronavirus infections, said the claim is not supported ""by any believable data."" The question of COVID-19’s origin continues to be a matter of discussion and ongoing research. In 2021, PolitiFact found that scientists had generally concluded that the virus resembles naturally occurring viruses. They were also paying attention, though, to the theory that it somehow leaked from a research lab in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization in 2021 established the WHO Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins on Novel Pathogens to evaluate and advise the organization about studies into the origin of COVID-19 and other pathogens. It’s expected to release a report soon about which studies are urgently needed, a WHO epidemiologist told Nature.  And President Joe Biden in August 2021 said the U.S. would continue to work with the WHO in that investigation. In February, scientists released two studies that again pointed to a large food and animal market in Wuhan as the likely source of COVID-19, a development that received wide coverage. Ambati said there are reasonable hypotheses about the origin of COVID-19 either being from a lab leak or from natural sources, but said most of them ""are not prospectively testable."" ""We want to stimulate discussion amongst all concerned on both ‘sides’ of the issue to try to produce prospective experiments that can prove or disprove their hypotheses. That is the major purpose of our perspective paper,"" Ambati said. An article claims that a recent study that found a matching stretch of code in the COVID-19 virus and a synthetic gene sequence patented by Moderna is proof that ""Moderna created the COVID-19 virus.""  There was a matching 19-nucleotide sequence found, but experts described it as likely coincidental and not definitive evidence of a lab leak or a creation by Moderna. The study’s authors did not say it proved anything, but rather they hoped their hypothesis would provoke further discussion and experiments. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C14B900>],/factchecks/2022/mar/24/blog-posting/no-study-doesnt-prove-moderna-created-covid-19/

Comparing news coverage of confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson and Brett Kavanaugh
","On March 23, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson sat before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for the third day of her confirmation hearing for a spot on the U.S. Supreme Court.  Jackson’s historic nomination and aggressive questioning by Republican senators dominated the week’s news headlines. But some social media users suggested that news networks’ coverage of the hearing revealed liberal biases.  ""Remember during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings when literally every network was covering it live? Where’s that with Jackson? Once AGAIN, more PROOF that the MSM are covering for pedos,"" one March 22 Facebook post says, alluding to criticism from Republican lawmakers who say Jackson was too lenient when sentencing people convicted of possession of child pornography. PolitiFact found that Jackson’s approach to sentencing in child pornography cases did not significantly differ from that of other judges.   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, let’s look at coverage of Jackson’s hearing.  We looked at the websites of several news outlets after the hearing got underway on March 23. NBC News, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, PBS NewsHour, NPR and One America News Network all had live coverage of the hearing. NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, PBS, and NPR were all streaming the hearing live on their sites. There were news stories on all the sites, and many had live analysis of the hearing.  The television broadcasts were less consistent. PolitiFact reporters in different states flipped through the channels on their TVs and found that MSNBC and OAN were airing the hearing live. CNN discussed the hearing among other news, such as about refugees fleeing war in Ukraine. Local news channels in at least two states — affiliates of NBC, ABC and CBS — were carrying regular programming, such as ""The View"" on ABC and ""The Price is Right"" on CBS.  Without the benefit of a time machine, we don’t know what we would find flipping through television channels on Sept. 6, 2018, day three of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. But online news coverage from that day is similar to how outlets have reported on Jackson’s hearing. And transcripts for programming that aired on CNN that day show that while the network aired some of the hearing and discussed it, it broke away for other news, such as an investigation into an active shooter in Cincinnati and coverage of social media company leaders testifying before lawmakers.  It’s important to remember that Kavanaugh’s hearing happened in two rounds. The first occurred Sept. 4-7, 2018, when he appeared before the Judiciary Committee and answered lawmakers' questions about his judicial record and beliefs.  This was before Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh became public. Here’s what happened next:  On Sept. 13, the New York Times reported that U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., had referred a matter concerning Kavanaugh to federal investigators. She didn’t say what it was about, but two officials ""familiar with the matter"" told the Times the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and a woman when they were in high school. A few days later, Ford revealed her identity in an interview with the Washington Post, and two other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. On Sept. 17, Ford and Kavanaugh agreed to testify before the Judiciary Committee. That testimony happened on Sept. 27, and Kavanaugh vigorously denied the assault allegation.  It’s perhaps this exceptional day of the confirmation hearing that people remember in contrast to Jackson’s confirmation hearing. ABC, CBS and NBC skipped their usual daytime TV lineups to air the hearing live, Variety reported at the time.  ""Every major broadcast and cable network suspended regular programming to carry gavel-to-gavel coverage,"" the New York Times also reported. But comparing Jackson’s hearing to this day of Kavanaugh’s is not apples-to-apples. It was not scheduled or anticipated until revelations of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, and it dealt wholly with those allegations as opposed to the questions of jurisprudence that came up during the original hearing dates.  Senators confirmed Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination on Oct. 6, 2018. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Jackson's nomination on April 4; that’s followed by a vote from the full Senate.  We didn’t find evidence that coverage of Jackson’s hearing is wildly out of step with coverage of the usual days of Kavanaugh’s hearing, and it’s not true that no news networks are covering her hearing live.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F84C40>],/factchecks/2022/mar/24/facebook-posts/comparing-news-coverage-confirmation-hearings-keta/

No, Virginia Tech swimmer did not tweet that her ‘finals spot was stolen’ by transgender athlete
","An imposter Twitter account claiming to belong to Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy purported to show Gyorgy tweeting that her ""finals spot was stolen"" in a race won by Lia Thomas, who became the first transgender woman to win an NCAA swimming tournament. ""My finals spot was stolen by Lia Thomas, who is a biological male,"" said the March 20 tweet, posted by a hoax account named @RekaGyorgy_. ""Until we all refuse to compete nothing will change. Thanks for all the support retweets and follows I wont stop fighting.""  Before the account’s suspension, the tweet was retweeted tens of thousands of times, including by Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender woman, who wrote, ""This is not OK on any level."" Screenshots of the tweet took off on Facebook and Instagram, racking up nearly 450,000 interactions in a matter of days, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. The screenshots were shared by prominent right-wing media organizations such as Breitbart News and the Blaze, conservative commentators like talk radio show host Ben Ferguson, and Republican politicians, including Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.  A tweet from an imposter Twitter account was shared by conservative media, commentators and politicians. But the viral tweet did not come from Gyorgy, and the @RekaGyorgy_ account does not belong to her. ""I don't have a Twitter account,"" Gyorgy told PolitiFact in a message sent via LinkedIn. Others involved with Virginia Tech’s athletics confirmed the same.  Sergio Lopez Miro, the director and head coach of Virginia Tech’s swimming and diving team, said the account was ""fake"" and did not belong to Gyorgy. He said he reported it to Twitter. Twitter permanently suspended the account for violating its policy against platform manipulation and spam, and specifically its rules against the creation of fake accounts, a spokesperson said. The hoax Twitter account joined the platform in November 2021. It had posted only one tweet and a handful of retweets of conservative politicians and a Daily Caller reporter, according to the Internet Archive.  The imposter account was originally listed under the Twitter handle @amanda191923 before changing to @RekaGyorgy_, Reuters and the Associated Press reported. Gyorgy did publicly criticize the NCAA over its rules allowing Thomas’ participation. In February, USA Swimming announced a policy that would require transgender athletes to lower their testosterone levels for three years before competing. The new rule would have excluded Thomas from competition, but the NCAA opted not to adopt it mid-season, thereby allowing her to compete in the collegiate championships, according to the New York Times. Gyorgy, who swam for Hungary in the 2016 Olympics and finished No. 17 in the women’s 500-yard freestyle race Thomas won, penned a letter of complaint to the NCAA on March 20. Finishing outside of the top 16 meant she missed the cut to advance to the finals. ""I respect and fully stand with Lia Thomas; I am convinced that she is no different than me or any other D1 swimmer who has woken up at 5am her entire life for morning practice,"" Gyorgy wrote in the letter. ""On the other hand, I would like to critique the NCAA rules that allow her to compete against us, who are biologically women. I’m writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future."" She continued:  ""This is my last college meet ever and I feel frustrated. It feels like that final spot was taken away from me because of the NCAA’s decision to let someone who is not a biological female compete. I know you could say I had the opportunity to swim faster and make the top 16, but this situation makes it a bit different and I can’t help but be angry or sad … Every event that transgender athletes competed in was one spot taken away from biological females throughout the meet."" Social media posts claimed that Virginia Tech swimmer Reka Gyorgy tweeted, ""My finals spot was stolen by Lia Thomas, who is a biological male.""  The tweet came from an imposter Twitter account that has since been banned for violating the platform’s policies against the creation of fake accounts, a fact that was confirmed by Gyorgy as well as Virginia Tech’s swimming coach and athletics department.  Gyorgy did write a letter to the NCAA over the issue, but she didn't use those words.

Josh Hawley misleads on Judge Jackson and child pornography sentencing
","On Day One of the U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., accused her in an op-ed of having a ""pattern of going soft on child pornography offenders.""  ""In fact, in every case for which I can find records and Judge Jackson had discretion, she gave child porn offenders sentences below the guidelines and below what the prosecutors were requesting,"" Hawley wrote. ""This isn’t a one-off. It’s a pattern."" During the hearing, Hawley listed seven specific sentences Jackson had handed down. ""In every case of these seven, Judge Jackson handed down a lenient sentence which was below what the federal guidelines recommended and below what prosecutors requested,"" Hawley said March 21. The next day, other Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, pressed Jackson on the same point. Cruz focused on the victims of child porn. ""Do you believe the voice of the children is heard when your sentences for those who are in possession of child pornography are far below what the prosecutors are asking for?"" Cruz asked March 22. For Hawley, Cruz and Lee, the gap between what prosecutors were seeking and the sentences Jackson handed down is proof of her leniency. It’s not the revealing yardstick they make it out to be. Judges regularly give lesser sentences than what the government wants, and that’s particularly true for child pornography offenses.  Sentencing guidelines have been around since Congress introduced them in the mid-1980s. For lawmakers, they were a way to take discretion away from judges and make sure that federal offenders paid the full price for their crimes. Instead of judges meting out justice as they saw fit, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent agency created by Congress, would give them a table to match each crime and situation to a prison sentence.  In 2003, Congress passed the PROTECT Act to crack down on crimes against children. Penalties for child pornography went up. Within the decade, the system showed signs of strain.  ""Despite strong congressional belief, a growing number of federal judges instead view most offenders who possess or trade child pornography as mostly harmless to others,"" wrote University of Texas law professor Melissa Hamilton in 2010. The guidelines were written before the internet made widespread sharing of images and videos possible. Penalties under the guidelines increase based on the number of images, and more and more offenders have been subject to those longer sentences. Judges and prosecutors make a distinction between people who exchange child pornography, and those who produce it. Because to produce it means someone personally committed child abuse. In contrast, having the pornography can take place without having direct contact with the children depicted. In 2012, the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that two-thirds of the sentences in non-production cases were shorter than the sentencing guidelines. (A 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision made the guidelines advisory, not mandatory.) That trend continued. In 2021, a follow-up U.S. Sentencing Commission analysis of non-production crimes found that if anything, the disparity between the guidelines and actual sentences had become more frequent. ""As the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s data shows, judges across the country routinely impose sentences far below what the guidelines recommend,"" said University of North Carolina law professor Carissa Byrne Hessick.   Hessick said that in her view, Jackson is no more lenient than the average federal judge. Hawley documented the number of times that Jackson issued sentences shorter than the guidelines. But he left out that sometimes, prosecutors also recommend shorter prison terms. Analyzing data from 2019, the U.S. Sentencing Commission said government recommendations went below the guidelines about 20% of the time. That’s about how often the pattern showed up in Hawley’s examples of Jackson’s cases. The seven cases Hawley mentioned generally involved non-production child pornography crimes, although one included a man who, in addition to possessing pornography, made plans to have sex with a minor. Among those cases, in two instances, prosecutors sought sentences below the guidelines. In one, the guideline minimum was 97 months and prosecutors suggested 24 months. Jackson gave three months. In the other, the guideline minimum was 151 months, and prosecutors asked for 72 months. Jackson gave 60. In four cases, prosecutors recommended the low-end of the guideline range, and in one, they sought a sentence three months above the minimum. Jackson’s sentences in those five cases were below the guidelines and below the prosecutors’ recommendations. But this list is not the full story.  Hawley omitted two additional cases where the charge was having or sharing child pornography. In one, prosecutors filed no recommendation at all, and in the other, they suggested a sentence that was more than 50% below the minimum suggested by the guidelines. To sum it up, out of nine cases — all but one involving possession or distribution of child pornography — prosecutors in Jackson’s courtroom were mum or went below the guidelines four times. In five cases, they opted for a sentence equal to or three months above the low-end of the guidelines. It bears noting that for more severe cases that combined possession of child pornography with attemped or actual sexual abuse of a minor, Jackson generally accepted the prosecution’s recommendation. In one instance, she handed down a sentence that was eight years longer than what the guidelines recommended. We contacted Hawley’s office and his staff referred us to comments he or his office had made to the press and reiterated the information Hawley presented during the hearings.  Hawley, and Cruz, emphasized how much shorter Jackson’s sentences were than what prosecutors sought. She appears to have company, including among judges elevated to federal appeals courts during the Trump administration. Ralph Erickson was confirmed to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in 2017. During his time as a District Court judge, Erickson handed down child pornography sentences less than the prosecution requested eight times between 2014 and 2015. Joseph Bianco joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2019. He sentenced child pornography offenders to less than what the prosecution wanted three times between 2011 and 2018. For Ohio State University law professor Douglas Berman, this is no surprise. Prosecutors, he said, often go high in their sentencing recommendation, not because they expect to get it, but as a way to frame the judge’s decision. ""Prosecutors know going in that the defense will ask for the lowest plausible sentence,"" Berman said. ""They then ask for the highest sentence that they think is appropriate. They want to signal to the judge the parameters of what a reasonable range is."" Berman added that the focus on prison time is just one part of the overall punishment. Jackson included long periods of supervised release, generally for 10 years after serving time, and in one case for 20 years. Berman said it’s an underappreciated component of sentencing. ""You can’t go to certain parts of your community and you can’t travel without permission,"" Berman said. ""Someone is monitoring your computer 24/7. These are very strong restrictions on your liberty."" Hawley said Jackson ""gave child porn offenders sentences below the guidelines and below what the prosecutors were requesting"" showing she is ""soft on child pornography offenders."" Hawley’s claim has an element of truth: Jackson’s sentences were below the guidelines and below the prosecutors’ recommendations. But Jackson’s approach to sentencing in child pornography cases did not significantly differ from that of other judges, data show. A comprehensive federal study found that for these crimes, sentences are shorter than what the guidelines suggest more than two-thirds of the time. Prosecutors sometimes recommend sentences below the guidelines, too. Hawley failed to prove that Jackson is any more lenient than federal judges on average. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E68100>],/factchecks/2022/mar/24/josh-hawley/josh-hawley-misleads-judge-jackson-and-child-porno/

Fact-checking false claims that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine labels hid safety information
","Misinterpretations of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events have been a common source of misinformation throughout the pandemic. Now, some social media users are homing in on a list of adverse events mentioned in a Pfizer vaccine safety report to create another false narrative. ""It's quite revolting to think that the inserts for these vaccines were blank when they should have contained all these diseases and adverse events,"" said one video posted on BitChute, a video-hosting platform. ""You really have to go through this yourselves, but this is really the bombshell news of the day, of the week, of the year."" A since-removed Instagram post similarly scrolled through the 9-page list of adverse events at the end of Pfizer’s document. The post was captioned: ""They knew all along. The CDC ACIP had these documents and STILL voted to give to children. These people are pure evil."" The social media posts also gave the impression that the adverse events were nefariously hidden from the public in a confidential report. These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). The adverse events listed on the Pfizer report aren't necessarily caused by vaccines. And the vast majority of those events may not have happened to any vaccine recipients at all. The document is marked confidential because it contained privileged commercial or financial information, not because it was trying to hide safety data. Adverse events are any and all health issues that arise after someone receives a drug, whether or not it's caused by the drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines an adverse event as ""any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any judgment about causality."" Reports of adverse events are collected while a drug is undergoing clinical trials and after it has been released to the general public. Documentation of adverse events aren't restricted to just healthcare providers and researchers — anyone can submit a report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the federal vaccine adverse event tracking system. VAERS accepts all reports and does not require proof that an event was caused by the vaccine — only that it occurred sometime after administration.  Not all adverse events that have been reported are included in a drug label because investigation may show they are not related to the drug. When an adverse event has been evaluated to be likely caused by the drug, however, it is then considered an adverse reaction. These are added to drug package inserts along with other safety information and proper usage guidelines. The Pfizer document that’s the source of these social media posts is an analysis of adverse event reports collected from December 2020 through the end of February 2021. During this period, the company’s COVID-19 was under emergency use authorization. Contrary to the assertions of many social media posts, the alphabetized list of adverse events at the end of the Pfizer report is neither a comprehensive catalog of conditions that have been reported as adverse events, nor a running log of diseases and side effects caused by vaccination. The 9-page appendix in the Pfizer report lists adverse events of special interest – pre-specified conditions the FDA asks researchers and drug companies to monitor for in relation to a drug. Inclusion in this list does not mean that the condition has actually been observed post-vaccination. The bulk of the document that appears before the appendix, on the other hand, consists of adverse events that patients or others reported having occurred following vaccination. Pfizer submitted this information to the FDA as part of its application for the vaccine’s full approval for people age 16 and older. These adverse events come from a variety of sources, including reports directly sent to the company, health authorities, cases in medical research, and both non-interventional and clinical studies. All adverse events were included regardless of whether or not they were related to the vaccine. The Pfizer report also explicitly notes the limitations of adverse event reporting, stating that all reports are voluntarily submitted, and inclusion does not necessarily indicate causality. Pfizer’s document is dated April 2021, and the FDA recently released it in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency, a group that says its aim is to ""obtain and disseminate the data relied upon by the FDA to license COVID-19 vaccines."" Among its members are a number of people who are known to have spread misinformation around COVID-19. The group posted the documents on its website, without any contextual information. Pfizer’s document does have a ""confidential"" label and says that: ""The information contained in this document is proprietary and confidential. Any disclosure, reproduction, distribution, or other dissemination of this information outside of Pfizer, its Affiliates, its Licensees, or Regulatory Agencies is strictly prohibited."" But a ""confidential"" label does not necessarily mean that Pfizer or the FDA were hiding crucial safety information from the public. By law, the FDA is prohibited from publicly disclosing the existence of new drug applications until they are approved. While this information can be made available by request, portions that fall under a FOIA exemption for trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential must be removed prior to release, as in the case of this document. Safety data for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been publicly available since 2020. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for both children and adults. Social media posts claim that the drug labels for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine ""were blank when they should have contained all these diseases and adverse events"" listed in a confidential report. In an application submitted to the FDA, Pfizer included a pre-specified list of ""special interest"" potential adverse events that the FDA asks researchers to look out for. The social media posts mischaracterized that list. The listing of those adverse events in this document does not mean that they actually occured in patients. Nor do the adverse events reported after receiving the company’s COVID-19 vaccine necessarily mean that the vaccine caused them. And the document is marked confidential not because the company was trying to conceal safety information, but because it contained privileged commercial or financial information. When an investigation determines that a specific adverse event was likely caused by a drug, it is then considered an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions are added to drug package inserts along with other safety information and proper usage guidelines. The social media posts fail to acknowledge these important caveats. We rate the posts False.

 Hunting Park: After $5M in fixes, is the area that much safer?
","As he asked Philadelphia City Council to consider a $300 million investment in the city’s parks and recreation centers, Mayor Jim Kenney told a success story. During his budget address in council chambers last week, the first-year mayor said that when the city and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, ""crime went down 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years."" That seemed like a huge drop in a high-crime area of the city, so we decided to check out the claim. The Kenney administration said it got the statistic from a Dickinson College study conducted in conjunction with Philadelphia Police and the Fairmount Park Conservancy, a nonprofit that leads capital projects and programming across 10,200 acres of Fairmount Park and 100 neighborhood parks throughout the city. Meg Holscher, the Conservancy’s senior director of development, said the 87-acre Hunting Park in North Philadelphia was identified in 2008 as an area of development because of how close it was to a high number of families. At the time, prostitution and drug trade were common in and around the park. After community meetings and input from neighbors, the Conservancy -- along with the Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation -- presented a master plan for the park in October 2009 that outlined two new playgrounds, a community garden and farmers market, new tennis courts and youth tennis programming, as well as a renovated football and soccer field. One of the most visible changes, though, was 64 lights placed around the park, which Holscher said residents wanted to curb illegal activity and violence. ""This project for us was a little bit of a game changer,"" she said. ""We’ve started to look at parks and how they are tied to healthy eating, healthy living and violence prevention."" Holscher said the $4.5 million Hunting Park capital projects and programming was funded through both public and private funds. In addition to that, another $500,000 was added through grants and corporate donations, bringing the total amount for phase one of the revitalization to some $5 million. After efforts to spruce up the park started in 2010, Conservancy staff started hearing from community members that it seemed like crime in the area had slowed, but an analysis wasn’t completed until 2014. That year, Amanda Vandenburg, then a researcher at Dickinson College in Carlisle, was interested in how parks influence communities. Vandenburg said she analyzed public data from the Philadelphia Police Department and charted crime statistics from 2006, before the revitalization efforts began, through 2013, when the first phase of the project had wrapped up. The data included both part I crimes (violent crimes like homicide, rape and aggravated assault) and part II crimes (like simple assault, prostitution, drug possession and other non-violent offenses.) She mapped instances of crime from inside and a half-mile buffer around the park, and found that there was a spike in crime between 2006 and 2007. After that point, crime began decreasing in 2008 citywide as police enforcement efforts in Philadelphia changed under a new mayoral administration. But crime continued to go down near Hunting Park. Between 2009 and 2013, ""there was an 89 percent drop in the number of crimes,"" according to Vandenburg’s study. Rape and theft from vehicle crime incidents increased over that time period, but other crimes decreased, including prostitution and drug use. Vandenburg also conducted a ""hot spot"" analysis that showed areas predicted to have the highest amounts of crime were closer to and in the park in 2009 and moved away from the park by 2013. While she said the revitalization of Hunting Park can’t be attributed as the only reason for a decrease in crime in the immediate area, the data does support the theory that illegal activity in the area decreased as the park was improved. Our Ruling Kenney used the efforts in Hunting Park as an example of why City Council should authorize more funds to revitalize parks and recreation centers throughout the city. He said ""when the city and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, crime went down 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years."" The Fairmount Park Conservancy confirmed that it -- along with the city and private donors -- invested about $5 million in revitalizing the park. Vandenburg, who conducted the study, said crime did in fact drop by 89 percent within a half-mile radius over the next three years. We rule the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809694E340>],/factchecks/2016/mar/10/jim-kenney/hunting-park-after-5m-fixes-area-much-safer/

Hillary Clinton wrongly says Bernie Sanders wants to delay the Clean Power Plan
","Debating in a city where rising sea levels are a concern, Hillary Clinton suggested Bernie Sanders wants to set back a major climate change policy of the Obama administration. ""The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense,"" Clinton said. ""What? Tsk,"" Sanders said, laughing and shaking his head incredulously. ""Wait, what?"" was our reaction too. Looking at statements and actions by Sanders, Clinton’s statement is misleading. Briefly, the Clean Power Plan aims to cut carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants by 2030 by 32 percent from 2005 levels, promoting clean(er) energy sources instead. This plan, hailed and criticized as a historic environmental initiative, was put on hold on Feb. 9, 2016, by the U.S. Supreme Court. We searched Google, LexisNexis and CQ for comments Sanders has made on the plan and found no evidence that Sanders has said he wants to delay the implementation. The Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders’ Feb. 21 interview with Grist, an environmental online magazine, in which he laid out what President Sanders would likely do on climate change. Sanders said he would change the Clean Power Plan to incentivize renewables instead of gas and extend a two-year program for wind and solar credits all the way to 2030. And beyond carbon, he would also regulate methane through the plan. The Clinton campaign also cited environmental law expert Richard Revesz’s blog post for The Hill criticizing Sanders. The Clean Power Plan ""cannot be changed at the stroke of the pen,"" Revesz wrote a few days after the Grist interview, and Sanders’ actions would ""stop the train and cause a great delay."" (Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor, made the same argument.) But Sanders himself did not say he would delay implementation. In reality, he wants a more ambitious plan (and has released one) and has supported Obama’s plan from the get-go. A day before it was unveiled, Sanders said in a press release, ""It sounds to me like a step forward in ending our dependence on fossil fuel, and I support that effort."" He also tweeted that day, ""Pres Obama knows climate change is the great planetary crisis facing us & we must move boldly to transform our energy system #CleanPowerPlan."" And in November, Sanders voted twice against legislation to block the Clean Power Plan. ""It is an embarrassment that with few exceptions Republicans refuse to recognize the reality of climate change, and even fewer are prepared to do anything about it,"" he wrote in a press release following the effort to repeal the plan. ""Today’s vote to block the Clean Power Plan is a stark reminder that instead of worrying about the future of our planet, Republicans are more concerned with their campaign contributions."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing."" Sanders advocates for more ambitious action on climate change, which some experts argue could delay the plan. But Sanders himself has never said what Clinton is suggesting, and he has supported the Clean Power Act in words and action.

Bernie Sanders' statistic on black, Hispanic unemployment has merit, but may be out of date
","During the Univision-Washington Post Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Bernie Sanders highlighted the bleak economic prospects of minority youths. ""One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country,"" Sanders said. ""If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent."" We checked a nearly identical statement by Sanders back in July 2015, when Sanders mentioned it at a campaign event in Portland, Maine. We rated it Mostly True. Now, eight months later, we’ll revisit it. We’ll start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isn’t identical but gives a quick approximation. For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate in February 2016 was 13.9 percent, for Hispanics it was 15.6 percent and for African-Americans it was 23.3 percent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said. So what’s going on? Sanders’ camp pointed us to research published in June 2015 by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. The numbers in the report match what Sanders said at the debate. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didn’t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were ""marginally attached to the labor force."" The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren’t entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of ""labor underutilization"" rather than ""unemployment."" EPI itself used the term ""underemployment"" in its research. At the Miami debate, Sanders described this statistic accurately, referring to individuals who are ""unemployed or underemployed."" So his statement has merit. However, the data is getting a little stale, and since the employment picture has generally been improving since the middle of last year, that’s a potential problem for the accuracy of Sanders’ statement. The last month analyzed in the EPI study was March 2015. We don’t know exactly how much improvement there’s been for young, minority, high school graduates since then, because that specific slice of the data isn’t readily available on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. But we can do a quick estimate based on the change in unemployment rates for 16-to-19-year-old Hispanics and African-Americans between March 2015 and February 2016. During that period -- since the EPI report came out -- the unemployment rate for young Hispanics fell from 20.9 percent to 15.6 percent, and for young African-Americans, it fell from 25.1 percent to 23.3 percent. In other words, it’s quite possible that the unemployment rates for young, minority, high-school grads is lower now than what Sanders stated. We should caution that the unemployment rate for subsets of the population, such as minority groups, tends to be volatile and has a larger margin of error than for the population as a whole. Still, the unemployment rates for these groups do seem to be lower in more recent months. During 2015, the black youth unemployment rate often reached or exceeded 30 percent, making the current rate of 23.3 percent particularly low -- the lowest since 2000, in fact. Similarly, in 2015, the Hispanic youth unemployment rate often reached or exceeded 20 percent, a level well above the current 15.6 percent rate. Our ruling Sanders said that ""if you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent."" As was the case when we first reviewed this claim last July, Sanders’ general point is correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do. But while Sanders had support for this data when he first began using these numbers eight months ago, there’s reason to believe that the improving job market has lowered these rates, at least somewhat. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C9AB80>],/factchecks/2016/mar/10/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-statistic-black-hispanic-unemployme/

Sanders said Clinton backed return for undocumented kids
","At the Democratic presidential debate at Miami Dade College, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders aimed to show that he, not former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is the better friend of undocumented immigrants. Sanders said that in Vermont, he backed state driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants. In New York, he said, Clinton opposed it. Sanders recalled the period in 2014 when tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors surged across the border. ""One of the great human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there's more violence than in any place in this country, and they came into this country,"" Sanders said. ""And I said welcome these children into this country. Secretary Clinton said, send them back."" Clinton said that wasn’t a fair summary.  The Sanders campaign said they got their information from an interview Clinton gave to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in June 2014. We looked at the full exchange about what the United States should do with the children. Amanpour: ""Should they be able to stay here? It's safer."" Clinton: ""Well -- it may be safer but that's not the answer. I do not -- "" Amanpour: ""Should they be sent back?""  Clinton: ""Well, first of all, we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide. We have children 5 and 6 years old who have come up from Central America. We need to do more to provide border security in southern Mexico.""  Amanpour: ""So, you're saying they should be sent back now?"" Clinton: ""Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families."" Clinton made a couple of points in that last answer. It is not as simple as saying ""send them back,"" but that was certainly an outcome she supported in some cases. To be precise, she said they should be sent back if the government can identify responsible adults to care for them. She allowed that it might not be possible to send all of them to their home country. But she indicated a preference. ""I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families,"" Clinton said. It should be noted that at the time, the administration actively pursued a policy to dissuade children and teenagers in Central America from attempting the trip in the first place. The government had open letters printed in local newspapers and paid for advertizing that dispelled any myth that these young people would be allowed to stay if they could get across the border. In July 2014, the White House signaled that it would seek funds to expedite the return of most of the children stopped at the American border. We sought comment from the Clinton campaign and had not heard back by the time we published. Our ruling Sanders said that when undocumented children were streaming across the border, Clinton said, send them back. That is a bit of an oversimplification. Clinton did not say they should be sent back no matter what. She set the condition that the government should first identify responsible adults to care for them. However, she expressed a preference that as many as possible be sent back. That message was part of the administration’s policy to discourage more young people from attempting the trip. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4724C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/10/bernie-sanders/sanders-said-clinton-backed-return-undocumented-ki/

Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants
","Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders attacked each other’s records on immigration during the Democratic debate in Miami. Clinton bashed Sanders for opposing a 2007 immigration bill. He fired back that she opposed driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants. ""Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do right thing and provide driver's licenses to those who are undocumented,"" Sanders said during the debate at Miami Dade College on March 9. ""She said ‘don’t do it’, and New York state still does not do it."" Did Clinton -- who has sought the Latino vote in Florida and elsewhere -- prevail upon Spitzer to not allow driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants in New York? Clinton on driver’s licenses in 2008 race In September 2007, Spitzer proposed giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Supporters said it would allow those who simply wanted to get to work to get ""out of the shadows,"" and get insurance while opponents saw it as a privilege for those who broke the law by illegally coming to the United States. ""I know exactly what Gov. Spitzer's trying to do, and it makes a lot of sense, because he's trying to get people out of the shadows,"" Clinton told the editorial board of the Nashua Telegraph in October 2007, according to an article in the New York Daily News at the time. ""He's trying to say, 'Okay, come forward, and we will give you this license.' "" During an Oct. 30, 2007, debate, co-moderator Tim Russert asked her about her comments and Spitzer’s plan. She gave a muddled answer in which she made a case for it and against it. ""You know, Tim, this is where everybody plays gotcha. It makes a lot of sense. What is the governor supposed to do? He is dealing with a serious problem. We have failed, and George Bush has failed. Do I think this is the best thing for any governor to do? No. But do I understand the sense of real desperation, trying to get a handle on this? Remember, in New York we want to know who's in New York. We want people to come out of the shadows. He's making an honest effort to do it. We should have passed immigration reform."" About two weeks later, Spitzer dropped his plan, saying it faced opposition. During the March 2016 debate, Sanders’ campaign sent a November 2007 New York Times story about a statement Clinton made saying she supported his decision to drop the plan. ""As president, I will not support drivers' licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration including border security and fixing our broken system."" Spitzer, who resigned in 2009 amid a prostitution scandal, talked about Clinton’s past statements on driver’s licenses in an interview he gave to David Axelrod in 2015. ""When Mr. Axelrod asked if the Clinton campaign had asked Mr. Spitzer to scrap the plan, he replied, ‘Yeah, we heard from folks who said they want this issue gone,’ "" the New York Times reported. Clinton on driver’s licenses in 2016 race But during the 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton changed her position. In April 2015, a Clinton spokeswoman told the Huffington Post: ""Hillary supports state policies to provide driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants."" Clinton herself addressed it during a town hall in February. ""Back then, it was a state-by-state determination, and I'm happy that most states have understood and moved in the right direction,"" she said. PolitiFact contacted spokespersons for Clinton’s campaign during the debate and asked if she had any evidence to refute Sanders’ claim and did not get a reply. In a conference call with reporters the day before the debate, Clinton surrogates didn’t answer questions about why she changed her position. ""Today our goal has moved well beyond driver's’ licenses,"" U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois said. ""We are talking about citizenship. As president she will fight for that."" Our ruling Sanders said that ""Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do right thing and provide driver's licenses to those who are undocumented. She said don’t do it, and New York state still does not do it."" Clinton waffled on driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants in a debate in October 2007. When Spitzer dropped his proposal, she came out with a statement supporting his decision to ax the plan to give the driver’s licenses. Sanders omitted that this occurred during her first presidential race and that during this campaign she has supported driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants.

Hillary Clinton said 'my predecessors did the same thing' with email
","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s decision to exclusively use private email to conduct State Department business was not unprecedented, she said at a Democratic debate in Miami. At the March 9 debate, Univision’s Jorge Ramos asked Clinton where she divined permission for her email setup and whether she had a different set of expectations for herself than she did for her employees. ""I’m going to give the same answer I’ve given for many months,"" Clinton replied. ""It wasn’t the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed, and as I’ve said and now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing, and many other people in the government."" There’s a couple problems with Clinton’s talking point that her State Department predecessors used email practices similar to hers. First of all, there’s the fact that most of Clinton’s predecessors did not regularly use email. Just four former secretaries of state have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she ""did not use email while she was in office"" from 1997 to 2001. And Rice, head of the State Department from 2005-09, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. So that leaves Powell, a regular email user, as Clinton’s only predecessor who serves as a useful comparison. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they pointed us to Powell. Like Clinton, Powell used a personal email address. However, there’s a big difference: Clinton hosted her email on a private server located in her home. Powell did not. Many politicians use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton used are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency, for a prior PolitiFact story. And there’s a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more elaborate setup. The Atlantic speculated the Clintons ""may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties — whether commercial, hacker, or government — were able to snoop on them."" The unorthodox approach has opened up questions about her system’s level of security. If the server was managed without the help of a third party, ""you would have to have a staff that’s keeping up with all the latest fixes,"" said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California’s Center for Computer System Security. We should note that the State Department has flagged a handful of emails containing information now deemed classified that were received by Powell and aides to Rice at private email addresses. In the more than 50,000 pages of Clinton emails the State Department has reviewed, just over 100 sent by Clinton have been deemed classified, according to a Washington Post analysis. It’s unclear whether the information was classified at the time the emails were sent. Our ruling Clinton said, regarding her State Department email practices, ""my predecessors did the same thing."" This is a misleading claim chiefly because only one prior secretary of state regularly used email, Colin Powell. Powell did use a personal email address for government business, however he did not use a private server kept at his home, as Clinton did. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E671C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-said-my-predecessors-did-same-thin/

Hedge fund-backed PAC attacks Clinton's Wall Street ties
","Before casting a ballot for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, voters deserve to know what she promised the bankers supporting her campaign, says conservative political action committee Future45. A 30-second Future45 television ad, which aired in the San Francisco region in February and March, opens with an actress portraying Clinton opening up a check from financial firm Goldman Sachs. ""Hillary Clinton gave speeches to the biggest banks on Wall Street after one of the worst financial crises in American history,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""But Hillary won’t tell us what she said to those banks who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her. So before you promise your vote to Hillary, don’t you deserve to know what she promised them?"" One of the most common critiques of Clinton is her connection to Wall Street — though usually from her Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders — so we decided to head to the Truth-O-Meter with the ad’s claim that Clinton gave speeches to banks ""who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her."" It’s worth noting that Future45 has taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals in the financial industry — including a $250,000 donation from Kenneth Griffin, CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and another $250,000 from Paul Singer, founder of hedge fund Elliott Associates. The PAC has spent more than $600,000 against Clinton so far this cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics’ OpenSecrets website.   Speaking fees Clinton has delivered several dozen paid speeches for various corporations, professional associations and financial institutions since she left the State Department in 2013, making upwards of $200,000 for nearly every appearance Based on records released by her campaign, we found that she made nearly $4 million speaking to financial services firms. She earned about half of that money speaking to big Wall Street banks like Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs, where she spoke three times in 2013, each appearance raking in $225,000. We don’t have many details regarding what Clinton talked about in those speeches. As the Future45 ad points out, she has declined to release transcripts until other candidates release transcripts from their own paid speeches. In any case, she has earned several million dollars in speaking fees from banks. Now on to her campaign contributions. Campaign contributions Clinton’s campaign and outside groups working on her behalf have received millions of dollars from Wall Street, $23.5 million to be exact, according to her OpenSecrets file. (If you’re browsing the file yourself, we combined donations from securities and investment with miscellaneous finance.) In total, almost $190 million has been raised to support her election, so the amount coming from the financial sector accounts for about 12 percent of all campaign and outside group funds.   Most of that money goes to outside groups working on Clinton’s behalf. The top-five organizations contributing to those groups are in the financial sector: Soros Fund Management ($7 million), Euclidian Capital ($3.5 million), Pritzker Group ($2.8 million), Paloma Partners ($2.5 million) and Saban Capital Group ($2.5 million). To be clear: The money doesn’t come from the firms themselves. Rather it comes from individual employees or members of the organizations, or the organizations’ political action committees. The Future45 ad, though, makes it seem like the big banks that paid Clinton for speeches are the same ones that are donating millions to elect her. Not so, at least not yet. OpenSecrets ran some numbers for us and found that donors from these five big Wall Street banks — Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs — have contributed a combined $628,435 to her campaign and allied outside groups so far. That’s far less than ""millions."" Clinton has received more money from the financial sector than any of the remaining candidates. Candidate Total money raised (campaign and outside groups) Total money raised from the financial sector Clinton $188,192,044 $23,550,697 Sanders $96,356,657 $125,665 Sen.

John Kasich $15,378,201 $2,367,417 In response to criticisms that she’s beholden to the big banks, Clinton has emphasized that she called for financial regulations early on in the financial crisis. She has also noted that other Democrats have received campaign donations from the financial sector, including President Barack Obama, who in 2008 set a record for most Wall Street donations. Our ruling An ad by conservative PAC Future45 said Clinton gave speeches to banks ""who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her."" Since 2013, Clinton has received about $4 million in speaking fees from the financial sector. And donors from the financial sector have contributed more than $23 million to her campaign and outside spending groups working on her behalf. However, the ad makes it seem like the same Wall Street banks that paid Clinton’s speaking fees are the same ones spending millions on her election, which is not the case. The major Wall Street banks where Clinton spoke have contributed in the hundreds of thousands, not millions. The statement is partially accurate, but it misconstrues some facts as well, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A458A40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/10/future45/conservative-pac-attacks-clintons-wall-street-ties/

John Kasich's tax cut largest in the nation? Depends
","The Ohio primary is a do-or-die moment for presidential hopeful John Kasich, which means it’s time for lots of new political ads. In this one, folksy music plays under a voiceover reminiscent of a Jeep commercial. ""Twenty million Americans are out of work. That’s unacceptable. But John Kasich won’t stop until that number is zero. As governor, Kasich delivered the largest tax cut in the nation, and over 400,000 new jobs have been created through his leadership. As president, Kasich will cut taxes, freeze new regulations and reshore American jobs. So punch the clock. Take that to the bank. America, let’s go to work."" Ohio is among the states that come up in discussions about big tax cuts. But was Kasich’s truly the largest in the nation? ""There are at least half a dozen reasons why there has to be an asterisk after that sentence,"" said Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank. ""The ones that come to mind are Kansas and Ohio, and to a lesser extent, North Carolina, Texas, maybe even Florida,"" said Davis. ""But it’s complicated, because tax changes are often enacted in stages, and in some cases are accompanied by tax hikes, like on cigarettes in Kansas and Ohio. Trying to gauge what the revenue of a state would have been without the tax cuts is really difficult."" Kasich’s spokesman, Rob Nichols, provided us with a table showing a summary of the governor’s net tax reductions from 2012 through 2017. It shows the net total reductions as $4.9 billion, which the campaign rounds up to $5 billion. Yet Kansas, not Ohio, consistently rises to the top of searches for ""largest tax cut."" A fellow with the Show-Me Institute, Andrew Wilson, called Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback’s tax reduction ""the biggest tax cut of any state, relative to the size of its economy, in recent history,"" in a June 2015 article in The Week. (The Show-Me Institute is a right-leaning think tank in Missouri.) Shawn Sullivan, the director of budget and business processes for the state of Kansas, provided data on Brownback’s tax cuts. The Kansas state budget office projects that between 2014, when Brownback’s tax cuts fully went into effect, and 2019, the cumulative tax reduction will be $3.9 billion. At face value, it would seem that Ohio’s tax cuts under Kasich, at $5 billion, are larger. But the major hurdle that makes the numbers difficult to get a handle on, Davis says, is consideration for population differences between states. Kansas and Ohio certainly aren’t apples-to-apples. The 2014 U.S. Census pegged Kansas’ population at 2.9 million. Ohio’s population in 2014 was 11.6 million -- nearly four times more people. Then there are those who argue that Kasich’s tax cuts weren’t really tax cuts.  A spokesperson with the Ohio Democratic party, Kirstin Alvanitakis, told us, ""We would argue very strongly that Kasich’s tax cut was actually more of a tax shift. The state’s cuts to local governments have resulted in local tax hikes."" The president of the Ohio Association of Professional Fire Fighters, Mark Sanders, likewise complained that fire and ambulance services statewide have had to ask voters to step up their local tax levels, as decreased revenue from state income taxes slashed budgets for emergency services between 2011 and 2013. Davis, with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said that by some estimates, Kansas’ tax cuts cost over $1 billion per year. ""If you adjust for population, that would certainly seem to exceed anything enacted in Ohio under Governor Kasich,"" Davis said. Kasich’s not-so-humblebrag about his tax cuts rings even less true considering that it was the Legislature that added in a tax cut larger than what Kasich’s 2015 plan originally proposed, by more than double. ""He did sign them,"" Davis concedes, ""but his original proposal would have been a lot smaller."" Our ruling The Kasich campaign ad says that ""as governor, Kasich delivered the largest tax cut in the nation."" The ad exaggerated in claiming that Ohio's tax cut topped every other state. While Ohio’s cuts are significant, when you factor in state population and economic size, Kansas’ reduction may be larger over time. Ohio’s shifting of the tax burden, from individual income tax to taxation on consumption, is what some consider more of a tax shift than a tax cut, and forces local governments to raise taxes in turn. Plus, the size of the tax cut wasn’t entirely Kasich’s idea, since it was the Legislature that made it bigger than he first proposed.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E4740>],/factchecks/2016/mar/10/john-kasich/john-kasichs-tax-cut-largest-nation/

Pro-Rubio super PAC ad tying Trump to KKK misses the mark
","Florida’s upcoming winner-take-all Republican primary is increasingly seen as the anti-Donald Trump faction’s last hope to stop the New York billionaire's march to the nomination. Numerous outside groups and super PACs are flooding the state’s airwaves with anti-Trump ads, including one tying him to the Ku Klux Klan. An ad from Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, includes clips of CNN’s Jake Tapper and Trump. Tapper: ""I asked Donald Trump three times if he would disavow the support of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan."" Trump: ""Well, I have to look at the group."" Narrator: ""Trump refuses to denounce the KKK. Think about that — for president?"" Because the ad has aired more than 430 times in Florida, according to Political TV Ad Archive, we thought it was worth taking a closer look. We gave the billionaire businessman a Pants on Fire rating for claiming to not to know anything about Duke. But it’s a stretch to say Trump ""refuses to denounce the KKK"" given his record of denouncements before and after the Tapper interview. The ad cites a Time article recapping Trump’s Feb. 28 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, where Trump dodged multiple questions from Tapper asking if he’d disavow the support of white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke (he would later blame a ""bad earpiece"" for his noncommittal answers). Trump’s history with Duke has been pretty well documented by PolitiFact and fellow fact-checkers at the Washington Post and Factcheck.org.  In a 1991 interview with CNN’s Larry King, Trump said he ""hated"" what Duke’s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented. King: ""Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him.""

Trump: ""I hate —""

King: ""Four hundred New Yorkers contributed.""

Trump: ""I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States.""

King: ""Anger?""

Trump: ""It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble."" In 2000, Trump declined to run a Reform Party presidential bid in part because the party attracted the support of Duke, a ""Klansman."" ""This is not company I wish to keep,"" he said at the time. Trump also called Duke ""a bigot, a racist, a problem,"" in a 2000 interview with NBC’s Matt Lauer. Although Trump disavowed Duke and the KKK in the past, his criticism has been less pointed in 2016. In August 2015, Trump answered a question by Bloomberg’s John Heilemann asking if he would repudiate David Duke’s supportive comments of Trump’s campaign by saying, ""I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repudiate."" The story popped up again after Buzzfeed reported on Feb. 25 that Duke was urging his supporters to vote for Trump, saying on his radio show that failure to do so would be ""treason to your heritage."" Asked about the endorsement the next day at a press conference, Trump said he wasn’t aware of it. ""I didn’t even know he endorsed me,"" he said. ""David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right. I disavow, okay?"" After the interview with Tapper, Trump rejected Duke’s support in interviews on Good Morning America and Morning Joe, calling him a ""bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years."" It’s worth noting that Duke, despite his support for white nationalism and former membership in neo-Nazi and openly racist groups, hasn’t been associated with the Klan for more than 40 years. Duke founded a Louisiana chapter of the racist group in 1974, but left the organization in 1980 because of its tendency towards violence and his inability to stop members of other chapters from doing ""stupid or violent things."" The modern-day Klan is a hodgepodge of dozens of independent chapters spread throughout the country with a total membership around 5,000, according to the Anti-Defamation League. There’s no central Klan organization that represents every chapter, but Arkansas-based Knights Party spokeswoman Rachel Pendergraft told Politico in December that Trump was a major talking point in the group’s recruitment efforts. Our ruling A pro-Rubio super PAC said, ""Trump refuses to denounce the KKK."" Trump hasn’t gone after the KKK and white nationalists like Duke with the same fervor as his opponents, but it’s inaccurate to make a blanket statement based on a single interview given his history of rejecting white supremacists.

Pro-Ted Cruz PAC wrongly says Donald Trump wants government-run health care
","In the days leading up to the South Carolina Republican primary, Palmetto State voters who tuned in to the game show Jeopardy or the evening news had a good chance of seeing an anti-Trump ad called ""Trumpcare."" It comes from Keep the Promise I, a political action committee that backs Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The ad, and others like it, weren’t enough to thwart Donald Trump, who took the state by a hefty 10-point margin. (Thanks to the Political TV Ad Archive, anyone can dip into the archive’s database to learn where and when it and dozens of other ads have run.) This ad makes the case that Trump supports a government-run health care program in which Washington pays for everybody. The last half is an edited version of an interview Trump did on CBS News’ 60 Minutes with Scott Pelley in September last year. Here’s the full text: Voiceover: ""First there was Hillarycare."" Clinton video clip: ""We have to get to universal health care."" Voiceover: ""Then there was Obamacare."" Obama video clip: ""Moves us in the direction of universal health care coverage in this country."" Voiceover: ""We can't afford TrumpCare."" Trump: ""Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say."" Pelley: ""Universal health care?"" Trump: ""I am going to take care of everybody."" Pelley: ""Who pays for it?"" Trump: ""The government's gonna pay for it."" Voiceover: ""Donald, don't you know Hillarycare, Obamacare and Trumpcare are all government-run health care?"" We compared the ad’s version of the 60 Minutes interview to the actual transcript and it’s clear that some artful editing took place. Here’s the complete segment on health care between Trump and Pelley on 60 Minutes. We bolded the words the ad kept in. Trump: ""Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced. Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what's going on with premiums where they're up 45, 50, 55 percent."" Pelley: ""How do you fix it?"" Trump: ""There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, ‘No, no, the lower 25 percent that can't afford private.’ But--"" Pelley: ""Universal health care?"" Trump: ""I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now."" Pelley: ""The uninsured person is going to be taken care of how?"" Trump: ""They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably--"" Pelley: ""Make a deal? Who pays for it?"" Trump: ""--the government's gonna pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything."" So now we can see what the ad left out. It left out Trump saying that he was talking about people of limited means, the lower 25 percent, who can't afford private insurance. It left out Trump saying that for the most part, he sees people picking the deal they like from competing private plans. By omitting those key phrases, the ad delivers the message that Trump backs government-sponsored health care for everyone. That said, Trump did lay out the goal of making sure that everyone got health care.  But using his rough percentages, the country would get there with about three-quarters of the public taking care of themselves. Given that one of the details of his health care proposal is to eliminate government regulations that prevent insurance companies from selling policies across state lines, to some degree, Trump advocates a smaller role for government, not a larger one. We reached out to the coordinator of the PAC that produced the ad and did not hear back. Lastly, as we've said many times, Obamacare is not government-run health care. Our ruling A pro-Cruz PAC, Keep the Promise I, ran an ad that appeared to have Trump saying he wanted the government to pay for everyone’s health care. That ad relied on very selective editing of an interview Trump had on CBS News. The edits left out very important words. Trump said most people would buy their insurance privately and that the government would help those of limited means, which he roughly described as the lower 25 percent. The ad omitted key details that would have conveyed a very different meaning. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E4F40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/09/keep-promise-1-pac/pro-cruz-pac-wrongly-says-trump-wants-government-r/

Wisconsin firm moving overseas 'begged taxpayers for a bailout' and got one, Hillary Clinton says
","Hillary Clinton stood outside of Johnson Controls Inc. when she cut a TV spot that attacks the suburban Milwaukee-based global firm.     ""This is Johnson Controls,"" Clinton says in the ad, which was posted to YouTube on Feb. 21, 2016. ""When the auto industry was going under, car parts companies like them begged taxpayers for a bailout and they got one."" Did the company beg for a bailout -- and get one? Yes. And no. Prior attack Clinton’s claim in the ad, which was aired in the Duluth TV market ahead of the March 1, 2016 presidential caucuses in Minnesota, might sound familiar. A couple weeks earlier, at a debate in New Hampshire with her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the former secretary of state said: ""We bailed out"" Johnson Controls Inc. when ""we saved the auto industry"" and ""now they want to avoid paying taxes."" The world's leading maker of car batteries, and a manufacturer of heating and cooling equipment and controls, was not a direct recipient of the federal bailouts of the auto industry. But Johnson Controls did push for the funds. And as Clinton indicated, the company has said it will save $150 million per year in taxes by moving its headquarters to Ireland. So we gave Clinton a Mostly True for her claim in the debate. But her claim in the TV ad isn’t as much on target. In 2008, of course, the entire auto industry was in very bad shape as the recession took hold. Layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track to reach 250,000 workers. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind.

That December, President George W. Bush used $17.6 billion in TARP money to keep GM and Chrysler afloat. And in 2009, President Barack Obama continued the rescue of the two automakers that was financed with about $80 billion in taxpayer money, about $70 billion of which was repaid. But Johnson Controls was in much better condition. It certainly would've taken a major financial hit had the automakers gone under. But it did not directly receive any bailout funds. (The bailout money went to General Motors Corp., Chrysler LLC and auto lending arms Ally Financial Inc. and Chrysler Financial.) Our rating In a TV ad, Clinton said: ""When the auto industry was going under, car parts companies like"" Johnson Controls ""begged taxpayers for a bailout, and they got one."" The company did push Congress to approve the 2008-’09 federal bailout of the auto makers. But it did not itself get a bailout.

John Kasich ad says 20 million Americans 'are out of work'
","For all the discussion of immigration, foreign policy and social issues in the 2016 campaign, one issue always returns to the fore eventually: jobs. Republican candidate John Kasich emphasizes his record on jobs as Ohio governor in a new ad. The ad begins with grainy footage of what seems to be an unemployment line. The narrator’s first words are, ""Twenty million Americans are out of work,"" and this assertion is bolstered by being repeated in on-screen text:  This figure sounded high to us, since the official number of unemployed Americans during the most recent month, February, tops out at about 7.8 million. So we asked the Kasich campaign for their evidence, and they proceeded to cite a source that caught us off-guard: Us. Specifically, they pointed to our fact-check from August in which we analyzed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump said that ""we have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed."" We rated this claim False, largely because the 93 million number included lots of people who would not be expected to want or be able to work, including full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen to take care of their children full-time. However, in the process, we conducted a mathematical experiment in which we played with possible numbers of Americans who are ""out of work"" that fit somewhere between the official unemployment rate (on the low end) and Trump’s number (on the high end). HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Here’s what we wrote, using the statistics that were current at the time: The official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it’s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it’s not unreasonable to include: • The 6.4 million people who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being ""in the labor force,"" but who say they ""currently want a job."" • And the 6.5 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job. This would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as ""out of work"" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that’s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Kasich, said the campaign simply updated our math with more recent data in preparing the television ad. The numbers for January 2016, Nichols said, were: • Unemployed: 7.8 million • People who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being ""in the labor force,"" but who say they ""currently want a job"": 6.2 million • People working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job: 6 million. That works out to 20 million on the nose. We salute the Kasich campaign’s efforts to fact-check-proof their assertion. Still, we should note that we didn’t intend our calculation to be the final word on how to determine the number of ""out of work"" Americans. Rather, we were trying to provide a benchmark for showing just how wrong Trump’s number was. We’ll note that our wording was that the 21 million figure had ""some justification"" — not exactly a clarion call for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to change its longstanding protocol. In subsequent fact-checks, though not the one the Kasich campaign referred to, we have added language that is clearer about our intentions. We did that, for instance, in our Feb. 11, 2016, fact-check of a different statement by Trump: ""Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35 (percent). In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent."" In that fact-check, which produced a rating of Pants on Fire, we prefaced a similar alternative calculation this way: ""We are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent."" But enough from us. What do the two economists we checked with for the original fact-check think about Kasich’s use of the 20 million figure? ""Given that the image looks like a guy in an unemployment line, I'd say it's a misleading figure,"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com. Many people have good reasons for not wanting to work now, she said, and that is something distinct from actually being ""out of work."" Burtless agreed, saying, ""The 5.988 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job are not ‘out of work.’ They are employed, but on a work schedule that does not provide them with the weekly hours they desire."" At the same time, Burtless said there is still some value in the number cited in Kasich’s advertisement. ""Gov. Kasich has given an upper-bound estimate of the total number of Americans who are unemployed or underemployed,"" Burtless said. It’s just not the only estimate. Our ruling Kasich’s ad said that ""20 million Americans are out of work."" The Kasich campaign shrewdly cites a past PolitiFact item as evidence for this larger-than-usual estimate of America’s ""out of work"" population. But it’s worth noting that the calculation we did was not intended to determine the actual number of out-of-work Americans, but rather to suggest the highest figure with any sort of credibility as a way of seeing how far out of line Trump’s assertion was. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AE4A00>],/factchecks/2016/mar/09/john-kasich/john-kasich-ad-says-20-million-americans-are-out-w/

Testing Tammy Baldwin claim on gun deaths, CDC research ban
","While Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin is not up for re-election until 2018, she’s still engaging in at least one of the biggest issues in the 2016 campaign. In January, she co-sponsored legislation to appropriate $10 million to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the next five years for firearm research. To promote her legislation, Baldwin tweeted this on Jan. 24, 2015, citing limits on what the CDC can do: ""Over 32,000 people die from #GunViolence every year. Yet, @CDCgov is banned from researching ways to prevent this."" We wondered if Baldwin was right. Gun violence numbers As backup for the statistic that 32,000 people die from gun violence every year, Baldwin’s team pointed to the CDC’s National Vital Statistics database. It’s the most comprehensive source for national statistics as it is a census, pulling information from death certificates.   The report shows that in 2013, the latest year for which data is available, there were 33,636 gun-related deaths. Beyond that, from 2009-2013, an average of 32,100 people died each year from gun-related injuries. So Baldwin is on target with the number. About one third of gun-related deaths are homicides, with suicides counting for about two thirds of deaths. PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton in October 2015: ""We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."" This claim was backed up by taking the number of firearm deaths tallied by the CDC in 2013 and averaging it out over a year. Clinton hit the number, but didn’t mention that most of those deaths are suicides, not homicides. Her claim was rated Mostly True. Dickey amendment In the second part of her claim, Baldwin said the CDC is ""banned from researching ways to prevent"" gun violence. Her tweet linked to a news release that pointed to a 1996 piece of legislation as evidence. The news release said, in part: ""Currently, a Republican appropriations rider from 1996 prohibits funding for such critical research at the CDC, even though the original rider’s author, former Republican Jay Dickey, has since announced his opposition to it noting that the rider’s intention was to prevent the CDC from lobbying for gun control, not from conducting gun-violence research.""   This 1996 rider is commonly called the Dickey Amendment. In the early 1990s, the New England Journal of Medicine published research that concluded gun ownership, independent of other factors, increased the risk for a homicide in the home. The study was funded by the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. In the wake of the research, and subsequent media attention, the National Rifle Association campaigned for the elimination of the injury prevention center. While the center survived, new language in the 1996 budget bill said that ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" In some ways the statement was redundant, as general funding cannot be used for advocacy. Congress also took from the CDC’s budget $2.6 million -- the exact amount invested in firearm injury research the previous year. While the language against advocating and promoting gun control did not explicitly ban the CDC from researching gun violence, the CDC stopped the work anyway. Linda Degutis, the former director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said the action by Congress sent a strong message to the CDC.   ""Even though that language doesn’t say research is prohibited,"" Degutis said, ""everyone who was making decisions interpreted it to mean that you could not do any research on gun violence.""   The language, and lack of funding, has carried on in spending bills and even been expanded to the National Institute of Health, another agency in the Department of Health and Human Services. ""It is the equivalent of a ban,"" said David Hemenway, director of the Injury Control Research Center at Harvard University. ""It’s a touch more nuanced than a ban, but there’s basically no real difference in terms of research."" In the wake of mass shootings in 2013, President Barack Obama requested the CDC be granted new funding to study gun violence. Congress did not appropriate the funds. Our rating Baldwin said ""over 32,000 people die from #GunViolence every year. Yet, @CDCgov is banned from researching ways to prevent this."" The most comprehensive data available supports the first part of the claim, that more than 32,000 people die from gun violence every year. On the research ban, while the language from the Dickey Amendment does not explicitly ban the agency from conducting research, its interpretation effectively banned the practice. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate Baldwin’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976AB800>],/factchecks/2016/mar/09/tammy-baldwin/testing-tammy-baldwin-claim-gun-deaths-cdc-researc/

Ted Cruz claim about Donald Trump praising Hillary Clinton overlooks Trump calling her 'worst' ever
","Just before Ted Cruz won the Republican presidential primaries in Texas and Oklahoma plus the GOP caucuses in Alaska, the Texas senator hammered Donald Trump as ill-equipped to face Democrat Hillary Clinton on the November 2016 ballot. On the Feb. 28, 2016, edition of CNN’s State of the Union, Cruz confirmed he personally will support whoever lands his party’s presidential nomination, ""period, the end."" ""But I will tell you this,"" Cruz said to host Jake Tapper. ""Listen, I think, if we nominate Donald, Hillary probably beats him. Not only does she get to attack him on a whole host of issues where he agrees with her, but… he's described Hillary Clinton as... one of the best secretaries of state in history."" Cruz leveled a similar claim during the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican presidential debate in Houston, saying: ""And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times…?"" We wondered. Did Trump truly rate Clinton’s performance as secretary of state among the best ever? In response to our request for backup, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a link to a Jan. 17, 2016, web post by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, presenting video of Trump saying on camera: ""And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else."" A portion of the same video earlier appeared in a January 2016 Cruz campaign video suggesting tight ties between Trump and Clinton. Web searches led us to the Trump clip, posted by someone on LiveLeak.com, a British video-sharing site, Dec. 8, 2015. Asked where the video originated, the same individual (with the screen name Exec) pointed us to video from an NBC News interview of Trump after the builder-developer gave an Iowa talk on politics in August 2013. NBC News headlined the interview by reporter Kasie Hunt: ""Trump: Clinton will have to defend record as secretary of state."" Our transcript of Trump talking to Hunt on Aug. 10 or 11, 2013, about Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton: ""Well first of all, I know her very well and I know her husband very well and I like them both. And they are, uh, you know, just really terrific people. I like them both very much. ""But I think you’ll be, you know, you’ll be looking at the record of Hillary Clinton. And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else. You’ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record. ""I don’t know that Benghazi, it doesn’t seem to have resonated like perhaps it should have. But many other things have come up and the world is in turmoil. And I think that a lot of people will be looking at Hillary’s record as secretary of state and she will be defending that record. And I’m sure she’ll do a good job of defending it. But that will be the thing they will be going for."" No doubt, Trump said: ""And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else."" That’s not explicitly best-in-history, but could be bandied in that way. Then again, it occurred to us, that comment could be taken as having a different scope; that is, Trump saying only that anyone appraising Clinton would focus on her record as secretary of state. (We encourage  you to watch for yourself.) Consider this change of punctuation: ""And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else."" Note too that Trump said next: ""You’ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record,"" a point he made several times in the interview. Trump praised Clinton in 2012-13 Web searches led us to other instances of Trump making positive comments about Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, which ran from the start of Barack Obama’s presidency in 2009 through January 2013. From a Trump-Greta Van Susteren exchange on the March 28, 2012 episode of ""On the Record,"" a Fox News program: VAN SUSTEREN: ""Looking at the administration, how do you think the vice president has done? (Joe) Biden, although, being a vice-president is not a job that is very visible, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I'm curious what you think about those two."" TRUMP: ""I think Biden has been a very loyal person, to be honest with you. I think he has been a good vice president for the agenda that they set and he has been a very, very loyal person. I respect him for that. ""Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard. And I think, again, she's given an agenda, it is not all of her, but I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. I like her."" VAN SUSTEREN: ""She says she's out at the end of this term. Do you think we will see her again running for office?"" TRUMP: ""I think so. Assuming she is healthy, I think she probably runs after the next four years, I would imagine."" VAN SUSTEREN: ""Do you support her?"" TRUMP: ""I don't want to get into this because I will get myself into trouble --"" VAN SUSTEREN: ""That's why I asked you."" TRUMP: ""I just like her. I like her husband. Her husband made a speech on Monday and was very well received. He is -- he is a really good guy, and she's a really good person and woman."" Also, a July 2012 MSNBC news story noted Trump’s statement in an October 2013 interview with Larry King about Hillary and Bill Clinton: ""I like them both very much."" (See Trump’s ""like"" about the 15:46 mark of the King interview posted here.) So, Trump in 2012 and 2013 indicated he personally liked Clinton and in 2012, when Clinton was still the secretary, Trump said she ""works hard and I think she does a good job."" Trump in 2015 But, unnoted by Cruz, Trump has most recently been critical of Clinton's work, calling her one of the country’s worst secretaries of state. On July 8, 2015, he sent a statement to the Business Insider calling Clinton ""the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States."" The publication said Trump issued his statement after Clinton told CNN she was disappointed in Trump’s campaign-opening remarks about Mexican immigrants. In his June 14, 2015, kickoff, Trump said: ""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Our ruling Cruz said Trump has ""described Hillary Clinton as one of the best secretaries of state in history."" To the contrary, Trump last year called Clinton the worst secretary of state in history and we didn't find any instance of Trump calling Clinton one of the best ever. Still, Trump previously said he liked Clinton and even that she was doing a good job as secretary -- while, in the 2013 NBC News interview, he said: ""And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else."" We see ambiguity in this phrasing, which could be taken as high praise or, more logically, as a clumsy rehash of Trump’s repeatedly expressed prediction in the interview that Clinton’s record would be a target of scrutiny. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Economy', 'California', 'Arnold Schwarzenegger']","
Did Arnold Schwarzenegger bend the truth with John Kasich claim?
","Hoping to add some political muscle to Republican John Kasich’s bid for the White House, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed the Ohio governor for president during a rally in Columbus this week. But did Schwarzenegger, a fellow Republican, bend the truth when he described Ohio’s financial turnaround under Kasich? In his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger called Kasich an ""action hero,"" saying that when Kasich became governor in 2011, ""there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there’s a $2 billion surplus.""  We decided to check that claim. Kasich has made similar statements throughout his campaign for president, and highlighted this fiscal transformation on his website. ""I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus,"" Kasich said during the Republican presidential debate in Cleveland last year. The national PolitiFact team took a deeper look at Kasich’s claim last August. It’s very similar to Schwarzenegger’s claim. Here’s what it found: An $8 billion hole? There’s an argument for $8 billion, but there’s also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011. The $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich’s budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with ""conceptually"" in a 2011 interview, though he took issue with some of the methodological details. Whatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this as a ""hole"" rather than a deficit. Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit. Schwarzenegger used the term ""deficit,"" which we interpreted as a minor misstatement rather than an attempt to deceive. A $2 billion surplus? This figure is clearer. Ohio’s Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state’s ""rainy day fund"" had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. The surplus remained above $2 billion this week, said a spokesman for the budget office. Does Kasich deserve credit? It’s not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state’s improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state’s fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature. Schwarzenegger’s claim strongly implies Kasich played a central role in the turnaround, though it doesn’t explicitly link the two together. But it’s important to remember that Kasich took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio’s. When Kasich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 percent -- exactly the same as the national rate. As of December, the national unemployment rate was 5 percent and the rate in Ohio was 4.8 percent. So Kasich’s timing has been fortunate. Our ruling In his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger said that when Kasich became governor, ""there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there’s a $2 billion surplus."" Kasich said, ""I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus."" It’s possible to argue over whether the starting point should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich and Schwarzenegger didn’t pull that figure out of thin air, though it certainly was high by historical standards. Kasich also used the term ""hole,"" which is more appropriate than ""deficit."" Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it’s worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that ""I"" did it, since the state’s fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery. The statements are accurate but need additional information, so we rate them Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D8D7C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/08/arnold-schwarzenegger/arnold-schwarzeneggers-claim-about-ohios-financial/
"['National', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says he consistently beats Donald Trump by bigger margins than Hillary Clinton does
","To potential supporters who worry about his viability as a general-election candidate, Bernie Sanders has often pointed to polls showing him doing better against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump than Sanders’ Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Sanders repeated this point during the Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., on March 6. ""I would love to run against Donald Trump, and I’ll tell you why,"" Sanders said. ""For a start, … not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump. …  And, that’s true nationally."" We decided to take a closer look at the national polling data and to check with polling experts to see whether head-to-head polls at this stage of the campaign are reliable.   Using the RealClearPolitics.com poll archive, we found seven national surveys since Jan. 1 that tested both Clinton and Sanders against Trump in a general-election contest. Here’s the rundown. For each poll, the candidate who runs stronger against Trump is listed in bold. Poll and date Clinton vs. Trump result Sanders vs. Trump result CNN/ORC, 2/24-2/27 Clinton +6 Sanders +12 Fox News, 2/15-2/17 Clinton +5 Sanders +15 Quinnipiac, 2/10-2/15 Clinton +1 Sanders +6 USA Today/Suffolk, 2/11-2/15 Trump +2 Trump +1 Public Policy Polling, 2/2-2/3 Clinton +7 Sanders +4 Quinnipiac, 2/2, 2/4 Clinton +5 Sanders +10 NBC-Wall St. Journal, 1/9-1/13 Clinton +10 Sanders +15 The chart shows that Sanders has a point. Of the seven polls in 2016 that tested both Democratic candidates, Sanders ran stronger against Trump in six of them. (In one case, the USA Today/Suffolk poll, Trump beat both, but beat Sanders by slightly less.) Case closed? Not quite, say polling experts. Clinton has been scrutinized and attacked as a public figure for a quarter century, but Sanders is a relatively new figure to voters nationally. So while a lot of voters’ minds are already made up about Clinton based on her long history in the public eye, it remains to be seen how open potential voters will be to supporting Sanders once Republicans start airing negative attacks, especially ones that note his identification as a democratic socialist. (We have previously reported that, according to polls, being a socialist is a less attractive quality for voters than being an atheist.) ""Very few Americans are making these comparisons yet, so opinion about these choices is likely to be weakly held, particularly for a large number of middle-of-the-road, independent, and disinterested Americans who are not participating in primaries and caucuses,"" said Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political scientist and a specialist in public opinion. Smith added that early polls do not weed out ""likely voters,"" as polls later in the campaign do. This could matter, given Sanders’ high rates of support among college students and younger voters, who have not yet demonstrated a long track record of voting. ""If Sanders draws disproportionately from people who are not likely to vote, which is a reasonable speculation at this point, then his support may be somewhat overstated in some comparisons,"" Smith said. (He added that the same high level of first-time or irregular voters applies to Trump, but this should be less of a factor for Clinton, whose supporters skew older and more experienced than Sanders’ do.) Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, agreed that ""national polls don’t have a great deal of predictive value this early in the campaign."" She pointed to research by Harry Enten, a polling analyst at the website fivethirtyeight.com. Enten found that since 1944, general election polls about a year before Election Day ""have only been weakly predictive of the eventual result."" He found that polls pitting the eventual Democratic and Republican nominees were, on average, off by more than 10 points from the eventual result. To cite just one example, Enten wrote that ""if you trusted the polls in late 1991, you might have thought Bill Clinton was finished in the 1992 presidential election. George H.W. Bush was ahead of Clinton by 21 percentage points at the time; Bush was basking in sky-high approval ratings after the first Gulf War. But as the Gulf War triumph faded and the economy became the focus of the campaign, Clinton would gain in the polls and eventually overtake Bush."" Our ruling Sanders said that ""almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump … and, that’s true nationally."" On the numbers, Sanders is right. He runs stronger against Trump than Clinton in six of the seven national head-to-head polls since Jan. 1. However, polling experts say such results should be taken with a grain of salt, since polls taken well before the start of the general-election contest have historically not been very accurate predictors of the November results.

Pro-Ted Cruz PAC says Marco Rubio skipped 18 defense votes including one to arm Kurds to fight ISIS
","Marco Rubio has been repeatedly attacked for missing Senate votes while campaigning for president. Now a PAC supporting Ted Cruz has zeroed in on particular missed votes that relate to defense spending. ""Did you know Marco Rubio skipped 18 defense votes, including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS?"" asks the narrator in an ad from Keep the Promise 1, a PAC largely funded by a New York hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer. Those are fighting words in an ongoing battle between Cruz, the Texas senator, and Rubio, the Florida senator, about defense votes. But is it accurate? Yes, Rubio skipped the votes. But this ad misleads by failing to tell the full picture. It doesn’t tell viewers that all of Rubio’s skipped votes pertain to one bill, and that Rubio voted for the overall bill, while Cruz actually voted against it. A spokeswoman said the PAC didn’t have a plan yet regarding where the ad will run, but Politico reported that it will air in Florida, where voting by mail and at early sites is already underway leading up to the March 15 primary. Defense votes The ad cites a Feb. 17 article in Breitbart, a conservative website, about Rubio skipping 18 defense votes in 2015. These votes relate to a single bill: the National Defense Authorization Act, which sets spending and policies for the Defense Department, for military construction and for security programs within the Energy Department. Eleven of the 18 skipped votes cited by Breitbart were on amendments before the bill passed. Other votes were procedural or largely after the Senate passed the bill, for example, working out differences between the two chambers or on the conference report before the bill went to President Barack Obama. Rubio’s skipped votes included amendments to revise the definition of spouse for veterans benefits, reaffirm the prohibition on torture and to improve cybersecurity. (Cruz himself skipped three of the 18 votes that Rubio missed.) The ad emphasized that one of Rubio’s missed votes was to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS. Two days before the Senate voted on the final bill, Rubio skipped a vote on an amendment to provide weapons and training for the Kurdistan Regional Government. On June 16, the Senate voted 54-45 for the amendment, but that wasn’t high enough to meet the 60 votes threshold for passage. Although Rubio skipped the vote, he was a co-sponsor of the amendment. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the original co-sponsor along with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in a statement that the goal was to arm the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces ""who are a critical partner in the fight against ISIS."" The Obama administration urged the Senate to reject the amendment, and Defense Secretary Ash Carter wrote a letter saying it could push the government of Iraq closer to Iran, Politico wrote. On June 18, Rubio voted in favor of the overall bill, which passed the Senate by 71-25 about a month after the bill passed the House. The ad omits that Rubio voted for the defense bill, and that Cruz voted against it. Cruz said that although the bill will ""increase military readiness,"" he said he could not vote for the bill because he promised, ""I would not vote for an NDAA that continued to allow the president to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by indefinitely detaining them without due process."" The rest of Rubio’s skipped votes were after the bill passed the Senate. Obama vetoed the bill on Oct. 22 in part because it prohibited funds to close Guantanamo Bay, one of his 2008 campaign promises. But after Obama signed a two-year budget deal, he signed the defense authorization bill on Nov. 25. Is it misleading to attack Rubio for missing 18 votes when they are the same bill? ""On the 18 votes, it is sort of fair, although of course not quite the same severity in terms of negligence of missing votes on 18 separate bills,"" said Norm Ornstein, political scientist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""But the vast majority of the votes were on important things, and it is a key bill that is right in Rubio's self-proclaimed wheelhouse, so I see it as fair game."" We sent a summary of our findings to Rubio’s spokespersons and did not get a reply. Our ruling A pro-Cruz PAC said that Marco Rubio ""skipped 18 defense votes, including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS."" The ad is misleading because it omits that the 18 votes related to the same bill: the National Defense Authorization Act, a comprehensive defense bill. The ad also omits that Rubio voted for the overall bill, which passed the Senate. The majority of the skipped votes were amendments, while many others were procedural or related to votes after the bill passed the Senate. The ad also omits that Cruz voted against the bill. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809732A940>],/factchecks/2016/mar/08/keep-promise-1-pac/pro-ted-cruz-pac-says-marco-rubio-skipped-18-defen/
