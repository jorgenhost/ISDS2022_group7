NASCAR executive says many fans serve in military
 ","
When the Army dropped its sponsorship of a NASCAR racing team, the good ol’ boy institution responded with wonkish restraint.

A statement from Stewart-Haas Racing said the change was due to the Army’s ""reallocation of its marketing budget."" NASCAR’s statement was written in business speak and
included a statistic:

""NASCAR fans are twice as likely as non fans to serve in the military and 37 percent of active servicemembers and veterans are NASCAR fans,"" NASCAR Chief Marketing Officer Steve Phelps said in a July 10 article in The Hill, which covers Congress.

The National Guard still sponsors a team. This is just the kind of data NASCAR might publicize to coax it to stay.

Is it correct?

The threat of losing the Guard is real. U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., regularly introduces attempts to stop all military sports sponsorships, not just NASCAR.

This year, she gained the support of Republican U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah, a budget hawk. They failed, but with federal budget cuts on the horizon, sponsorships remain at risk.

We reached out to NASCAR, academics, private research companies, McCollum and Kingston.

Kingston’s office did not respond. An official from McCollum’s office criticized Phelps’ claim but gave no specific data.

NASCAR sent us proprietary information from Experian Consumer Research, a private data company. The findings came from a survey of about 25,000 U.S. adults, including nonfans.

Experian found that 18 percent of NASCAR fans serve or have served in the armed forces or reserves, compared with 9 percent of nonfans. In other words, fans were twice as likely to serve or be veterans.

This is close to what Phelps said. He said fans were twice as likely ""to serve"" in the military.

Experian also reported that about 37 percent of current or past military members were fans, just as Phelps said.

There are shortcomings in Experian’s data. The definition of ""fan"" was broad. It includes respondents who said they were ""very,"" ""somewhat"" or ""a little bit"" interested in NASCAR.

Also, the findings are not the result of a peer-reviewed study published in an academic journal -- the gold standard of research. NASCAR paid for the data.

These factors do not discredit the poll, but we’d have more confidence in its findings if other surveys had similar results.    

Confirmation was hard to find.  

""In general, there is a bizarrely scant amount of NASCAR research among sport fandom scholars,"" said John Spinda, an assistant professor at Murray State University in Kentucky. He has published research on NASCAR.

Still, Spinda and others agreed that NASCAR’s military data made sense in light of other research.

""NASCAR fans are more likely to be male and less likely to be college-educated, so it makes sense that fans would be more likely to be involved in the military,"" said Larry DeGaris, director of the Academic Sports Marketing Program at the University of Indianapolis.

DeGaris is also president of the company Sponsorship Research & Strategy, which researches corporate sponsorship. A  2006 poll of more than 1,000 respondents found that 56 percent of those who described themselves as fans were male.

The private firm Scarborough Research asked 200,000 people whether they had ""any interest in NASCAR"" in its survey from August 2010 through September 2011. Fans were 31 percent more likely to be male than U.S. adults in general, and 13 percent were less likely to have graduated from college.

James Dertouzos has studied military sponsorships as senior economist at the nonprofit RAND Corp. He said NASCAR’s audience is also more likely to be blue-collar, middle-class, Southern or Midwestern, and politically conservative

""These are exactly the people who have positive impressions of service in the military,"" Dertouzos said. RAND is an independent research institute with roots in the U.S. military and defense industries.

Data support his statement. Scarborough reported fans were 19 percent more likely to be blue-collar workers.

That company’s 2009 data, posted on NASCAR’s website, also agree with Dertouzos’ assessment that fans are more likely to be Midwestern and Southern, although Sponsorship Research & Strategy found they were more evenly distributed.

DeGaris’ group found fans were more likely to be Republican.  

It’s worth noting that Scarborough found that fans were 18 percent more likely to have ""military specific"" jobs.

This appears to support Phelps’ claim, but researchers surveyed few people in this category. These findings are not as reliable as their other data, a spokeswoman told us.  

Our conclusion:

What little data that exists appears to support Phelps’ points that NASCAR fans are more likely to serve, and that service members and veterans are more likely to be fans.

Phelps appears to give a correct impression, although supporting data are thin. We give him a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972E2840>],/factchecks/2012/aug/17/steve-phelps/nascar-executive-says-many-fans-serve-military/
"['Tennessee', 'Education', 'Arne Duncan']","
Secretary of Education says Tennessee proof education funding is working
","
U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan argued in a recent online column that investments in education funding and incentives are starting to pay off.

To make his case, he presented Tennessee’s new teacher evaluation system as Exhibit A.

""After one year, Tennessee’s students made their biggest single-year jump in achievement ever recorded in the state,"" Duncan wrote in The Huffington Post on July 23, 2012.

Duncan was citing a recent Tennessee Department of Education report that examined the first year of implementing the state’s controversial new teacher evaluation system.

""As Tennessee has shown,"" Duncan concluded, ""our children, our teachers and our country will be better off when school leaders and educators finally undertake the challenging task of creating a meaningful and useful system for supporting and evaluating our nation’s teachers.""

In 2011, Tennessee became one of the first states in the country to implement a comprehensive, student outcomes-based teacher evaluation system. The evaluations were part of broader school-reform legislation that passed the General Assembly with bipartisan support in 2010.

The evaluation standards were enacted as part of Tennessee’s application for the $4 billion federal Race to the Top competition, which provides grants to states in recognition of education innovation and reform. Tennessee was one of the first two states to receive grants under the program.

Fifty percent of the new teacher evaluations were required under state law to be based on student achievement data, including student growth on the Tennessee Value-Added Assessment System (TVAAS) or a comparable measure, as well as additional measures of student achievement.

The other 50 percent of the teacher evaluations were to be determined through ""qualitative measures,"" such a teacher observations, personal conferences and a review of prior evaluations and work.

The evaluations were controversial from the beginning, especially with the Tennessee Education Association. Teachers argued the evaluations punished them rather than helping them improve. Some teachers complained they don’t teach subjects covered by the state tests, yet they are nonetheless judged on student test scores in those areas.

We won’t attempt to analyze or fact-check all of the criticisms about the teacher evaluations, although we will note that an education advocacy group tapped by Gov. Bill Haslam to review the system recommended a number of improvements on June 11, 2012.

A month later, the Tennessee Department of Education released its own one-year report on how the implementation has gone. That report also recommended a number of improvements and is the basis for Duncan’s column in The Huffington Post.

For our purposes, we will stick to fact-checking Duncan’s claim that student achievement experienced its largest gains in the year after the evaluations were implemented.

The state Department of Education report gives credence to Duncan’s statement.

""The 2011-12 school year saw tremendous progress for public education in Tennessee, as measured by the most significant outcome – student achievement,"" the report said. ""Test scores improved, in aggregate, at a faster rate than any previously measured year.""

Math and science test scores, in particular, increased significantly, the report noted.

""To put this in perspective,"" the report said, ""55,000 more students are at or above grade level in math than in 2010; 38,000 more students are at or above grade level in science.""

There is a caveat, however. In measuring student achievement, the state Education Department tracked the aggregate gains on statewide testing only as far back as 2007, said Kate Shellnutt, a spokeswoman for the department.

That’s because the state now reports scores for grades 3-8 and high school subjects. Prior to 2007, the state reported scores for grades K-8 and high school. Comparing test scores now to anything prior to 2007 would not have been an apples-to-apples comparison. Also worth noting -- beginning in 2010, the tests for every subject and grade level became much more rigorous.

Regardless, the growth and achievement over the past year ""represents real change in the academic trajectory and potential life options for Tennessee students and can be the very real difference between long-term success and failure,"" the Education Department report said.

The report attributed the strong academic performance to a number of factors, including higher academic standards; an accountability framework that recognizes ambitious but achievable goals; stronger professional development offerings funded in many cases through districts’ Race to the Top plans; and continued state financial investment in K-12 education despite a challenging budget climate.

""We also believe teacher evaluation has played an important role in our student achievement gains as administrators have specifically cited its role in improving instruction,"" the report said.

Our ruling

While the new teacher evaluation system continues to be controversial, the state Department of Education report says it is at least partly responsible for the academic gains Tennessee students have made over the past year. During that period, student test scores approved, in aggregate, at a faster rate than any year since 2007, the most recent year in which comparable data is available.

In his column, Secretary Duncan left out a couple of qualifiers about the student achievement – namely, that the teacher evaluations are partly but not solely responsible for the student improvement, and that comparable data on student achievement is available only back as far as 2007. Still, his larger point – that Tennessee students have made historic academic gains in the past year – is backed up by the state report. Thus, we rate his claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B557C0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/16/arne-duncan/secretary-education-says-tennessee-proof-education/

Do Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to turn Medicare into a voucher program?
","
In their attacks against Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, the Obama campaign and Democratic allies have been repeating a familiar word: vouchers.

During a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa, on Aug. 15, 2012, President Barack Obama said, ""I’ve strengthened Medicare. I've made reforms that save millions of seniors with Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs. We're closing the doughnut hole. I've proposed reforms that will save Medicare money by getting rid of wasteful spending in the health care system. Reforms that will not touch your Medicare benefits.

""And Gov. Romney and his running mate have a different plan. They want to turn Medicare into a voucher system. That means seniors would no longer have the guarantee of Medicare -- they’d get a voucher to buy private insurance. And if it doesn’t keep up with costs, well, that’s the seniors' problem. It was estimated that Gov. Romney's running mate, his original plan would force seniors to pay an extra $6,400 a year.""

We wondered whether Romney and Ryan really ""want to turn Medicare into a voucher system.""

""Voucher"" is a word Democrats have used over the years to criticize a variety of Republican privatization proposals, such as efforts to help private schools. Republicans don't like the word and try to avoid it. Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant specializing in ""message creation and image management,"" boasts on his website that he ""moved the public debate from ‘school vouchers’ to ‘opportunity scholarships.’""

In the context of Medicare, Republicans prefer to call it ""premium support"" -- the one Ryan himself has used from day one when talking about his own proposals. A Romney-Ryan spokesman told us the campaign considers it a ""premium support"" plan, not a voucher plan.

Both sides are acting in self-interest, said Ben Zimmer, executive producer of the Visual Thesaurus and Vocabulary.com and language columnist for The Boston Globe. ""I can understand Republican willingness to embrace this alternative term, just as I can understand Democratic eagerness to remind voters of the dreaded ‘v-word’ at every turn,"" Zimmer said.

In this item, we will sort through the claims and see whether it’s reasonable for Obama to call the Romney-Ryan plan for Medicare a ""voucher system.""

We'll start with the dictionary. Merriam-Webster defines a voucher as ""a written affidavit or authorization … a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child's education in either a public or private school.""

 Ryan’s plans

The initial Ryan plan that used ""premium supports"" was released in early 2011 and was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate, where Democrats called it radical and argued that it shifted too much of Medicare’s financial burden to beneficiaries.

Under Ryan’s original plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This would have affected people who today are under 55 only. The private plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

Ryan has since offered updated versions of the plan, the first in conjunction with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and then as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal.

Ryan’s most recent plan is similar to his original one, with one key difference. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based in part on the second least-expensive plan available on the exchange.

But note that Obama said, ""Gov. Romney and his running mate have a different plan."" Is the most recent Ryan plan also official policy for the Romney campaign?

In an interview with a Green Bay, Wis., television station on Aug. 15, Romney said, ""Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical."" Based on this, we’ll evaluate Obama’s claim based on the most recent Ryan plan.

A history of ‘premium support’

When Ryan unveiled his plan, Democrats poked fun at him for avoiding the term ""voucher."" At a hearing on the plan, Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said, ""My Republican colleagues don't like the sound of ‘voucher’ to describe their plan, so they've made up a new term called ‘premium support.’""

Actually, that term has been around since a 1995 paper co-authored by two health policy experts, Henry Aaron, of the Brookings Institution, and Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director who was then at Brookings. ""Premium support"" also was used in a Medicare overhaul proposed by the bipartisan Breaux-Thomas commission in 1999 and in the 2010 Rivlin-Domenici proposal from the Bipartisan Policy Center.

Each of these proposals had somewhat different details, but what they broadly shared is changing Medicare from a program in which the government pays the bills directly to one in which the government gives money to the beneficiary, who spends it on an insurance plan.

In their 1995 paper, Aaron and Reischauer proposed that Medicare ""pay a defined sum toward the purchase of an insurance policy that provided a defined set of services"" -- an approach they billed as a ""middle ground"" between a separate national health care system for the aged and a ""pure voucher system"" within a ""lightly regulated marketplace.""

Aaron -- who no longer supports the idea of premium support, saying the cost-control provisions of President Barack Obama’s health care law serve the purpose he intended -- reiterated in a blog post earlier this year that there are several key differences between a voucher program and premium support.

For a proposal to qualify as premium support, Aaron wrote, it’s crucial to peg the beneficiaries’ payment to the actual rise in health care costs so people don't end up having to pay more because of inflation. Voucher plans that don’t do this ""are virtually guaranteed to become increasingly inadequate,"" he wrote.

So does the Ryan plan meet the definition of premium support? While his original plan was pegged to overall consumer prices, the most recent Ryan plan is pegged to the lower end of health care premiums. That’s closer to the Aaron-Reischauer definition than his first plan was, though the fact that it’s tied to the low end rather than average costs suggests that payment size could still lag typical health care prices.

The notion that there’s a substantive difference between ""premium support"" and ""vouchers"" receives some support from free-market supporters. Michael Tanner, a health care analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the original Ryan plan, ""leaned more toward a voucher,"" whereas Ryan’s second plan was ""clearly premium support.""

Robert Moffit, a health policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, agrees with Aaron that there’s a distinction between ""voucher"" and ""premium support,"" though he draws the opposite conclusion, arguing that the Obama campaign’s use of the term ""voucher"" is not justified, since the Ryan plan includes more regulation than for, say, airline vouchers for food and drink.

Looking at linguistics

The differences between vouchers and premium support may matter to health-policy professionals, but not necessarily to a general audience. And while the 1995 Aaron-Reischauer paper may have offered a detailed definition for ""premium support,"" language tends to evolve over nearly two decades.

In recent years, the definitions of ""premium support"" and ""vouchers"" have become almost indistinguishable, with plans such as Breaux-Thomas and Rivlin-Domenici using ""premium support"" to describe policies that weren’t identical to those from the 1995 paper. Reischauer made this argument when he told PolitiFact that he thinks the Obama campaign ""is on firm ground"" using the term ""voucher.""

Even more convincingly, the 1995 paper didn’t say that premium support wasn’t a voucher -- it said that it wasn’t a ""pure"" voucher. This means that ""premium support"" may be seen as just one type of voucher, not the opposite of a voucher.

Aaron told us he agreed with that reasoning. Take away the requirements listed in the 1995 paper, he said, ""and you have a bare-bones voucher."" Adhere to these requirements, he said, ""and you have premium support. That means, I think, that premium support is a type of voucher.""

Our ruling

We agree that in the world of policy wonks, there are distinctions between ""vouchers"" and ""premium support,"" having to do with the type of inflation adjustment used and the degree of marketplace regulation imposed. Compared with his original plan, Ryan’s most recent plan does move closer to fitting the definition of pure premium support. But substantively, it’s still somewhere in between the two approaches.

But the Romney-Ryan approach pretty much matches the dictionary definition of ""a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures."" We think that describes the general way Ryan's plan would work. For a political discussion aimed at voters rather than policy wonks, we think Obama’s use of the term ""voucher"" is close enough to earn it a rating of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A79C0>],/factchecks/2012/aug/16/barack-obama/does-paul-ryan-want-turn-medicare-voucher-program/
"['Education', 'Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Eva Longoria Baston']","
""Desperate Housewives"" actress and Obama activist says Paul Ryan's budget cuts grants for nearly 10 million college students
","On the day Mitt Romney named U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, actress Eva Longoria fired off a series of Twitter attacks on the presumptive Republican presidential ticket.

The Aug. 11, 2012 tweets by Longoria, who describes herself as an activist as well as an actress, included this one:

""Today Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan, who wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students!""

Longoria is no politician, but she is political, serving as a national co-chair of President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.

Known for her role as Gabrielle Solis on the TV series ""Desperate Housewives,"" Longoria has appeared at Obama campaign events since being chosen to one of the 35 largely ceremonial co-chair posts. At a Denver rally in July 2012, she told Obama supporters: ""We have to get out there and tell (others) ‘If you’re a woman, there is no way you can vote Republican.’""

But what about financially needy college students? How would Ryan’s plan affect them?

Longoria’s evidence

Longoria’s tweet about Ryan and student aid included a link to a page on Obama’s campaign website focused on Romney and Ryan. (So did a tweet nearly identical to Longoria’s made the same day by actress Ashley Judd.) The page slams a budget proposal Ryan made as chairman of the House Budget Committee.

""To pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest,"" the Ryan plan would, among other things, cut ""Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students,"" the Obama campaign says.

So, we know where Longoria got the information for her tweet. But the site doesn’t provide any evidence that would back the claim.

Fortunately, our colleagues at PolitiFact National evaluated a similar statement made by Obama himself in April 2012, a few days after the GOP-controlled House approved Ryan’s budget resolution. (The plan didn't pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate.)

Obama said that if spending reductions in the resolution ""were to be spread out evenly,"" nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each. The White House told our colleagues the president was referring to the Pell Grant program.

So, Ryan's plan does not specify cuts to Pell Grants. Obama is simply applying the total spending cuts in the plan evenly across the overall budget to derive a Pell Grant number.

Dissecting Obama’s claim

Let’s look at what PolitiFact National found in evaluating Obama’s statement:

Federal Pell Grants provide the largest source of grant funding for needy college students (although Ryan contends the grants should be targeted more to lower-income students). More than 9.7 million students are expected to get grants in 2013, according to the U.S. Education Department.

By the president’s calculation, applying the Ryan budget cuts evenly would reduce the maximum Pell grant -- $5,500 for the 2011-2012 school year -- to $4,595, leaving some students with nothing at all and cutting grants for nearly 10 million students by an average of more than $1,000 per student.

Budget experts said that because the Ryan spending cuts lacked detail, it was fair for Obama to assume the cuts would be applied evenly. But Obama himself acknowledged that Republicans hadn’t specified the Pell cuts themselves and that they might apply cuts in ways other than he assumed.

Indeed, the Ryan plan budget resolution -- which is a guidance document, not a line-by-line budget -- doesn’t mention Pell grant funding; and any funding cuts would be made by House committees. Moreover, a House Budget Committee report accompanying Ryan’s budget resolution suggested the maximum Pell grant remain at $5,500, contradictory to Obama’s claim.

Our colleagues concluded that Obama’s statement was accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignored what House Republicans said was a preference that Pell grant maximums not be reduced.

Obama’s claim was rated Half True.

FactCheck.org also looked at Pell Grants and Ryan’s plan. The University of Pennsylvania-based fact checkers concluded""it is certainly true that Ryan’s budget would require deep spending cuts,"" but ""it is hard to know what impact Ryan’s budget would have on specific programs because the plan contains so few details.""

We also sought input from Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama’s campaign in Wisconsin, and Kevin Seifert, campaign manager for Ryan, who remains on the November 2012 ballot for his House seat.

Obama’s campaign cited an April 2012 opinion column by The New York Times’ Paul Krugman, which claims without evidence that 1 million students would lose Pell grants altogether. But that wasn’t Obama’s or Longoria’s claim. The campaign also provided a March 2012 blog post by Obama’s Office of Management and Budget director, but it uses the same assumptions the president did in his claim.

Ryan’s plan would make fewer students eligible for Pell money, according to an article in the conservative National Review cited by Ryan’s spokesman. But while bringing Pell spending ""under control,"" the budget would nevertheless maintain the maximum Pell grant at $5,500, Ryan wrote in response to criticism of his plan.

Our rating

Longoria said Ryan ""wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students.""

Her claim is slightly different than one made by Obama, who arrived at his 10 million figure by assuming spending cuts called for in Ryan's budget plan would be made uniformly across federal programs. Nevertheless, she uses Obama's methodology in making her claim.

We’re giving Longoria the same rating Obama got for making a claim that is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772BB40>],/factchecks/2012/aug/16/eva-longoria/desperate-housewives-actress-obama-activist-says-p/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Lou Greenwald']","
Lou Greenwald claims New Jersey students represent nearly a third of all college freshmen who attend school out of their home state
","
New Jersey shells out nearly the most in the country to educate its public school students.

But, in at least one area, the yield on that investment is lackluster: more residents leave New Jersey to attend college than in any other state, according to Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald.

When asked about a November bond referendum for construction at state colleges in an Aug. 9 interview with the liberal blog Blue Jersey, Greenwald, a South Jersey Democrat, said the focus should be on ""how do we keep our best and brightest students here in New Jersey.""

""We spend more on public education, kindergarten to 12th grade, than any other state in the country yet we have the highest exodus of graduating high school seniors who are more than qualified to go to the schools that we have here in the state,"" Greenwald said. ""We just don't have the capacity. A lot of that has helped drive up costs. So the capital construction to expand access for New Jersey residents is critically important. If you think about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount.""

Do New Jerseyans really represent nearly a third of all students across the country who go to an out-of-state school?

Statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, highlight a major flaw in Greenwald’s statement: far more than 100,000 students nationwide pursue a postsecondary education at an out-of-state institution.

In fall 2010 -- the most recent data available -- more than 515,000 freshmen across the country started college at an out-of-state school. Nearly 393,000 of those students finished high school in the previous year.

So Greenwald scores no points for accuracy there.

Brian McGinnis, Greenwald’s communications director, said we were ""missing the forest for the trees.""

""There’s a serious brain drain that’s disproportionately happening in New Jersey,"" he said, adding that Greenwald’s overall point -- that New Jersey ""sends more homegrown students out of state than any other state"" -- was correct.

Nearly 35,000 New Jerseyans left home to attend college for the first time in fall 2010. Of those students, more than 31,000 finished high school the previous year.

No other state had a larger amount of students in either group attend out-of-state schools, but California and New York -- two states with significantly larger populations -- weren’t far behind.

More than 34,500 students -- nearly 28,300 of whom recently finished high school --  left California for college in fall 2010. In New York, more than 33,900 students left the state for school in fall 2010. Of those students, more than 28,600 were graduated from high school in the previous year.   

Greenwald was comparing the amount of New Jerseyans who leave the state for college to a nationwide figure, but  it’s worth nothing that as a percentage -- a ""more accurate barometer"" for comparing states according to Joseph Stetar, a professor of education at Seton Hall University -- four other states send more students out-of-state for college.

A larger percentage of all first-time freshman students in Alaska, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont attended college outside of their home state than New Jersey in fall 2010.  

Our ruling

Greenwald said ""about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount.""

Roughly 30,000 recent high school graduates left New Jersey to attend an out-of-state college, according to federal data. That part of Greenwald’s claim is true.

But far more than 100,000 students attend out-of-state schools and though New Jersey students represented the largest portion of that group, California and New York followed closely behind.

So we rate this statement Half True.

"['Deficit', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Florida', 'Americans for Prosperity']","
Did Obama say of the national debt, “If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition”?
","
A new commercial from the conservative group Americans for Prosperity accuses Obama of breaking his promises on the national debt.

The ad notes, ""In 2009, Barack Obama said,"" then cuts to Obama: ""I’m pledging to cut the deficit by half by the end of my first term in office."" The words ""Feb. 2009, Debt: $10 trillion"" flash onscreen.

A giant meter titled ""the national debt clock"" then appears on screen, reading $10.6 trillion. As talking heads recount the upward spiral of the nation’s debt, the clock frantically spins above $15 trillion.

Obama is then heard saying, ""I will be held accountable"" before appearing in a video and continuing, ""If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.""

The debt clock returns, reading in excess of $15.9 trillion with the tagline, ""Let’s make this a one-term proposition on November 6th."" In a voice-over, the president is heard repeating, ""I will be held accountable.""

Well, time’s up, Mr. President. Did Obama say he would be held accountable for not halving the deficit in three years? When we went to the tape, we found Americans for Prosperity was pulling together two different interviews, and on two different topics.

The deficit debate

First off, it should be no secret Obama did, in fact, promise to cut the deficit in half during his first term. We’ve confirmed that before, rating that very claim by Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry quite True.

That ruling pointed out the federal budget deficit -- the difference between what the government spends versus what it takes in -- was $1.4 trillion when Obama took office. It decreased each year, projected to reach $901 billion in the fiscal year 2013 budget, but that’s still over the promised amount, which would have been in the neighborhood of $700 billion.

With the presence of the debt clock, Americans For Prosperity is confusing the deficit with the national debt, which is the aggregated total of the nation’s public debt, not its annual budget deficits. AFP didn’t return our request for clarification, so we can only guess if they know the difference. Most Americans don’t seem to know the specifics, either.

The promise Obama made was from a White House meeting called the ""Fiscal Responsibility Summit"" on Feb. 23, 2009.

""Today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office,"" Obama said. ""Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""

Note the phrase ""we inherited"" was removed from the ad’s version. That alone doesn’t make AFP’s usage of the sentence for the purposes of this attack ad untrue; Despite the president’s reasoning that high unemployment, wartime costs and the Great Recession prevented deeper cuts, budget numbers are still budget numbers.

Staying on message

The selective editing gets worse in the second half of the ad.

Obama’s admission that the voters will likely break out the torches and pitchforks if he doesn’t follow through in three years is from a 2009 interview with Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show.

It’s from Feb. 2, however, almost three weeks before his pledge to cut the deficit.

And the president is speaking about the Troubled Asset Relief Program, not halving the deficit.

During the interview, Lauer asked Obama if the bank bailouts he inherited would be curtailed if spending appeared to be ineffective. (President George W. Bush signed TARP into law October 2008, before Obama was elected.)

""Look, I'm at the start of my administration,"" Obama said. ""One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years, and --""

""You're going to know quickly how people feel about what's happening,"" Lauer interjected.

""That's exactly right. And, you know, a year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress, but there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.""

For the record, TARP officially expired in October 2010. The net cost of the program to U.S. taxpayers was reported earlier this year to be in the neighborhood of $34 billion, although questions remain as to exactly how some banks repaid the bulk of some $428 billion in disbursements and whether many banks in the program were going to survive. But no more money is being lent from the TARP fund.

We should note there’s been a troubling trend this election season of campaigns splicing together unrelated or out-of-context video of a candidate’s statements.

Mitt Romney’s campaign used Obama’s ""you didn’t build that"" quote out of context, but Democrats have also deceptively quoted Romney’s stance on his Massachusetts ban on assault weapons and dealing with foreclosures.

Editing video to make a person say what you want is not a new tactic, nor is it that hard to do -- here’s a video of Obama singing Carly Rae Jepsen’s Call Me Maybe.

The ruling

Clearly this commercial is edited to remove references to the Bush administration and muddy the context of the president’s comments. Obama irrefutably made the promise in 2009 to slash the deficit in half by the time his first term expired, and that doesn’t look at all possible.

But Americans For Prosperity overreaches, splicing together footage from two unrelated interviews to distort the message it wants to convey. Obama wasn’t talking about the deficit or the debt when he said, ""If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.""

In this instance, the piling on is unnecessary to make the group’s point, and it’s intentionally misleading. The ad takes Obama’s comments from an interview about bank bailouts and TARP and makes it look as if he’s talking about the national debt. The use of the debt clock also purposely detracts from the president’s initial statement about the federal deficit.

Mitt Romney said Barack Obama robs Medicare of more than $700 billion to pay for Obamacare
","
Medicare is a hot topic in the presidential race since Mitt Romney picked U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan to be his running mate.

Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare.

Ryan’s plan is for people who are under age 55 now. It would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called ""premium support."")

Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan’s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, and Democrats have vigorously attacked the proposal as a voucher plan and worse. The Romney campaign, meanwhile, refutes those charges by saying President Barack Obama has targeted Medicare himself.

Here’s how Romney put it in an interview with 60 Minutes shortly after selecting Ryan:

""There's only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare, $716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare.""

Here, we’re checking whether Obama ""robbed"" Medicare of $716 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.

$700 billion from Medicare?

The claim that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare is relatively new. Not long ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking?

First things first: Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program’s budget.

Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.

What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. 
Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. 
Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. 
Under the new law, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.

Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.

The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.

So it’s timing that’s making the cuts bigger, not changes to Medicare.

Historic steal for ‘Obamacare’?

Now, to address the word ""robbed."" We know the civility is at a low ebb these days, but we think it’s worth pointing out that the money was not robbed in any literal sense of the word.

Congress passed the law through its normal process, and the proposal was debated out in the open during the many weeks that the final law was being negotiated.

At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. That spending is primarily to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. But some new spending increases Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for seniors.

Finally, Romney said Obama is the ""only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare."" In reality, several presidents have reduced Medicare spending.

We reviewed this history in detail in a fact-check of Romney’s statement from December, ""Only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country . . . Barack Obama."" We rated that False. Many presidents have sought to rein in Medicare spending.

Here are a few highlights from that fact-check:

• President Ronald Reagan cut Medicare by reducing payments to hospitals, and he cut benefits by raising deductibles.
   
• President George H.W. Bush cut benefits by repealing a law that would have expanded coverage for drugs and catastrophic illness.
   
• President Bill Clinton cut Medicare by changing payments to doctors and other providers, which could be considered to have an indirect effect on beneficiaries.

Our ruling

Romney said, ""There's only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare, $716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare.""

The only element of truth here is that the health care law seeks to reduce future Medicare spending, and the tally of those cost reductions over the next 10 years is $716 billion. The money wasn’t ""robbed,"" however, and other presidents have made similar reductions to the Medicare program.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Retirement', 'Stephanie Cutter']","
Ryan's plan includes $700 billion in Medicare ""cuts,"" says Stephanie Cutter
","
Mitt Romney’s pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare.

Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare.

Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65.

Ryan’s idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called ""premium support."")

Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan’s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan.

The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut ""$700 billion"" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too!

For this check, we’re looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom.

""You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,"" Cutter said. ""You know what those cuts are? It’s taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget."" 
It’s a lot to digest if you’re not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them ""cuts"" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget.

$700 billion in Medicare cuts?

Because we’re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking?

Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally ""cut"" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget.

Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.

What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.

Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.

Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.

Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.

The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.

So it’s timing that’s making the ""cuts"" bigger, not changes to Medicare.

 Does the Ryan budget ‘protect those cuts’?

Now onto our second question: Does Ryan’s budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes.

Here’s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romney’s running mate:

Stephanopoulos: ""You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts.

Ryan: ""Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ..."" (Read the full exchange.)

So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings.

The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter’s remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare.

""Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama’s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,"" said Lanhee Chen, Romney’s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. ""A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.""

Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn’t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn’t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office.

Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law.

That’s because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in.

Our ruling

Cutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but ""Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget."" Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan. 
Cutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying Romney’s plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan.

Still, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BB9D00>],/factchecks/2012/aug/15/stephanie-cutter/ryans-plan-includes-700-billion-medicare-cuts-says/
"['New Jersey', 'Elections', 'States', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says Mitt Romney isn’t counting on New Jersey to win presidency
","Mitt Romney can rely on the vote of at least one New Jerseyan in November: Gov. Chris Christie.

But even Christie, a top Romney surrogate tapped to deliver the keynote address on Aug. 28 at the Republican National Convention, admits the rest of the state isn’t likely to swing in favor of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.

""I don't think Mitt Romney's counting our electoral votes in his column. I believe the overwhelming likelihood is that President [Barack] Obama will win New Jersey. I think all the polls indicate that,"" Christie said during an Aug. 7 press conference

""A Republican hasn't won [an election] for a presidency in New Jersey since 1988. And so it's a been a long haul. Could it happen? Sure, it could happen. But I think if Mitt Romney wins New Jersey he's probably going to win in 45 other states,"" Christie said.

PolitiFact New Jersey can’t check Christie’s electoral prediction, but we can test his claim about the state’s past votes on the Truth-O-Meter. Was 1988 the last time New Jersey went red in a presidential election?

It’s true: a majority of voters in the Garden State cast votes in 1988 for the then-GOP presidential candidate George H. W. Bush.

That wasn’t an aberration at the time. Republican nominees had won New Jersey in every presidential election since 1968.  

Bush took New Jersey in 1988 with more than 56 percent of the vote, defeating Democratic rival Michael Dukakis to secure a spot in the White House.

But four years later, New Jersey voters decided against sending Bush back to Washington for a second term.

Bill Clinton edged out Bush in New Jersey in 1992, grabbing nearly 43 percent of the state’s vote. Bush lost the state with more than 40 percent of the vote.

Since then New Jersey has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election cycle.  

Here’s a breakdown of New Jersey’s presidential voting history:
    Our ruling

Christie said ""a Republican hasn't won [an election] for a presidency in New Jersey since 1988.""

When Bush took on Dukakis in 1988, a majority of New Jersey voters cast a ballot for the Republican candidate, helping send Bush to the White House.

But four years later, the tide turned in New Jersey and the state has voted Democratic in every presidential election since.

U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says Republican Brendan Doherty wants to raise Social Security eligibility age without regard for workers in physically demanding jobs
","
First-term Democratic Congressman David Cicilline has been circulating a campaign flier attacking Republican Brendan Doherty over the issue of Social Security reform.

The two-column flier draws a contrast between the candidates over one of the most pressing issues facing Washington: how to keep the Social Security trust fund from running dry in the next 20 years.

In one column, there is this statement: ""David will continue to fight against any efforts to privatize Social Security or reduce benefits."" The opposing column states: ""Doherty wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits for anyone born after 1960, with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations.""

Doherty, the former head of the Rhode Island State Police, has said that raising the retirement age of Americans born around 1960 is worth considering. It’s the second part of that sentence that caught PolitiFact’s attention: ""with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations."" Had Doherty said that?

The flier states as its source an appearance Doherty made on  ""Newsmakers"" on Channel 12 (WPRI) -- though it cites the broadcast date inaccurately. (It says ""3/10/2010."" The show actually aired March 11, 2012.)  

Raising the eligibility age of Social Security recipients -- it’s now 67 for those born in 1960 or later  -- has been talked about since at least 2010 when a bipartisan budget commission appointed by President Obama considered it.

Mr. Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to propose ways to balance the federal budget by 2015. It became known as the Simpson-Bowles commission after its two co-chairmen: former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, of Wyoming, and Democrat Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton.

As part of its suggestion to raise the eligibility age, the Simpson-Bowles report specifically calls for a hardship exemption for people who work physically demanding jobs, such as fishermen or construction workers. Their strenuous professions would probably force them to retire by 62, the report says, and they would need retirement income when they do.

During the ""Newsmakers"" interview, Doherty is asked a general question about what kinds of changes might people expect in Social Security coverage 10 years from now.

Doherty uses the opportunity to first reiterate that he would protect the benefits of seniors and those about to enter the system but  ""down the road we need to look at Social Security .... I  believe there are some good talking points in Simpson-Bowles.""

Doherty is never asked any specific questions about how he feels about hardship exemptions nor does he bring up the issue, a point Ted Nesi, one of the show’s co-hosts, made last week in a blog post.

When we asked Cicilline’s campaign for any other evidence of Doherty’s position, campaign manager Eric Hyers said Doherty’s lack of specific mention of the hardship exemptions shows he doesn’t support them and has ""no regard for the challenges"" of those who work in physically demanding jobs.

The flier ""is 100 percent accurate,"" Hyers contends.

""He has talked many, many times about raising the age of Social Security,"" said Hyers. ""Never once has he talked about these exemptions. ... If this was a serious concern of his it would have come up.""

Besides, Hyers said, the flier doesn’t actually say Doherty ""opposes an exemption. It only says he has not made a point to speak about it.""

(In fact, the flier says Doherty wants to raise the eligibility raise ""with no regard"" for physically challenging jobs.)

We asked the Doherty camp whether their candidate had ever in the past specifically mentioned whether he supported the hardship exemption. Just one reference would undeniably show that the Cicilline campaign was wrong.

Doherty campaign manager Robert Coupe said he didn’t think so because Doherty always talks about Social Security ""in terms of the Simpson-Bowles proposal and this [the hardship exemptions] is part of it.

""Just because you don’t specifically say something doesn’t mean you can say they have no regard for it. That’s like asking us to disprove a negative.""

Our ruling

A David Cicilline campaign flier says Brendan Doherty wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits for anyone born after 1960 ""with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations.""

But the Cicilline campaign provided no evidence that Doherty ever espoused that position.

Attacking someone for what he hasn’t specifically said -- that he supports the exemption -- defies logic, particularly since Doherty says he does support the Simpson-Bowles proposal, which would include the hardship exemptions if the eligibility age is raised.

We rate the statement False.

Florida is No. 1 in concealed permits, Rick Scott says
","
After yucking it up on a Gulf of Mexico fishing trip, Govs. Rick Perry and Rick Scott sat for a wide-ranging interview with Fox News Channel’s Your World with Neil Cavuto.

In the interview (transcript here), the governors talked about why Scott and not Perry was selected to speak at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, as well as Mitt Romney’s decision to select U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., as his running mate. They also were asked to comment about a recent shooting near Texas A&M University.

Both Perry and Scott cautioned about using the shooting as evidence that people’s gun rights should be restricted.

Scott then stated an amazing statistic about guns, if true.

""I mean, I think we have more concealed weapons permits than any other state because Floridians care about their right to bear arms.""

Florida is the fourth-most populous state in the country, so it’s no surprise it would be high on a concealed permit list. But is it No. 1 ahead of Perry’s Texas, which has 6 million more residents, and California, which is nearly double the size?

Turns out, yes. Scott is correct.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, recently studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state. Their report, available here, is dated July 2012 and includes concealed weapons permit data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases.

The top 10 of valid permits by state breaks down like this:

1. Florida -- 887,000;
2. Pennsylvania -- 786,000;
3. Georgia -- 600,000;
4. Texas -- 519,000;
5. Indiana -- 406,000;
6. Washington -- 351,000;
7. Utah -- 347,000;
8. Tennessee -- 341,000;
9. Michigan -- 296,000;
10. Virginia -- 279,000.

There’s two caveats to this list. First, several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. So people living outside of Florida may have a Florida permit. Records don’t distinguish by location.

Second, it’s worth noting that many states have reciprocity agreements regarding concealed weapons permits, meaning that a Texas license is valid in Florida and vice versa.

We don’t think either is enough to question the validity of Scott’s remark, however.

Three large states are missing from the Top 10 list. Illinois does not issue concealed weapons permits. California and New York are considered a ""may issue"" states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That in turn makes it harder to get one.

As a result, California has just 35,000 active permits, representing .1 percent of the adult active population, according to the analysis. Florida, a ""shall issue"" state, had a concealed weapons permit rate of 6.2 percent of its active adult population. Georgia ranks first at 11 percent.

Our ruling

Scott said Florida has ""more concealed weapons permits than any other state."" A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office study backs Scott up. The state has about 887,000 valid concealed weapons permits, nearly 100,000 more than the next closest state, Pennsylvania.

We rate this statement True.

"['National', 'Energy', 'Barack Obama']","
 Obama says Romney would end wind power tax credits
","
President Barack Obama raised concerns about the future of wind power at a campaign event in Colorado, a state that has done well with wind energy. Over 6 percent of its power comes from wind and a Danish turbine maker recently built a manufacturing plant there.

But the industry is fragile and Obama played to that when he said, ""At a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs in states like Colorado and Iowa, my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind producers.""

Obama was referring to Renewable Energy Production Tax Credits. The president says Mitt Romney wants to get rid of them -- and the Romney campaign agrees.

A Romney spokesman, Ryan Williams, says when the tax credits expire at the end of this year, Romney has no plans to renew them.

""Wind energy will thrive wherever it is economically competitive,"" Williams said.

It's worth noting that Romney's position on the tax breaks for wind energy is a major issue within the wind power industry.

These tax credits have been part of American energy policy since 1992. For every kilowatt hour of power from wind, the government gives the producer a tax credit worth 2.2 cents. If the average price of electricity is around 8.5 cents, as it was in Colorado in 2010, then the tax break can make wind power more competitive.

The tax credit has come and gone over the years. Investment analyst, Aris Karcanias, managing consultant at Navigant BTM, says as the tax credit goes, so goes the wind industry.

""The Production Tax Credit remains the largest driver of industry growth in the United States,"" Karcanias said. ""And uncertainty over its renewal has historically been accompanied by repeated ‘boom and bust’ cycles of growth.""

The past few years have been one of the ""boom""  times. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that wind projects created at least 52,000 jobs between 2009 and 2011. The Congressional Research Service reports that the country will add a record 10 to 12 gigawatts of capacity by the end of 2012. 
After the policy runs out, new construction is expected to plummet. But the congressional analysts don’t say that extending it would necessarily lead to an upswing. They say that competition from cheap natural gas and a limited rise in the demand for power will tend to put a damper on the industry regardless of federal tax policy.

Our Ruling

Barack Obama said Mitt Romney plans to put an end to tax credits that benefit the wind power industry. Romney agrees.

We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096784C00>],/factchecks/2012/aug/14/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-end-wind-power-tax-credits/

Did a New Mexico Rep. spend $1 trillion in tax dollars on a stimulus for ""failed companies here and jobs overseas""?
","
The American Future Fund, a group that advocates ""conservative and free-market"" principles, is targeting U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the Democratic nominee for a Senate seat being vacated later this year by Jeff Bingaman.

In the ad, titled ""Frustrating,"" a narrator says, ""The past few years have been frustrating and disappointing. Washington says the economy is better, but we sure don't see it. We're tightening our belts, but Washington is spending more and delivering less. Martin Heinrich told New Mexico he would fight unemployment, but he spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas. So thousands of New Mexicans remain jobless, and unemployment got worse. Tell Martin Heinrich to stop the wasteful spending that's hurting our economy.""

It’s correct that Heinrich voted for the stimulus bill known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But did that bill spend ""a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas""? (We tried to reach the American Future Fund but the group did not return our inquiries.)

First, we should note that while the bill was huge, its pricetag was not as big as the $1 trillion cited in the ad. The measure was passed with an estimated cost of $787 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office later revised that upward to $814 billion. Still, generous rounding isn’t the biggest problem with the ad’s claim.

The most significant problem is that the claim suggests that the stimulus bill spent that much money on ""failed companies here and jobs overseas."" Even allowing for some hyperbole, as we do the ad’s charge is way off base because it distorts how the stimulus was spent.

By our count, the overwhelming majority of the stimulus couldn't have possibly been spent on ""failed companies here and jobs overseas."" Here are just a few of the bigger examples of spending categories in the bill that don’t have anything to do with failed companies or jobs overseas. (It comes from a breakdown of stimulus-bill spending by recovery.gov, the federal government’s stimulus website, which uses a higher measurement of the bill’s cost -- $840 billion.)

• Individual tax credits for homebuyers, commuting, education and the Earned Income Tax Credit: $135.9 billion

• Making Work Pay tax credit for working individuals and families: $104.6 billion

• Medicaid and Medicare spending: $92.5 billion

• One-time payments to Social Security recipients: $13.8 billion

• Aid for public and Indian housing and homelessness prevention: $13.3 billion

• Science, research and development, including National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health: $13.2 billion

So what aspects of the bill might conceivably have led to aid for ""failed companies"" and supported ""jobs overseas""?

• Transportation spending, $35.3 billion

• Tax incentives for business, $33.5 billion

• Infrastructure spending, $28.6 billion

• Energy and environment spending, $26.3 billion

• Energy entitlements, $14.2 billion

• Energy tax incentives, $10.8 billion

• Manufacturing and economic recovery, infrastructure refinancing tax free bonds, $9.2 billion

If you add up all of these categories, the maximum you’d get is $158 billion. And that assumes that every penny spent by these portions of the bill -- which collectively account for 19 percent of the bill’s total cost -- would have been frittered away on failed companies and overseas jobs.

""The stimulus was basically one-third increased spending for existing programs, which could go to failed companies and jobs overseas, one-third for tax provisions that really can’t be guided that much and many of which were not going to companies at all, and one-third in payments to the states, which clearly was not going to failed companies here and jobs overseas,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Republicans are correct that some recipients of stimulus money failed, such as Solyndra, a solar manufacturer that received a $535 million federal loan guarantee in 2009 from the stimulus. The company got special attention from the Obama administration, which relished the idea of supporting manufacturing jobs and homegrown green energy. But the company collapsed spectacularly less than two years later, followed by an FBI raid and Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Taxpayers were on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.

Still, we've found Republicans' claims about Solyndra have often been exaggerated and given them mediocre ratings. And while $500 million is hardly chump change, it’s an exaggeration to say that any large percentage of the stimulus was spent on such failures.

For instance, we have noted serious problems with the claim in one ad that ""President Obama wasted $34 billion on risky investments."" While the Energy Department has committed $34.7 billion in low-interest loans to nearly 40 green projects, only Solyndra and one other company has filed for bankruptcy. Our friends at FactCheck.org calculated that the government could lose as much as $578 million on those two deals -- less than 2 percent of the total program, which itself is a small part of the stimulus as a whole.

Ads that claim the stimulus supported job creation overseas haven’t fared very well in our ratings, either.

Our ruling

A charitable interpretation of the ad would be that it was sloppily worded. That may be, but we think a viewer unfamiliar with the stimulus would come away with the idea that $1 trillion in tax dollars were spent on ""failed companies"" and ""jobs overseas.""

People are free to disagree with the wisdom of passing a stimulus and criticize the way Washington spent the money, but it’s flat wrong to suggest that any large percentage of stimulus spending ended up going to failed companies and jobs overseas. About four-fifths of the total spent was allocated to items that literally couldn’t go for those purposes. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096797D80>],/factchecks/2012/aug/14/american-future-fund/did-new-mexico-rep-spend-1-trillion-tax-dollars-st/

NBC’s Chuck Todd, ‘Meet the Press’ leave out key context in shortened Barr clip
","A clip played by NBC host Chuck Todd cut important context from Attorney General William Barr’s interview with CBS News, leaving the impression that Barr spoke only in political terms about his move to drop charges against former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. On ""Meet the Press,"" Todd played an abbreviated quote from Barr’s May 7 interview with CBS News' Catherine Herridge, in which Barr was asked how history would view his decision to reverse course on a prosecution that had already produced a guilty plea.  ""He didn’t make the case that he was upholding the rule of law,"" Todd said after the clip. ""He was almost admitting that, yeah, this is a political job."" But Todd’s description of Barr’s remarks was wrong. Barr did say he believed he was sticking up for the rule of law — and he said it immediately after the clip Todd presented was cut off. ""Meet the Press"" acknowledged the error in response to criticism from Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec on Twitter. NBC News declined to comment further, and Todd did not respond to a separate request for comment. ""Earlier today, we inadvertently and inaccurately cut short a video clip of an interview with AG Barr before offering commentary and analysis,"" the show said in a tweet. ""The remaining clip included important remarks from the attorney general that we missed, and we regret the error.""  You’re correct. Earlier today, we inadvertently and inaccurately cut short a video clip of an interview with AG Barr before offering commentary and analysis. The remaining clip included important remarks from the attorney general that we missed, and we regret the error. The discrepancy between Todd’s description of the clip he showed and Barr’s complete remarks drew backlash on Twitter from conservative pundits and politicians. President Donald Trump retweeted several criticisms and called more than once for the ""Meet the Press"" host to be fired, tagging the Federal Communications Commission and its chairman, Ajit Pai. ""Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd should be FIRED by ""Concast"" (NBC) for this fraud,"" Trump said in one tweet, using his pejorative nicknames for Todd and Comcast, NBC’s parent company. ""He knew exactly what he was doing.""  Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd should be FIRED by “Concast” (NBC) for this fraud. He knew exactly what he was doing. Public Airwaves = Fake News! @AjitPaiFCC @FCC https://t.co/fLTDhjMXo4 The clip from Barr’s interview was shown as part of a question during a panel discussion about the Flynn case. Todd teed up his question for Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan after NBC News reporter Kristen Welker, another panelist, mentioned the attorney general. ""I want you to listen to this Bill Barr answer to a question about what will history say about this,"" Todd said. ""Wait until you hear this answer. Take a listen."" The tape rolled, showing Herridge asking Barr what the impression will be ""when history looks back on this decision"" to recommend the dismissal of Flynn’s charges. ""Well, history is written by the winners,"" Barr said in response. ""So it largely depends on who’s writing the history."" That’s where the clip stopped.  At that point, Todd said he was struck ""by the cynicism"" of Barr’s answer. ""It's a correct answer,"" he said. ""But he's the attorney general. He didn't make the case that he was upholding the rule of law. He was almost admitting that, yeah, this is a political job.""  But had the tape kept rolling, viewers would have seen that Barr did insist that he was upholding the rule of law. In fact, he used those exact words. Here’s his full quote, with the relevant portion in bold: ""Well, history is written by the winners. So it largely depends on who's writing the history. But I think a fair history would say it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law, it upheld the standards of the Department of Justice, and it undid what was an injustice.""  Kupec said on Twitter that Barr made similar points elsewhere in the interview. For example, when asked if he was doing Trump’s bidding by altering the course of the Flynn case, Barr said, ""No, I’m doing the law’s bidding. I’m doing my duty under the law, as I see it."" For its part, ""CBS Evening News"" also trimmed the clip of Barr in the same fashion during its May 7 TV broadcast, cutting his quote after ""winners."" Norah O’Donnell, the show’s anchor, didn’t claim that Barr never said he was upholding the law, as Todd did. ""CBS This Morning"" presented the clip in its full context May 8. Todd said Barr ""didn’t make the case that he was upholding the rule of law"" with regard to Flynn during an interview with CBS News. ""Meet the Press"" did not show the attorney general’s complete remarks.  After saying that ""history is written by the winners,"" Barr said, ""I think a fair history would say it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law."" We rate Todd’s statement False. UPDATE, May 13, 2020: Todd apologized for the error during the May 12 edition of MSNBC’s ""Meet the Press Daily.""

They saw only the ""CBS Evening News"" version of the clip, and they did not check for a full transcript, he said.

Southwest CEO’s boast about airplanes’ low COVID risk overlooks key concerns
","During an appearance on ""Face the Nation,"" Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said that he believed it was safe for Americans to fly during the coronavirus epidemic and that a plane is as safe as any other space. ""I don’t think the risk on an airplane is any greater risk than anywhere else, and in fact, you just look at the layered approach that we use. It’s as safe as an environment as you’re going to find,"" said Kelly.  We thought it was important to check this claim. After all, as states lift stay-at-home orders and summer weather starts to roll in, Americans are bound to start thinking about travel and whether it’s safe to fly in the COVID age.  We contacted Southwest Airlines to ask for the evidence to back up Kelly’s claim. A company spokesperson pointed us to this statement -- the Southwest Promise – which outlines steps taken by the airline to protect employees and customers from COVID-19. The spokesperson also said that all of Southwest’s flights are equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which also are used in hospitals to provide patients with clean air.  All in all, it seems Kelly has some valid points about the safety of airplanes right now. But he also overplayed his hand. So, how might someone contract COVID-19 on a plane?  As with any setting that holds many people at the same time, there is a risk of virus transmission through the air as well as from high-touch surfaces. On an airplane, that could be a bathroom door handle. And it is easy to picture how this risk can be amplified on a long flight with other travelers. Case studies have shown that disease transmission occurs on flights. In 2003, for instance, 16 people tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS – a coronavirus closely related to COVID, after flying on a plane with a symptomatic passenger. The H1N1 virus, or swine flu, has also been documented as having spread between plane passengers. COVID-specific research is ongoing. There are specific issues concerning air travel. Qingyan Chen, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University who led Federal Aviation Administration-sponsored research examining infectious disease transmission on airplanes, said his team focused on certain specific ways an illness could spread on an aircraft: by direct contact with sick person, and by inhaling large droplets or aerosols expelled from a sick person.   Large droplets are caused by forcing air out of your mouth, such as by breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing. A lot of the droplets are too large to stay airborne long, while others are very small and can stay airborne for hours. The small droplets are called aerosols.  Though the air in an airplane is highly circulated, Chen said aerosols can still hang in the air for about three to four minutes before being sucked up by the ventilation system. Aerosols ""can be really dangerous. They have the highest risk,"" said Chen. ""The small droplets can get to the seven rows around a sick passenger within four minutes."" However, Chen was quick to point out that his studies were focused on other airborne diseases, like flu, tuberculosis and SARS.  Airlines maintain that there is little evidence that COVID-19 transmission has occurred on planes and that their ventilation systems are 99.9% effective at filtering out microscopic particles. There are also studies that suggest aerosols have a more limited reach, just two seats laterally and one row in front of and one row behind an infectious passenger. The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines from 120 countries, sent us details of a May 5 presentation by the group’s medical adviser in which he referred to three ""studies"" — actually two academic journal research letters and a news article — that showed little or no transmission of COVID-19 on flights that contained passengers who had the coronavirus.  One of the letters, though, discussed a case in which a person flew from the Central African Republic to France and ""likely got infected on the plane.""    ""The research that’s been done over the years is that there’s really not any significant difference in what you would have in a building such as we’re sitting in today, in terms of air quality,"" FAA chief Steve Dickson said at a March Capitol Hill hearing.  Airlines for America, a U.S.-focused industry trade group, said the industry is ""taking substantial, proactive steps to protect passengers and employees,"" including requiring that passengers and employees wear masks, implementing intensive cleaning protocols and changing policies such as the boarding of passengers from back to front and the reduced frequency of food and beverage services. (Kelly is on the board of directors for Airlines for America.) But is that enough to justify Kelly’s statement that airplanes are as safe as just about any other environment? Not really.     The key difference is that you are able to make decisions about how much space to put between yourself and other people in almost all other locations, said Karen Hoffmann, the immediate past president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.  ""There are levels of what you can and can’t do in an airplane,"" said Hoffmann. ""If you’re in your home, you can maintain no one else coming into your space. In the grocery store you can walk away from other people.""   Chen agreed. ""In offices, you have ample space to stay far apart and keep your social distancing,"" he said. ""But in the airplane, you cannot keep your social distance or else the airliners will not be profitable.""  How do the infection-transmission risks of airplanes hold up in comparison with other modes of mass transportation? ""Compared to more cramped and less ventilated settings like subways and buses, the risks of getting sick on an airplane are lower overall — though you still face risk from whatever infections the people in your row may be carrying,"" wrote Rachel Vreeman in an email. She is the director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine.  But the research on this comparison predates COVID-19 and the impact of social distancing. The longer average length of time passengers spend on airplanes versus mass transit could also make it less safe, Vreeman added.    With all of those factors taken into account, Kelly’s statement unravels.  Is an airplane potentially carrying an infectious passenger safer than your own home, where the only contact with a stranger you have is grabbing the takeout dinner order left on your porch by a delivery person? Clearly not.  It’s clear that airlines do carry a transmission risk for illnesses like COVID-19, especially if you end up seated close to an infectious person. And people have less control over social distancing on airplanes than in other spaces.  Overall, Chen said he thought it could be reasonably safe as long as every passenger and crew member wore a mask. He also suggested that passengers wipe down the surfaces around them and wash their hands, but said there would still be a risk.  In late April, unions representing pilots and flight attendants sent letters to the U.S. Transportation Department , the Department of Health and Human Services, Congress and the White House detailing the risks faced by airline workers — as well as the number of infections and even deaths they have suffered — and urging increased safety protections. Shortly after, most major U.S. airlines, including JetBlue, Frontier, American, Delta, United and Southwest, announced they would now require customers to wear face masks during check-in and boarding, in flight and while deplaning.  Hoffmann said that for a flight to be safe it would be crucial for social distancing rules to be in place, such as blocking out seats to space out travelers.  ""Can you maintain that level of separation in an airplane?"" she asked. ""I question whether that is something which can be accomplished.""  Delta has started blocking out its middle seats. Some airlines are blocking the seats near where the flight attendants sit. United is not allowing customers to select seats next to each other or the middle seats. Both Southwest and JetBlue have said they will limit the number of passengers to ensure space between them.  Vreeman pointed out, though, that there are times on an airplane or in an airport where it might be impossible to maintain the appropriate distance from others. ""When someone is walking in the aisle to the bathroom, for example, you might be stuck in close proximity — and that would increase the risks to both of you,"" she wrote.   And while all major U.S. airlines have announced increased efforts to disinfect and sanitize planes and eliminate or reduce food and beverage service, there is still a danger.   ""Any time you are removing your mask or putting anything in your mouth, the risk of transmitting or being exposed to the virus will be higher,"" wrote Vreeman. And, Vreeman argued, we are still in the containment stage of the pandemic, which means moving from one place to another is itself a public health risk.   ""At this moment in American history, it is still very possible that someone infected with this very contagious virus could be in that space on the airplane with you — or that you could be carrying the virus yourself to a new location,"" she wrote.   The CEO of Southwest Airlines said during a TV interview that the risks of COVID-19 transmission on an airplane are no greater than anywhere else and that ""it’s as safe as an environment as you’re going to find.""  Research shows that airplanes’ strong ventilation systems do filter out virus particles. However, studies also indicate that some level of risk regarding the transmission of an infectious disease persists, particularly if you are seated near a contagious person. And passengers’ ability to take steps to mitigate that risk is limited.   Kelly’s statement contained an element of truth regarding planes’ air filtration and mitigation steps taken by the industry, but he took it a bit too far and left out key pieces of information and context.  We rate it as Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809719B400>],/factchecks/2020/may/11/gary-kelly/southwest-ceos-boast-about-airplanes-low-covid-ris/

Pelosi exaggerates former Republican governor’s role in Illinois’ fiscal distress
","President Donald Trump frequently cites Illinois’ fiscal mismanagement as a reason for potentially withholding federal assistance amid the national crisis caused by the outbreak of COVID-19. In a May 4 interview with CNN, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shot back with her own assessment of Illinois’ financial straits. ""Look at him saying these states want to be bailed out,"" Pelosi told host Wolf Blitzer. ""The state that he used as an example was Illinois, which got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there until Gov. Pritzker has come to pull it out."" The National Governors Association sent a bipartisan letter to Congress in April that made clear the financial pressure caused by COVID-19 is being felt by states nationwide, not just in blue states as Trump has said. But what about Pelosi’s assessment of how Illinois got itself into a financial bind? Her comment suggests Illinois’ hardships are a matter of recent history, dating back just a few years to the time of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Republican predecessor. State finance experts say that’s misleading. Understanding what Pelosi was referencing requires a brief detour into recent state history. In November 2014, Illinoisans elected Republican Bruce Rauner as governor. Rauner, a private equity investor and political newcomer, reached an impasse with Democrats who control the legislature over how to run the state. This left Illinois without a spending plan for two years. With government spending left operating largely on autopilot, social services suffered, public universities laid off thousands of employees and the state’s pile of unpaid bills tripled, causing credit rating agencies to reduce Illinois’ rating to near-junk status. As the state’s chief executive, Rauner played a starring role in the showdown that caused the budget crisis. But he had plenty of co-stars among the state’s leading Democrats, including longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan, who has exerted influence over every state budget for the past four decades. Democratic leadership also allowed a temporary state income tax increase to expire days before Rauner was sworn into office in 2015, leaving the state with even less cash to make ends meet during the crisis. Rauner had urged the legislature to let it lapse before taking office, and Madigan along with then Senate President John Cullerton obliged despite warnings from then Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who lost to Rauner in 2014. Foisting all the blame for the state’s unprecedented budget crisis on Rauner isn’t the only problem with Pelosi’s narrative. That’s because the tale of how Illinois dug itself into a fiscal hole dates back much further than his single term in office. When we raised this with Pelosi’s office, a spokesman responded with an email saying she was ""clearly referencing the fact that Illinois’ situation greatly worsened"" under Rauner — not that he alone was responsible for the state’s fiscal woes. But experts interpreted her statement differently. ""To claim that this is a problem created by Gov. Rauner is clearly misleading,"" said David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs. ""It's a problem that's developed over decades."" Illinois governors and lawmakers from both parties have long managed to increase government spending without raising the revenue needed to support it. ""For many, many years we’ve provided more goods and services … than our revenues would support,"" said Charles N. Wheeler III, who has studied decades of state budgets as both a journalist and professor at the University of Illinois Springfield. ""It’s always easier for lawmakers to fund programs than it is to raise the revenues to cover it."" Indeed, the alarm bells began sounding long before Rauner took office. A 2011 report from the state comptroller’s office warned of a looming financial crisis created by many years of rampant spending. The report cautioned that the recession at the time had exacerbated the state’s ongoing failures to reduce its debt, build up its emergency reserves, or contribute enough to state employee pension funds. And when it comes to pensions, Illinois’ problems date back even further. In 1917, a report commissioned by the General Assembly was already warning the funds were ""moving toward crisis"" due to inadequate payments from the state. ""We’ve been shortchanging the pensions for more than a hundred years,"" Wheeler said. Pelosi said Illinois ""got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there"" before Pritzker. Illinois’ financial situation did worsen during Rauner's term while the state operated without a spending plan for an unprecedented two years, but he wasn’t solely to blame. What’s more, the state was already teetering on the brink when he took office because of decisions made by leaders from both parties dating back decades. We rate Pelosi’s claim Mostly False.

Evidence lacking that cats eaten as COVID-19 cure
","Cats and dogs have long been a controversial part of the cuisine for some in Vietnam. But a new claim circulating online says that people there are eating black cats as a treatment for COVID-19. Tabloid news sites including the Toronto Sun, the New York Post, the U.S. Sun and Vietnam Insider published stories saying black cats are being ""collected, killed and their bodies ground up as a supposed coronavirus treatment."" Each of the stories in some way attributed its information to the South West News Service, which describes itself as a ""UK- and US-based news and media content agency with a proud 40-year history.""

With fewer than 300 reported cases and zero deaths, Vietnam has been highlighted for its response to COVID-19, which included strict quarantining and intensive testing. Much of the country has reopened, with children returning to school May 4. While Vietnam has grappled with real issues related to animal welfare, experts we spoke to say they haven’t found widespread evidence that black cats are being killed and turned into a paste to treat COVID-19. The news service that generated the story said it has removed the article from circulation amid concerns about its credibility. Here’s what we know. On April 17, The Sun, a tabloid in the United Kingdom and Ireland, published a story that reported on an investigation by an animal rights group called Four Paws. According to the story, the group said it examined dining app data and found that dog and cat meat sales were surging through dining app delivery services in Cambodia and Vietnam. The story surmised that ""doctors in the region are encouraging many to eat dog and cat meat, claiming its properties help fight off viruses."" A week later, on April 23 and 24, stories credited to the South West News Service were published elsewhere that had a similar storyline, but took the claim further to suggest black cats are being singled out, turned into paste and consumed as medicine.  Pictures credited to South West News Service accompanied some versions of the online stories. But the captions were vague and the images hard to verify. They included, for example, a photo of a baby drinking from a bottle that appears to contain a black substance. ""This distressing image shows a baby reportedly being fed the black cat concoction,"" the caption said. The stories’ only source appeared to be the head of another charity, No to Dog Meat, based in London. We reached out to that group for evidence. They sent us to their YouTube account which includes four videos uploaded in April and May that claim in captions or titles to show cat mistreatment in Vietnam but which included no verifiable information about exactly where or when they were taken. Asked about the black cat claim, Cat Besch, founder and director of Hanoi-based Vietnam Animal Aid & Rescue, told PolitiFact she has seen ""zero evidence in Vietnam so far that this is true."" Nam Nguyen, an editor in Vietnam with the government-run Vietnam News Agency, told PolitiFact ""the rumor has been around these weeks and originated from one post in Thailand social media, but as far as I know, Vietnamese are not so superstitious like other nations in southeast Asia to practice those ancient rites."" He said the post has been deleted. Phuong Tham, director of Human Society International in Vietnam, told PolitiFact that black cats are being killed there ""by people with lack of knowledge, believing that black cats' bones can treat asthma in children, while others kill them for superstitious beliefs,"" but ""we have seen no evidence that black cats in Vietnam are being killed for COVID-19 treatment."" Tham and Dr. Todd Pollack, Harvard University medical professor and country director in Hanoi of the Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam, said it is significant that they had not seen the claim reported by news organizations in Vietnam. VN Express, a newspaper in Vietnam, reported that on May 6, police in Nghe An province seized 630 kilograms of dog, cat carcasses and entrails of other animals from a passenger bus. The driver said the meat was being taken to Hanoi for consumption, according to the report. But the report contains no suggestion the meat was being used for treatment of coronavirus. When we reached out to South West News Service about the source of the information, the agency told PolitiFact that ""shortly after publication, we identified a number of issues with this story and pulled it from our service. We received new information which led us to doubt the widespread nature of the claims the charity had made on this issue.""

Worries for restaurant owners are real, but post saying Georgia Gov. mandated reopening goes too far
","Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to reopen many businesses sparked a social media dress-down from a restaurant owner in the Atlanta area. John Gianoulidis, owner of the Kafenio Greek Diner, said Kemp’s order will hurt small businesses. ""Kemp mandates restaurants reopen, whether I reopen dining rooms or not. I file for business interruption insurance, it does not go through since I am ‘allowed’ to operate full capacity,"" he wrote in an April 20 Facebook post that has been reshared thousands of times and drew national media attention. The owner then described a series of problems he faces, including that he still has the pressures to pay rent and unemployment insurance. ""Guys, this is about screwing the working class and small business, not about helping us,"" he wrote. A Facebook post that repeated the restaurant owner’s post without identifying him was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Exactly what happens for any business owner’s unemployment insurance and rent is difficult to fact-check, because those are based on private contractual arrangements. The full impact on restaurants won’t be known for months, if not longer. But we can fact-check if Kemp mandated restaurants to reopen. ""I’ve had people take me to task for the usage of the word mandate,"" Gianoulidis told PolitiFact in an email. Kemp’s order said that restaurants ""are hereby permitted to resume providing dine-in services"" as of April 27. The order includes 39 restrictions, including that restaurant workers must wear face masks, limit the number of patrons, and discontinue salad bars and buffets.  In other words, restaurants are allowed to reopen, as long as they follow the rules, but they are not required to. Restaurants still have a choice.  Still, the hardships faced by restaurant owners like Gianouidis are real. Georgia processed about 1.4 million unemployment claims from March 16 to April 25. Roughly 30% were from the food and hospitality sector, state labor data show. Industry data show that as of May 6 around 31% of restaurants have reopened their dining rooms, said Karen Bremer, CEO of the Georgia Restaurant Association.  Whether it’s feasible for a restaurant to reopen under the 39 conditions depends on the size of the restaurant since seating is limited. The profit margin for a restaurant is between 4 and 6 percent, which means ""if your sales are off by 50%, you are paying to be open to take care of customers and employ people. You are burning cash to do it,"" Bremer said. Restaurants face a series of challenges to reopen. Former restaurant workers collecting unemployment may not want to come back. It’s harder to buy meat amid shortages. It takes time to empty kitchens of expired food.  Following Kemp’s decision, more than 120 Atlanta restaurants announced they would not reopen their dining rooms due to health and safety concerns, though many are offering takeout. Gianoulidis said Kafenio Avondale is open only for takeout/delivery while his College Park location has remained closed.  Gianoulidis told PolitiFact that the cost and hassle of reopening the dining room following all of the protocols ""is not worth the risk or cost."" ""At least 80% of my customers now are not wearing masks and acting like it is all over,"" he told PolitiFact. ""It seems like since people are tired of being careful, most just gave up and are making believe there is nothing wrong."" Gianoulidis said that his claim under business interruption insurance was denied. Multiple lawsuits have been filed by restaurants and other businesses or nonprofits against insurers that say claims for business interruption insurance policies were wrongly denied. The insurance industry argues that policies were not designed to provide coverage against diseases such as COVID-19. ""Pandemics are not generally covered by business interruption,"" said Lauren Anderson, spokeswoman for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. ""Most standard policies list pandemics as an exclusion."" Bremer, with the Georgia Restaurant Association, said that the majority of restaurant owners she has spoken to have had their claims denied for business interruption insurance. She said after previous viruses in past years, more policies added virus exclusions. She has told owners to file claims anyway. But even claims under policies without exclusions for viruses are being denied, said lawyer John Houghtaling. In addition to his Georgia clients, Houghtaling is the lawyer for the Business Interruption Group, which was formed by some of the nation’s top chefs to help businesses that have been denied insurance claims.  The insurance ""industry is taking a completely universal approach regardless of what the policy says,"" he told PolitiFact.  Gianoulidis wrote in a Facebook post that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp ""mandates restaurants reopen."" Kemp’s order didn’t force restaurants to reopen, but it allowed them to reopen as long as they follow 39 conditions. Many have determined that they will not open their dining rooms, due to health, safety or financial reasons. The challenges and pain faced by restaurant owners is real, but the specific claim about Kemp’s order mandating restaurants to reopen is wrong. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC8400>],/factchecks/2020/may/08/facebook-posts/worries-restaurant-owners-are-real-post-saying-geo/

Central Park field hospital treated coronavirus patients, not abused children
","As the early epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, New York City scrambled to expand its hospital capacity.  The Navy hospital ship traveled to New York to relieve the pressure on hospitals; the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was converted into a 4,000-bed medical center; and a field hospital was set up in Central Park. The Central Park tent hospital, operated by Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian group run by the son of late televangelist Billy Graham, has since become the focus of online conspiracy theories. ""Thousands of babies and children are being brought up out of underground tunnels in New York's Central Park by military personal (sic), during the night and placed in tents brought in by Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse,"" one Facebook post says, in all capital letters. The children, it adds, have been captive underground since birth, subjected to torture and ""kept as sex slaves."" There is absolutely no evidence of this. A 68-bed field hospital was set up in Central Park in April to help overwhelmed hospitals treat patients with COVID-19. The hospital was made up of 14 tents used primarily for diagnosis, treatment and storage. When it first began operating, it had 10 ventilators and treated patients from Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York’s Queens and Brooklyn boroughs.  Beginning April 1, an organization known as Samaritan’s Purse, working with Mount Sinai, treated nearly 200 coronavirus patients in the Central Park field hospital. The facility operated until May 5, and ""all patients under Samaritan’s Purse care"" have since been discharged, according to its website. Samaritan’s Purse said there is no truth to the claims about abused children being treated there.  ""These are totally false rumors,"" Kaitlyn Lahm, a Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson, said in a statement to PolitiFact.  ""We worked hand-in-hand with Mount Sinai Hospital to bring desperately needed surge capacity,"" she said. ""All patients treated at the Emergency Field Hospital were transferred from Mount Sinai to Samaritan’s Purse."" News outlets including VICE and the Associated Press have investigated the origin of the claims and linked the conspiracies to the group QAnon and its followers.  QAnon ""centers on the baseless belief that (President Donald) Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the ‘deep state’ and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals,"" according to AP reports. A post claims, ""Thousands of babies and children are being brought up out of underground tunnels in New York's Central Park by military personal (sic), during the night and placed in tents brought in by Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse.""  The Central Park hospital treated coronavirus patients. There is no evidence to support the claim that it housed abused children released from captivity. It appears the claim originated with the QAnon conspiracy group.

"['Texas', 'Coronavirus', 'Greg Abbott']","
Recovery data on coronavirus is lacking
","Ahead of his announcement that Texas would commence the second phase of its reopening after a statewide stay-at-home order had lifted, Gov. Greg Abbott celebrated ""GREAT NEWS"" for the state in a tweet. ""The number of Texans who have RECOVERED from #COVID19 now exceeds the number of active COVID cases for the past 2 days,"" Abbott said. ""That’s exactly what we want to see. Texas ranks 3rd highest among states for number of people who have recovered from #coronavirus."" Abbott had announced that he would allow the statewide stay-at-home order he issued on April 2 to expire on the last day of April, allowing retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters and malls to open, with limited capacity, on May 1. At the time, Abbott said he would commence the second phase of his reopening plan by May 18, assuming there was no secondary ""flare-up"" of COVID-19 cases in the state. But on Tuesday, Abbott said coronavirus metrics for the state signaled that it would be appropriate to start the second phase of his plan ahead of schedule, allowing barbershops, and hair, nail and tanning salons to open at limited capacity later in the week. Ahead of his this announcement, Abbott shared the statement we’re checking and said Texas is the third highest in the nation for the number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus. But what does that number mean? Recovery statistics are not a factor that indicate a state’s readiness to reopen, according to guidelines from the White House. The guidelines, released in April, highlight certain criteria states should meet before opening: a downward trajectory of COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms, a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests and a robust testing program for healthcare workers, including antibody testing. The number of recoveries is also not a metric used to calculate the prevalence (current cases) or incidence (new cases) of an infectious disease, according to Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s School of Medicine. ""Recovery, even if it were measured properly, does not reflect interventions because we have almost none,"" Cohen said. ""Such statistics are generally used to measure the success of a health care system when testing and treatments might be robust."" Examining recoveries The raw counts of recovered cases available show that Texas does rank third, but there is a lot to unpack with this data. Abbott’s office did not return a request for comment seeking information about the data behind his statement. The main difficulty in weighing the statement is the quality of the data on recoveries. Fourteen states do not have current recovery data recorded by the COVID Tracking Project, an organization launched by The Atlantic that collects and publishes data from each state’s health agencies on the virus. The group’s website warns that data on patient outcomes, including hospitalizations, deaths and recoveries is ""less consistently reported"" than other data, like the number of tests administered. A visit to the website of each of these 14 states’ health authorities did not turn up any data on recoveries. There are also different definitions for what it means to have recovered from COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has offered guidance on this front, but says that states and local health authorities can adapt the guidance as needed. The guidance outlines different standards, based on whether an individual has tested positive for the virus and whether the person is displaying symptoms. It also depends on whether a person is caring for themselves at home or has been in the care of a physician. A person without symptoms can discontinue isolation, as long as at least 10 days have passed since first testing positive for COVID-19 and the individual did not later develop symptoms. In cases where symptoms are present, it depends on when the person last had a fever and when symptoms show signs of letting up. In places with ample testing supplies, the CDC recommends a ""test-based strategy"" for assessing whether a person is still sick. In Texas, the number of patients recorded as recovered is an estimate ""based on several assumptions related to hospitalization rates and recovery times, which were informed by data available to date. These assumptions are subject to change as we learn more about COVID-19,"" according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard. But even using the limited data available, there is also the size of the state’s population to consider. Given that Texas is the second most populous state, it makes more sense to consider the rate of recovery by state — the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 relative to the total number of those infected — than the total number of recoveries. Looking at the numbers When Abbott shared this tweet on May 4, the latest coronavirus figures from Texas were as follows: 407,398 tests administered with 32,332 positive results, 884 deaths and 16,090 recoveries. Looking just at the cumulative number of recoveries at this date, Texas ranks third among all 37 states and Washington D.C. that have statewide recovery data available. New York recorded the most recoveries, with 58,950, followed by Louisiana, with 20,316. New York has reported far more cumulative coronavirus cases than any other state (318,953 as of May 4), and Louisiana has been a hot spot for the virus, although it has reported fewer cases than Texas. In March, Abbott instituted a mandatory quarantine order for travelers arriving in the state from various coronavirus hot spots, including New York and Louisiana. At the end of April, Abbott removed Louisiana from the list.  Travelers from California, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Washington and the cities of Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit and Miami are still required to self-quarantine for two weeks upon their arrival in Texas. Recovery rate At the time of Abbott’s claim, nearly half of all people who tested positive for coronavirus had been reported as recovered — a recovery rate of 49.76%. Using this figure to compare across the 37 states and Washington D.C. that have recovery data, Texas ranks 16th using this measure. Montana has the highest recovery rate, as more than 88% of the 457 people who tested positive have been reported as recovered. Our ruling Abbott said Texas ranks third among states for the number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus. The available figures on cumulative COVID-19 recoveries by state show that Texas ranks third — but that data has limitations. For one, just 37 states and Washington D.C. have been recording data on recoveries. Also, different standards are in place for determining whether a patient has recovered. In Texas, the statewide figure for recoveries is an estimate based on hospitalization data. Plus, a better metric for comparison is the recovery rate of the virus, given Texas’ population size. Using this measure, Texas ranks 16th among those states with data. Abbott’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BCB440>],/factchecks/2020/may/08/greg-abbott/recovery-data-coronavirus-lacking/

In era of low gas prices, New York remains among most expensive in U.S.
","With the coronavirus pandemic sending automobile miles plummeting — and with it, demand for gasoline — Americans are finding prices at the pump to be lower than they’ve been in years. But New York state remains on the higher end of that range. That’s what WKBW-TV, Buffalo’s ABC affiliate, reported on April 27, citing the American Automobile Association. ""New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00, according to numbers provided by the AAA of Western and Central New York,"" the report said. Is that correct? Yes. We asked AAA for the gas price data for April 27, and they provided us with the full list of 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The data comes from surveys of up to 120,000 gas stations across the country. We looked at the price per gallon for unleaded regular. Here’s the list of states, from most expensive to least expensive:   According to this list, New York, at $2.18 a gallon, was the seventh most expensive state for gasoline, trailing Hawaii, California, Washington state, Oregon, Nevada, and the District of Columbia. (D.C. isn’t a state, but we’ll grant some leeway.) The other five states with gas prices above $2.00 were Arizona, Pennsylvania, Utah, Alaska, and New Jersey. That adds up to 12 states above $2.00, as the statement said, as long as you include D.C. as a state. Three states had gas below $1.40 a gallon: Ohio, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. AAA isn’t the only source of this data. We also looked at data from the wesbite GasBuddy. GasBuddy sent us their own state-by-state prices from April 27 and it shows a similar pattern, but slightly different due to data sampling. New York, at $2.13, was one of eight states with gas prices above $2.00. In descending order, they were Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington state, Nevada, New York, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. That’s fewer than the 12 states that AAA found with $2.00-plus gasoline, but four additional states on the GasBuddy list had prices just under $2.00. Utah, Alaska, the District of Columbia, and New Jersey all had gas prices at between $1.95 and $1.95. One reason why gas prices are relatively high in New York is the tax burden, according to an interactive map produced by the American Petroleum Institute.  In 2018, New Yorkers paid more than 45 cents a gallon in state taxes and 18 cents a gallon in federal taxes, for a total of 63 cents a gallon. That’s nearly twice what Ohio motorists pay in taxes. New York is one of just a handful of states where motorists pay more than 49 cents a gallon in gasoline taxes.  Since the article appeared, the situation hasn’t changed much. By the following week, only 10 states had average gas prices above $2.00 per gallon, and New York remained one of them. With some states beginning to re-open portions of their economies, gasoline prices have increased slightly in some states, according to AAA and GasBuddy data. But the average price per gallon in the United States had only risen a couple of cents per gallon, In New York, the changes were also minimal. AAA had New York’s average price per gallon at $2.15, while GasBuddy had a slightly lower price, $2.12.  A news report cited the American Automobile Association in saying that ""New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00."" AAA provided us the full data, confirming that the statement is correct, as long as the District of Columbia is counted as a state. Among the 50 states and D.C., New York ranked seventh highest in per-gallon prices for regular unleaded. Another gasoline price metric, from GasBuddy, had eight states above $2.00, with four additional states between $1.95 and $1.99.

No evidence that Mandy Cohen threatened to withhold PPE from NC hospitals
","A North Carolina legislator claims that the state health department threatened to withhold equipment from hospitals if they resumed elective procedures. But the health department has denied the claim, and PolitiFact could not confirm that the ultimatum was ever seriously considered or even communicated to hospitals. Mandy Cohen, secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services, requested on March 23 that hospitals suspend non-urgent procedures. The goal was to prevent unnecessary human contact, ensure COVID-19 patients got the care they needed, and preserve the state’s limited supply of protective equipment.  At the same time, halting elective procedures meant hospitals lost out on revenue generated from those procedures. So it makes sense that they’d want to resume them. This is where state Senator Warren Daniel comes in. Daniel, a Republican from western North Carolina, tweeted on April 23 that hospitals might be punished if they choose to resume those procedures. ""It’s being reported that NC DHHS is telling hospitals that if they decide to do elective surgeries, they won’t be eligible to receive PPE from the state,"" Daniel tweeted, referring to personal protective equipment. He suggested the alleged threat was contrived by Cohen. Aside from Gov. Roy Cooper, Cohen has been perhaps the state’s most visible government official during the pandemic. Daniel referred to the decision as ""The heavy hand of government,"" adding: ""I hope Secretary Cohen will reverse course."" When PolitiFact reached out to Daniel, he said he got the information from the N.C. Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals across the state. Daniel said the association ""reported to legislators last week that DHHS told them if hospitals began offering elective surgeries again, then the state would not give them additional PPE."" He added: ""When I heard that I was shocked and thought it was something the public deserved to know."" We reached out to the NC Healthcare Association and were referred to Leah Burns, the group’s senior director of government relations. ""I had a conversation with a staffer at DHHS where this notion was discussed that PPE would potentially be withheld from hospitals if hospitals began elective surgeries,"" Burns said. She declined to identify the DHHS staffer she spoke with. ""After my conversation with the DHHS staffer, I spoke with a legislative staffer about it. Since then, this idea has not come to fruition, and I do not believe DHHS is withholding PPE from any hospitals in North Carolina,"" Burns said. She declined to identify the legislative staffer she spoke with. Eight days after Daniel’s tweet, on May 1, DHHS offered guidance to hospitals on how they could resume elective procedures. That letter mentions the lack of PPE across the state, stating: ""If appropriate PPE is unavailable to protect the health care worker or the supply of appropriate PPE is limited, then the non-time sensitive surgery or procedure should be cancelled."" But the letter doesn’t say hospitals would be cut off from resources if they didn’t obey the guidelines.  When we asked DHHS about Daniel’s tweet, spokeswoman Amy Ellis denied his claim. ""That is false. Secretary Cohen did not say that,"" Ellis said in an email and referred us back to the hospital Association. When we relayed what Burns said, Ellis suggested someone got confused about the department’s plans. ""Secretary Cohen has never indicated that,"" she said. ""Conversations between staffers can easily be misunderstood."" Since Daniel posted his tweet, several North Carolina hospitals announced plans to resume some elective procedures. PolitiFact reached out to several hospital systems to see if DHHS threatened to withhold PPE. ""I’m told that’s not true,"" said Alan Wolf, spokesman for the UNC Health System. He added that UNC Health leaders and providers are growing concerned about further delays in care for some patients. UNC Health has been doing less than half its usual volume of procedures and will probably increase it to 65% to 75%, Linda Butler, the system’s chief medical officer, recently told the News & Observer. Duke Health didn’t receive any correspondence from DHHS indicating the department might withhold PPE, said Sarah Avery, director of Duke’s Health News Office. ""Duke Health hospitals received a letter May 1 from the secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Mandy Cohen, notifying us that the elective and non-urgent procedures and surgeries can be resumed in accordance with guidance developed by the North Carolina Healthcare Association (NCHA),"" Avery said.  Novant and Wake Forest Baptist hospitals also plan to resume elective procedures, according to the Winston-Salem Journal. PolitiFact called and emailed those health systems, but neither responded to questions about Daniel’s claim. Sen. Daniel tweeted: ""It’s being reported that NC DHHS is telling hospitals that if they decide to do elective surgeries, they won’t be eligible to receive PPE from the state."" Let’s break that down. The only ""report"" Daniel cited -- and the only report PolitiFact could track down -- was a conversation between a DHHS staffer and a representative for the North Carolina Healthcare Association. DHHS denied that the staffer said what the association’s representative claimed, describing their conversation as a misunderstanding.  Daniel said ""DHHS is telling hospitals"" about the conditions for receiving PPE. But hospitals who spoke to PolitiFact said they were never given the alleged ultimatum.  Daniel’s tweet also tied the ultimatum to secretary Cohen. But, in her email to PolitiFact, the association’s representative didn’t tie the ""notion"" to Cohen, and we couldn’t find any other evidence that DHHS threatened to withhold PPE from hospitals that resumed elective surgeries.  This leaves us with a he said-she said situation about a claim that never came to fruition. Given Daniel’s claim lacks evidence, we rate it false.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AAE5C0>],/factchecks/2020/may/08/warren-daniel/no-evidence-mandy-cohen-threatened-withhold-ppe-nc/

GOP State Senate candidate is off base with claim that Wisconsin governor ‘never had a real job’
","The pushback against Gov. Tony Evers’ safer-at-home order aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus has included a lawsuit filed by Republican leaders and rallies at the Capitol. One such gathering, an Open Wisconsin rally on April 24, 2020, attracted about 1,500 people according to Capitol police.  Among them: former state Rep. Don Pridemore, R-Hartford. Pridemore told Shawn Johnson, State Capitol Bureau chief for Wisconsin Public Radio, that he is aiming to launch a recall effort against Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. On his Twitter account, Johnson quoted Pridemore saying he was at the rally to ""wake Tony Evers up. Tony Evers has been in an ivory tower all his life. He's never had a real job."" In a recording of the interview shared with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Pridemore can be heard expanding on the ""never had a real job"" comment by saying that ""without that experience, (Evers) doesn’t know how the people are suffering with this stay-at-home business."" There is some bluster and hyperbole here, of course.  But what about Pridemore’s starkest claim? Is it true Evers has ""never had a real job""? Attempts to reach Pridemore via telephone and email to request back up for his claim were unsuccessful. In the past, Pridemore has refused to speak with journalists from certain media outlets, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  Pridemore has said he will run to replace state Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. Fitzgerald is running to replace U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who is retiring at the end of his term. It is also worth noting that Pridemore ran for the position of Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction in April 2013 and was defeated by Evers, who held the post at the time. Evers’ spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff chided Pridemore for not being more familiar with the governor’s background ""considering he lost an election for state superintendent by more than 20 points to then-Supt. Evers back in 2013."" Evers had been in that post since July 2009. It’s fair to say this position is probably what Pridemore was referring to as being in an ""ivory tower."" And, while elected officials work, it’s fair to say most people don’t think of elected positions as everyday, run-of-the-mill jobs. So, what else has Evers done? Baldauff said Evers’ first job was ""as a kid, scraping mold off of cheese in his hometown of Plymouth, Wisconsin."" In a Nov. 6, 2018 campaign podcast interview with The Capital Times featuring Republican Gov. Scott Walker and challenger Evers, Evers said:  ""I worked in three separate cheese factories in Plymouth, and my high-level job was scraping mold off of cheese.""  (For those now raising their eyebrows: scraping mold from cheese was indeed a job decades ago.)   John Umhoefer, executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association, said the governor is describing a job he had about 50 years ago, and yes, it is quite reasonable to state that people were employed in that era to trim cheese blocks and wheels prior to further processing.
  ""The cheese industry is quite different than it was around 1970, including major improvements in packaging systems, packaging films, natural mold inhibitors, and temperature and humidity-controlled storage facilities,"" Umhoefer said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  ""The Governor has described working in facilities that the dairy industry would call converters or processors,"" Umhoefer continued.  ""These facilities hold and process cheese that was made elsewhere.  Often the cheese is cut into chunks, slices, cubes or shreds at a converting company. In 1970, it is believable that cheese blocks and wheels were trimmed (scraped, to use his word) to remove harmless surface molds prior to being cut for consumer use.""  Umhoefer pointed out that ""mold is much less of an issue today with the packaging and storage improvements.""   In addition, Baldauff said, the young adult Evers ""worked as a caregiver in a nursing home."" Most of the governor’s career, Baldauff said, has been in public education, serving as an educator and administrator in school districts around the state (including Tomah, Oakfield, Baraboo, Oshkosh, and Verona). Evers’ biography, according to the Just Facts/Vote Smart website includes these jobs: Former Teacher, Baraboo School District Former Superintendent, Oakfield School District Former Principal, Tomah School District Former Superintendent, Verona School District Deputy State Superintendent, State of Wisconsin, 2001-2009 Chief Administrator, Cooperative Educational Service Agency 6, 1992-2000 Superintendent of Public Instruction, State of Wisconsin, 2009-2019 Governor, State of Wisconsin, 2019-present ""If working to support our dairy industry, caring for our neighbors in long-term care facilities, and educating our kids don’t constitute ‘real jobs’ to Mr. Pridemore, I can’t imagine what does,"" Baldauff said. Pridemore said Evers has ""never had a real job."" It’s probably news to dairy workers that scraping mold from cheese was not considered a real job. Ditto for nursing home caregivers, school teachers and principals. (Elected officials would probably disagree as well). We rate the claim False.

Yes, it’s illegal to hold an election by mail in Wisconsin
","Wisconsin’s pandemic election had some residents and officials searching for an alternative to in-person voting to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. A popular option: Mail-in voting. Gov. Tony Evers called the Republican-controlled legislature into a special session days before the April 7, 2020 election in an effort to convert it to mail only. Local leaders, including Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich echoed that request. As we know, it never happened, and in-person voting occurred despite public health concerns. But Wisconsin will hold two more statewide elections this year, plus a special election for the 7th Congressional District seat on May 12.  Could we do it then? State Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, broached the subject in an April 6, 2020, email to a constituent who wanted lawmakers to postpone the election and move it to mail. The constituent shared the email exchange with PolitiFact Wisconsin, wondering if it was true. ""Some have advocated for moving to an absentee only election or mailing every registered voter in the state a ballot,"" Kapenga wrote. ""Currently, this is illegal."" Is it? Let’s see how Kapenga’s claim rates. When asked for evidence to support Kapenga’s claim, the senator’s office provided an analysis of state statute from the Wisconsin Legislative Council. What does the law say? Wisconsin currently requires elections to be held at polling places — generally a public building — which means those sites need to be open for voting to some extent. Any voter can choose instead to request an absentee ballot and vote by mail, an option more than 1 million voters took advantage of on April 7.  A vote-by-mail election would also be at odds with Wisconsin’s longstanding policy of allowing same-day voter registration at the polls. But conducting an election entirely by mail would require a change to state statute. Even states like Washington that are billed as vote by mail still operate voting centers for people to cast ballots before and on Election Day.  ""Some people with disabilities need to use accessible voting equipment,"" noted Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. State law also says that local clerks must receive a written application from a voter to issue an absentee ballot, so they can’t simply send them to everyone. They can, however, legally mail ballot applications to voters.  The City of Milwaukee took advantage of that allowance and is establishing a program for the fall elections that will mail applications and postage-paid return envelopes to voters, in an effort to prevent lines at polling places.  So, the law is clear: Wisconsin can’t hold an election entirely by mail or send ballots to registered voters.  But whether that remains true for August and November remains to be seen. Democrats have introduced legislation that would move them primarily to mail, though some polling locations would be open for voters who have a disability or struggle to read, write or understand English.  Kapenga told a constituent that it’s currently illegal to hold an absentee-only election or mail ballots to every registered voter. State statute does prohibit both measures as currently written. Lawmakers could change that, but it’s unclear if or when that will happen. We rate Kapenga’s claim True.

Facebook post cites doctors’ widely disputed calculations on COVID-19 death rate
","A call from two California doctors to end statewide shutdowns gained national attention in April, and the eye-popping claims they made about COVID-19’s death rate — while widely disputed by public health experts — are still spreading on Facebook. ""So 2 doctors from Bakersfield discover that coronavirus mortality rate is 0.03%,"" the April 28 Facebook post said. ""13x less deadly than what was previously thought! Their analysis has since been banned from YouTube! Wow!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the doctors, owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, Calif., did not prove the mortality rate for COVID-19 patients is 0.03%.  They pitched a theory that experts said was based on faulty calculations and leading medical associations ""emphatically condemn(ed)"" as ""reckless and untested musings."" Precise fatality rates for any new disease are tough to pin down, especially early in a pandemic. Many mild COVID-19 cases go unreported, making it hard to estimate how many infected individuals have died. Plus, the death toll due to COVID-19 could be higher than we know. Nevertheless, the way the doctors made their calculations was problematic, experts said. The Bakersfield doctors used the infection rate among patients tested at their clinics and in California to extrapolate to the entire state and put the fatality rate for infected individuals at 0.03%. They made the claims in an April 22 press conference broadcast by local news. They said 340 of the 5,213 patients they had tested at their clinics had returned positive results, meaning roughly 6.5% had COVID-19. On the state level, testing data from April 21 showed roughly 12% of tests coming back positive, they said. Scaling out to the entire state’s population, they estimated that 4.7 million Californians had been infected — 12% of the state’s total population of roughly 39.5 million people. They used that and the known number of California deaths at the time to get a fatality rate of 0.03%.  Dr. Dan Erickson, one of the physicians, said the data showed ""millions of cases, small amount of death,"" adding that the fatality rate was close to that for the flu, which hovers under 0.1%. The doctors found a receptive audience in Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson.  Ingraham interviewed them on her show, and Carlson hyped their findings before claiming, in a statement experts said was misguided, that the coronavirus ""just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought."" Tesla CEO Elon Musk also shared the briefing on Twitter. The doctors did not respond to requests for comment sent through their website. The doctors’ press conference made waves on social media. But soon after it aired, the calculations supporting their push to end shutdowns were roundly disputed. YouTube removed the video from its platform, citing a community guidelines violation. The American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine ""emphatically condemn(ed)"" the doctors’ opinions in a statement. ""The data cited by Drs. Erickson and Massihi is extrapolated from a small population to the state of California, resulting in misleading conclusions regarding the mortality of COVID-19. Their data is flawed and represents selection bias,"" the statement said. The University of Washington’s Carl T. Bergstrom wrote on Twitter that the doctors’ calculations amounted to ""sampling bias"" because patients seeking tests likely think they’re sick.  The doctors’ calculations are like ""estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court,"" he said. ""Those are most likely people who had been symptomatic or had a reason to be tested,"" said Thomas Novotny, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at San Diego State University’s School of Public Health. ""That’s not representative of the state of California."" Testing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have encouraged health care providers to prioritize patients with symptoms, Novotny noted. The doctors’ comparison of the 0.03% rate they calculated with the flu’s mortality rate was also misleading, Novotny said. The first is ""a temporal estimate for what’s going on with COVID,"" he said, while the second is ""reported every year retrospectively.""  ""That’s something that’s not comparable,"" he said. Some of the first widely reported figures have been case fatality rates, which are calculated as the number of known deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. But case fatality rates don’t reflect the true count of infections, experts say. Tests for antibodies in the blood of people exposed to the coronavirus have offered early glimpses at the fatality rates for all infected individuals in certain geographic areas, although concerns about false positive results have led some experts to question the findings. One thing we can say for sure? The Bakersfield doctors didn’t ""discover that coronavirus mortality rate is 0.03%,"" as the Facebook post claimed. They made an estimate, and experts said that estimate was flawed. A Facebook post said: ""So 2 doctors from Bakersfield discover that coronavirus mortality rate is 0.03%. 13x less deadly than what was previously thought! Their analysis has since been banned from YouTube."" The Bakersfield doctors used testing data to argue that the death rate for COVID-19 infections is 0.03%. Their conclusions were disputed by experts and leading medical associations. The video was removed by YouTube, according to reports.

No, churchgoers don’t have to register with the government
","A group fighting COVID-19 stay-at-home orders that restrict religious gatherings made a reference to Nazi Germany in a post that carried this ominous headline: ""Churchgoers Must Register With the Government in Kansas City."" The post was published by Liberty Counsel, a national conservative Christian organization based in Orlando, Fla. It was signed by the group's founder, Mat Staver, who is a pastor and attorney, and included several fundraising appeals. The blog post, widely shared on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The group changed its headline after we published this fact-check. Kansas City’s mayor did issue an order that would have required churches to keep attendance lists at their gatherings, to be used by health officials in the event that a coronavirus outbreak was tied to a particular gathering. Such information could help with contact tracing, a process by which public health workers try to learn as they can about who a patient has been in contact with so those people can be notified about their potential exposure. But before that order took effect, the mayor issued a new order making the lists voluntary, not mandatory.  Churchgoers were never required to register with the city. In its May 1 post, Liberty Counsel claimed Kansas City officials are ""requiring every church to submit a list of members and attendees along with their names, addresses and telephone numbers to city officials for tracking and surveillance purposes."" The last five words appear in italics. ""The Germans did this very thing to Jews — collecting the names and locations of all known synagogue attendees -- in the early days of the Nazi regime,"" the post claimed. (It’s worth noting that the group sued Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in April after attendees at an Easter Sunday service inside a Louisville-area church were issued quarantine notices by Kentucky State Police.)  Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas issued a stay-at-home order on March 12 and has amended it five times as the coronavirus outbreak has played out.  When PolitiFact asked Liberty Counsel for information to back up its claim, the group cited Lucas’ fourth and fifth amended orders.  On April 30, the Fourth Amended Order said that effective May 6, non-essential businesses, including churches, could reopen to the public. They had to limit their premises to no more than 10 customers or guests at a time, or 10% of the building occupancy, whichever is larger; and they had to keep records of anyone who stayed on the premises for more than 10 minutes. The order singled out religious gatherings, including weddings, funerals, memorial services and wakes. The order said the so-called ""10/10/10"" provisions apply, although up to 50 people could gather for outdoor events, as long as organizers for any events ""maintain a record of attendees."" The mayor’s office reiterated in a news release at the time that religious gatherings could resume as long as event organizers record the names and contact information of all attendees. The city’s rationale for recording names was that health officials or event organizers could contact people in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak traced to a particular gathering. The requirement for keeping attendance lists never took effect, however. On May 4, three days after the Liberty Counsel post, Lucas amended the order again to make keeping lists of customers or guests recommended, but not required, for non-essential businesses. The Fifth Amended Order again singled out religious gatherings:  ""In the interest of public health and to avoid a COVID-19 outbreak in the community, event organizers should consider maintaining a record of attendees where appropriate. Attendees are not required, however, to provide their names or contact information at any religious gathering."" Lucas was criticized for making the change without any news release or other announcement. In a frequently asked questions document on the order, the city said the purpose of the recommendation was ""to more quickly trace, test and isolate individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 if an employee or customer had the virus at the time they frequented the business."" It also stated that all data would ""remain confidential and will be used only to address public health concerns and contact individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19."" An article shared on Facebook claimed that under a Kansas City mayor’s COVID-19 order, Kansas City ""churchgoers must register with the government."" As part of an order governing the gradual reopening of the city, the mayor initially ordered churches to keep lists of people attending church gatherings so that attendees could be contacted if a coronavirus outbreak traced to a particular gathering occurred. Four days later, that order was changed to make attendance list keeping recommended, but not mandatory.  However, no order ever required churchgoers to register with the government. In the event of a COVID-19 outbreak, however, it’s possible that names on attendance lists kept by churches would be turned over to the city. The claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of  Mostly False. UPDATE, May 11, 2020: This story has been updated to reflect that Liberty Counsel updated its blog post with a new headline following publication of this fact-check. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BDA2C0>],/factchecks/2020/may/07/liberty-counsel/no-churchgoers-dont-have-register-government/
