About 1% of gun sellers responsible for more than half of guns used in crimes, Hillary Clinton says
","When Hillary Clinton brought her presidential campaign to Milwaukee’s Tabernacle Community Baptist Church on March 29, 2016, she participated in a forum on gun violence with U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, and others. The Democratic front runner spoke softly as she recounted a number of fatal firearms encounters, in Milwaukee and across the country. Then she raised her voice as she presented some of her gun control policy proposals. And she made a claim that we want to check about guns used in crimes. ""The availability of guns has gone way too far. And the fact that gun-makers and -sellers are immune from liability …. Gwen will talk about what we need to do to stop some of these gun sellers,"" Clinton said. ""About, what, 1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes. So, we've got our work cut out for us. But let's not grow weary doing good, because in due time we will harvest if we stay focused."" We found there is some truth in Clinton’s 1 percent claim, but several significant caveats. Old data Experts told us the latest federal report that gets at Clinton’s claim, from 2000, is from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Relying on gun tracing data, the report found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998. So, Clinton’s claim might generally appear correct in terms of the figures. But there are a few things to tease out. 1. Clinton made her claim in the present tense and is relying on the latest, best data available -- but that data is 18 years old. The experts told us that ever since federal law was changed in 2003, tracing data has essentially dried up. That was when Congress approved the so-called Tiahrt Amendment, named for its original sponsor, U.S. Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan. It forbids the ATF from sharing information about guns it has traced with state and local police agencies except in the course of a criminal investigation. The change ""greatly restricted"" the release of crime gun trace data by the ATF, restricted access by researchers and plaintiff trial attorneys, and restricted what reports the ATF could issue themselves, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. 2. Clinton’s claim was about ""guns used in crimes,"" while the 2000 report referred to ""crime guns."" There’s a slight difference. Harvard University professor of health policy David Hemenway, who does research on firearms, told us that most any gun seized by police is considered a crime gun. That would include, of course, seized guns that were used in crimes, but also guns found by police that couldn’t be traced to particular crimes. 3. In referring to the 1 percent of gun dealers, Clinton said they were ""responsible"" for more than half of the guns used in crimes. But that doesn’t mean a gun used in a crime came directly from the dealer. Hemenway said that authorities trace crime guns to their original seller, but can’t necessarily determine whether other transactions of the gun were made prior to it being used in a crime. In other words, it’s possible to trace a crime gun to the store that originally sold it, but that gun might have changed hands any number of times -- legally or illegally -- before it was used in a crime. On the other hand, said Webster, gun dealers ""are one of the most important, if not the most important, conduit for guns into the underground market."" So, there is rationale for targeting gun sellers linked to crime guns to prevent, for example, purchases by a straw buyer -- a person who legally purchases a gun in order to turns it over to someone who cannot legally purchase one. (Tracing helped establish that a suburban Milwaukee gun store was a top seller of crime guns locally for more than a decade.) Our rating Clinton said about ""1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes."" The best data essentially backs up the claim, but it is from 1998. It’s also worth noting that the traces go back to the original seller of a crime gun and don’t take into account whether there were other transactions before a particular gun was used in a crime. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information -- our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB6A8C0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/15/hillary-clinton/about-1-gun-sellers-responsible-more-half-guns-use/

7 times, the delegate leader wasn't the one who got GOP nomination for president, John Kasich says
","Seeking an endorsement to boost his presidential campaign, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich met with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel a week before Wisconsin’s primary. (He won the endorsement, but won no delegates in the April 5, 2016 primary.) A few minutes into the March 29, 2016 interview, Kasich was asked how he can win the GOP nomination given that he so badly trails Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in delegates. Kasich replied by predicting that none of the remaining Republican hopefuls will have amassed the necessary 1,237 delegates in order to claim the nomination ahead of the party’s July 2016 convention in Cleveland. Then he made a claim that, if true, could make his plan -- to get delegates at the convention to throw their support to him -- appear more plausible. Republicans have had 10 conventions in which no candidate had won a majority of delegates, Kasich said, and ""only three out of 10 times was the front runner selected. Did you know? You didn’t know that. I know you don’t know that."" ""So, seven times, somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party."" So, the claim we’re checking is that 10 times, no Republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the party’s convention, and seven of those times someone who was not the leader in delegates was chosen at the convention as the nominee. Kasich is essentially correct on the numbers. But his statement is somewhat misleading in that the scenario he describes hasn’t occurred in  more than 60 years, and the nominating process has changed considerably since then. Kasich’s evidence To back Kasich’s claim, his campaign cited a March 2016 article in The Federalist about ""brokered"" Republican conventions. Sometimes the term ""contested"" or ""open"" is also used. Despite Trump’s considerable lead, it’s an open question whether he will reach the threshold of 1,237 delegates prior to the gathering in Cleveland. As Kasich indicated, the article said seven out of the 10 Republican conventions in which no candidate had a majority of delegates, the person who won the nomination was not the delegate leader. The most recent brokered Republican convention was in 1952. Ohio Sen. Robert Taft entered the convention as the delegate leader, with 35 percent of the delegates, followed by General Dwight D. Eisenhower,with 26.3 percent. The article says the delegates gave the nomination to Eisenhower, who in turn won the presidential election, because he was deemed more electable. A March 2016 article in The Week about brokered conventions also cited the seven of 10 figures. Political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us that Kasich’s seven-of-10 claim is on target. But there is an important caveat, according to Burden, who said: ""Before the 1970s, candidates often did not run in many primaries and caucuses to win delegates. And contested conventions were quite common. In the ‘modern’ nominating era, contested conventions are uncommon, with 1976 (Gerald Ford defeated Ronald Reagan) being the only close case. Before reforms pushed states to use open processes for selecting delegates, entering the convention with more delegates than an opponent was less meaningful than it is in the contemporary era."" Other experts agreed. David Karol, government and politics professor at the University of Maryland, emphasized that the phenomenon Kasich cites ""is in the distant past, when the process and our political culture were quite different."" Karol, who co-authored one book and co-edited another about presidential nominations, added: ""Most delegates were chosen by state party organizations and there was far less public input than there is today. But our political culture was quite different then and it wasn't considered an outrageous coup when the convention (chose someone other than the delegate leader). There wasn't a strong expectation that the nominee would run in and dominate the primaries."" (A final note: Some experts say the count could be six of nine times in which a contested GOP convention resulted in the nomination of a candidate who wasn’t the delegate leader. But Northeastern University political science professor Willam Mayer, who has written books on presidential nominations, told us that Kasich’s definition of a contested convention is defensible.) Our rating Kasich said that 10 times, no Republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the party’s convention, and seven of those times ""somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party."" He’s correct on the numbers. But his implication that history is on his side is misleading in that it’s been more than 60 years since the GOP chose a nominee who wasn’t the delegate leader going into the convention; moreover, the process of choosing a nominee has changed considerably in the intervening years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA9A040>],/factchecks/2016/apr/15/john-kasich/7-times-delegate-leader-wasnt-one-who-got-gop-nomi/

Hillary Clinton says Democratic debate moderators have not asked any questions about abortion
","Hillary Clinton said abortion has been ignored during the Democratic debates. Clinton got on the topic during the April 14 debate in Brooklyn, N.Y., when she said she would only appoint a Supreme Court justice who believed that Roe vs. Wade is settled law. ""And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake. We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth,"" Clinton said. ""We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question."" The line got a big applause from the audience. But was it correct? Abortion and debates We found no questions directly about abortion in nine debate transcripts, although at times the candidates brought up the topic themselves. We searched for the words ""abortion,"" ""Planned Parenthood"" and ""pro-choice"" in debate transcripts in Washington Post transcripts: Oct. 13, Las Vegas: Clinton said the Republicans ""don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood."" Nov. 14, Des Moines: Speaking about the Democratic candidates, Clinton said ""all of us support funding Planned Parenthood."" Dec. 19, New Hampshire: Clinton mentioned that a police officer was killed responding to ""Planned Parenthood murders"" and said that Republicans would defund Planned Parenthood. Jan. 17, South Carolina: No mentions. Feb. 4, New Hampshire: No mentions. Feb. 11, Milwaukee: No abortion questions were asked. Sanders said he had a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record, and Clinton touted her endorsement by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. March 6, Flint: No mentions. March 9, Miami:  The candidates were not asked their views on abortion, but a moderator mentioned that the Supreme Court was considering ""the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation."" But the question was about what qualifications Clinton would look for in a Supreme Court justice. April 14, New York: In the ninth debate, Clinton said governors are trying to restrict women's rights and that Donald Trump said women should be punished for abortion. "" And we are never asked about this,"" she said. ""And to be complete in my concern, Sen. Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I don't think it's a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks."" Sanders replied:  ""You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose..."" He called for expanding funding for Planned Parenthood. Several news articles including by the Washington Post, MSNBC, TIME, Vox stated that during the Democratic debates moderators haven’t asked about abortion. A spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice America, James Owens, told PolitiFact, ""It is correct that there has not been a single question about abortion in any of the Democratic debates."" NARAL has advocated for Democratic moderators to ask about abortion, including a campaign on Twitter #AskAboutAbortion. Before the New York debate, NARAL sent a letter to CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer urging him to ask about abortion. Renee Bracey Sherman, a board member at NARAL, wrote a column for Glamour posted the day of the New York debate that argued that even though they both support abortion, there are questions that should be asked about their positions: ""Will abortion be covered in Sanders’ Medicare-For-All plan? How will Clinton direct the Department of Justice to respond to the record number of attacks on providers? Will their administration step in to stop the prosecution of those who are self inducing their abortions? How will the candidates stop states from closing abortion clinics? Will their immigration policy ensure undocumented people are able to access abortion care? How will they ensure everyone is able to access safe, affordable abortion care in their community?"" There was a town hall, however, where the moderator brought up abortion, a spokesman for Clinton told us. In a Fox News town hall March 7, moderator Brett Baier asked Sanders and Clinton questions about abortion. Baier asked Sanders: ""Can you name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be OK with abortion being illegal?"" Sanders replied: ""I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to do with her own body."" He then posed a similar question to Clinton: ""Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it's born?  Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?"" Clinton replied that she supports abortion rights. ""I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother,"" she said. Our ruling Clinton says in nine Democratic debates ""We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question."" We could not find any example of a moderator asking a direct question about abortion, however Clinton and Sanders both raised the topic in multiple debates.

"['National', 'Social Security', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Clinton exaggerates Republicans' plans to 'privatize' Social Security
","During the Brooklyn presidential debate, Hillary Clinton positioned herself as a defender of Social Security while also blasting Wall Street. The Republicans, Clinton said, ""still want to privatize (Social Security). In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street."" However, this is exaggerated. It falls into a long tradition of politicians, including many Democrats, raising alarms over Republican plans for Social Security. As we noted more than two years ago, Republicans have long pushed -- unsuccessfully -- for adding an element of private investment to Social Security. Proponents usually call these ""personal accounts,"" while critics call it ""privatization."" Whatever term you use, none of the remaining three GOP presidential candidates has said the United States should ""turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street."" A primer on privatization Social Security benefits for today’s recipients come from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. But over the years, some conservatives have pushed for turning Social Security into a system where workers invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investments are higher than those for Social Security. The downside is the possibility of market losses. Even though Social Security funds would likely be invested more conservatively than many private investments, doing so would still carry risk that beneficiaries could lose value or, in a worst-case scenario, see their savings wiped out entirely. Neither outcome is possible under the current Social Security program. The most high-profile proposal along these lines came in 2005, when President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into ""personal retirement accounts."" Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam, and it died without even being introduced as legislation. A few years after that, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- who would in 2012 become the running mate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and now serves as House speaker -- offered a similar proposal, allowing workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. This idea also went nowhere in Congress. These two failures reinforced the longstanding conventional wisdom that changing the way Social Security operates is the ""third rail"" of politics (that is, touch it and you die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who are both reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates. For this reason, Social Security-themed attack ads have been prevalent over the years, often aired by Democrats, though sometimes by Republicans. Attacks against plans such as Bush’s and Ryan’s have often played up the term ""privatization"" as a scary concept -- so much so that supporters of this type of proposal have taken pains to distance their plans from that terminology. What the Republican candidates say When we contacted the Clinton campaign, they sent three examples, one for each of the remaining GOP hopefuls. For Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the Clinton campaign pointed to a remark by Cruz in the fourth Republican primary debate on Nov. 11, 2015. Cruz said, ""What I’ve said is for seniors, we should make no changes whatsoever. For younger workers, we should gradually raise the retirement age. We should have benefits grow more slowly, and we should allow them to keep a portion of their taxes in a personal account that they control, and can pass on to their kids."" This makes pretty clear that Cruz is offering an idea much like Bush’s 2005 proposal. It involves a portion of taxes, and it doesn’t simply hand over money to Wall Street but rather has individuals make their own decisions about how to invest it. A rundown of Cruz statements related to Social Security collected by AARP, an advocacy group for senior citizens, produces several other statements by Cruz that echo this general approach. This is notably different than what’s communicated by Clinton’s charge -- that Cruz would ""turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street."" For Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the Clinton campaign pointed us to a statement in the Chicago Tribune -- from 16 years ago. The article said that Kasich, then a U.S. House member, ""has introduced a plan similar to"" the one for Social Security that Bush, then a candidate, was advocating. It involved Americans putting ""perhaps 2 percentage points of their Social Security payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts for investment in stocks and bonds,"" according to the article. But that wasn’t in line with what Clinton charged in the debate, and today, Kasich doesn’t even cite personal accounts as part of his proposal for addressing Social Security. According to his campaign’s website, ""John Kasich’s balanced budget framework does not include changes to Social Security or its benefits to achieve balance, nor does it include the costs of filling Social Security’s deficits. As president he will lead a bipartisan effort to assemble the best ideas from the various reform plans that have been proposed to preserve its solvency."" The Clinton campaign also reached back 16 years to find evidence on the other GOP candidate, Donald Trump. It pointed to his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, in which Trump proposed allowing ""every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds. Federal guidelines could make sure that your money is diversified, that it is invested in sound mutual funds or bond funds, and not in emu ranches."" Here, too, Trump’s plan from 2000 was more nuanced than Clinton’s comment would indicate -- and more to the point, Trump appears to have said nothing about returning to the personal account idea. He does not mention Social Security among the policy issues he addresses on his website, and the AARP’s collection of Trump quotes on Social Security doesn’t provide any indication that he favors privatization now. Finally, it’s worth noting that the partial privatization plans have typically been limited to younger workers -- not those who have reached or are approaching retirement age. Our ruling Clinton said Republicans ""still want to privatize (Social Security). In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street."" At least one candidate, Cruz, has proposed a form of privatization involving personal accounts funded by a fraction of payroll taxes. Still, Clinton’s statement takes a longstanding Democratic exaggeration about the scope of GOP overhaul proposals and makes it even further off-base by implying that payroll tax revenues would flow directly to Wall Street without any input from beneficiaries. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7dbd6b4c-d8e0-4bd4-a973-8141d397f405",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC737F40>],/factchecks/2016/apr/15/hillary-clinton/clinton-exaggerates-republicans-plan-privatize-soc/

Does Hillary Clinton want a $15 or $12 minimum wage?
","Does Hillary Clinton think the federal minimum wage should be $12 an hour or $15? This question produced one of the more heated back-and-forths in an April 14 Democratic presidential debate between Clinton and opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders — starting when Clinton asserted that she has continuously supported the Fight for $15 advocacy campaign. ""I have supported the Fight for $15,"" Clinton said. ""I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the Fight for $15."" To Sanders, that was news. ""I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour,"" Sanders said. ""When this campaign began, I said that we’ve got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12."" An extended back-and-forth followed. We’re putting Sanders’ claim on the Truth-O-Meter. He’s right that Clinton’s official position is to raise the national minimum wage to $12 as a floor. However, she has also shown support for the Fight for $15 campaign that pushes for higher minimums in individual states and cities. Here’s what Clinton’s website says on that point: ""Hillary believes we are long overdue in raising the minimum wage. She has supported raising the federal minimum wage to $12, and believes that we should go further than the federal minimum through state and local efforts, and workers organizing and bargaining for higher wages, such as the Fight for $15 and recent efforts in Los Angeles and New York to raise their minimum wage to $15."" In June 2015, early on in her campaign, Clinton spoke with a gathering of Fight for $15 members via phone and told them she supported their campaign. ""All of you should not have to march in the streets to get a living wage, but thank you for marching in the streets to get that living wage,"" she said, according to the Washington Post. A few days later, Clinton delivered a campaign kickoff speech in which she called for raising the minimum wage, but she did not specify a number. Her support for the $12 minimum wage proposal seems to have emerged around July 2015, when she praised legislation proposed by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., arguing that it would be more politically feasible.   ""Let’s not just do it for the sake of having a higher number out there,"" she said, according to the New York Times. ""But let’s get behind a proposal that actually has a chance of succeeding."" By November, Clinton had started to say plainly that she prefers a $12 federal minimum wage. In the same month, though, she tweeted with the hashtag #FightFor15. What about Sanders? He’s right that he has advocated specifically for a $15 minimum wage since his campaign began. ""Let us be honest and acknowledge that millions of Americans are now working for totally inadequate wages,""  he said as part of his May 2015 announcement. ""The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage, which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years."" A couple months earlier, in March 2015, he put forward an amendment to eventually raise the minimum wage to $15. He also put forth legislation in July 2015.   Our ruling Sanders said, ""When this campaign began, I said that we’ve got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12."" Since the start of his campaign, Sanders has advocated for a $15 minimum wage. Since early on in her campaign, Clinton has supported the Fight for $15’s efforts in individual cities and states. But her official position is that she prefers a $12 federal minimum wage as a floor, allowing cities and states to go further. Sanders’ has a point that he is calling for a federal minimum wage that would be $3 more an hour than what Clinton says she favors. However, he misses the nuance that Clinton is also supportive of local efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15.

Hillary Clinton: Bernie Sanders 'has been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA'
","Reeling from attacks over her ties to Wall Street, Hillary Clinton blasted Bernie Sanders over his own connections to a target of liberal ire: the gun lobby. ""He’s been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA. He kept his word to the NRA. He voted against the Brady Bill five times,"" Clinton said during the April 14 Democratic primary debate in New York. She’s right about his votes against background checks and waiting periods, which took place from 1991 to 1993. But what about her attack that Sanders has consistently supported the gun lobby? That’s a lot less accurate. Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to bills on guns and has actually received low marks from the National Rifle Association over his decades-long legislative career. Sanders’ gun votes In addition to Sanders’ Brady Bill votes, the Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders’ votes against funding for gun research, twice for prohibiting lawsuits against firearms manufacturers (""what the head of the NRA called the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in the last 20 years,"" said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin), for increasing the burden of proof to prosecute law-breaking gun dealers, and for allowing firearms on Amtrak trains and in national parks. Schwerin also noted that Sanders voted for an amendment in the Brady Bill that allows prospective gun owners to buy a firearm if their background checks are not completed in three days. This is the amendment that facilitated Dylann Roof to purchase his .45 caliber Glock pistol, which he used to kill nine people in a historically black church in Charleston in 2015. But on the flip side, Sanders also voted against the NRA’s wishes and in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown elementary school massacre. We pulled together his votes on key gun bills over his 25 years in Congress (votes in bold reflect a pro-gun position): Year Legislation Sanders’ Vote Result 1993  Imposes a five-day waiting period and background checks on firearm purchases, part of the Brady Bill Nay Passed 1993 Imposes instant background checks instead for firearm purchases, part of amendment to Brady Bill Yea Passed 1993 Imposes an interim five-day waiting period while while waiting to put a instant background check system in place, part of Brady Bill conference report Nay Passed 1994 Bans semiautomatic assault weapons  Yea Passed 1996 Increase funding for the Centers on Disease Control and Prevention by $2.6 million to research firearm-related injuries Nay Failed 1996 Repeals the semiautomatic weapon ban  Nay Passed 1998 Increases minimum sentencing for gun crimes Yea Passed 1999 Creates ""instant check registrants"" and narrowly defines ""gun shows,"" part of Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act Nay Failed 1999 Imposes three day waiting period for guns purchased at gun shows, part of amendment to gun show act Yea Failed 2002 Allows pilots and flight personnel to carry firearms in the cockpit Yea Passed 2003 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2005 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2006 Prohibits funds from being used to enforce trigger locks on guns Nay Passed 2006 Increases the burden of proof for the AFT to penalize law-breaking gun dealers, as part of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms reform bill Yea Passed 2007 Prohibits foreign aid funding restrictions on U.S. gun ownership, as an amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2008 Yea Passed 2008 Prevents the use of funds for anti-gun programs as an amendment to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Yea Passed 2009 Gives the District of Columbia seats in the House of Representatives and repeals district’s ban on semi-automatics Yea Passed 2009 Allows the use of firearms in National Parks Yea Passed 2009 Allows concealed and carry across state lines Nay Failed 2009 Allows firearms in checked baggage on Amtrak trains, as an amendment to congressional budget Yea Passed 2009 Prohibits higher insurance premiums for gun owners, as part of an amendment to the Affordable Care Act Yea Passed 2013 Prevents the U.S. from entering the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, as an amendment to congressional budget Nay Passed 2013 Allows concealed and carry across state lines in states where the practice is not prohibited Nay Failed 2013 Lists all people prohibited buying a firearm in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Yea Failed 2013 Bans high-capacity ammunition magazines carrying more than 10 rounds Yea Failed 2013 Bans assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines Yea Failed Neither a ‘gun-lobby lapdog’ nor an ‘anti-gunner’ The Clinton campaign also noted that the NRA helped elect Sanders to the House of Representatives in 1990. While it’s true that Sanders and the gun lobby were on the same side in that election, their alignment was temporary. The NRA backed Republican incumbent Peter Smith in his 1988 race against Sanders. But Smith didn’t stick to his guns and came out in favor of an assault weapons ban after he won. Feeling betrayed, the gun group spent $18,000 attacking the incumbent in 1990 and issued bumper stickers emblazoned with images of Smith as Pinocchio and ""Dump Pete Smith,"" Garrison Nelson, a professor of state politics at the University of Vermont previously told PolitiFact. Paul Blackman, a former NRA research associate, told us in 2015 that while Sanders wasn’t exactly pro-gun and the NRA wasn’t explicitly pro-Sanders, he seemed like the lesser of two evils. ""I don't remember whether we ever made a pro-Sanders statement, but we certainly made it clear that Vermonters should vote against Rep. Smith, and everyone understood that to mean we were supporting, directly or indirectly, the election of Sanders,"" he said. ""Our people were satisfied that he was less bad than -- not equally bad as -- Smith."" ""It was an awkward situation for Bernie. Sort of like the enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont AP bureau chief. ""The NRA did not campaign for him but Bernie did oppose the Brady Bill. ... I do believe that Bernie ‘owed’ the NRA when he first went to Congress."" Since 1990, however, Sanders and the NRA seemed to part ways. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross said Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since his first days in Congress, adding he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog."" Blackman, the former NRA researcher, said the group doesn’t consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner."" Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, noted that Sanders’ latest grade from the NRA was a D. In fact, Sanders has earned failing grades from the NRA for the past two decades. His highest mark was a C-, a barely passing grade that doesn’t amount to full-throated support. (The group has not graded Sanders in 2016.) Year Grade 1992 D 1994 F 1996 F 1998 F 2000 F 2002 F 2004 D+ 2006 C- 2012 D- Our ruling Clinton said Sanders ""has been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA."" This is a stretch. Sanders won his congressional bid about 25 years ago thanks at least in part to the NRA, and has voted against major pieces of gun control legislation. However, he has also cast votes for gun control and has received low marks from the NRA for the past 20 years.

Bernie Sanders says he's 'one of the poorer members of the United States Senate'
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders relishes his everyman persona, and during the Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn, he offered evidence that he’s out of place in the ""millionaires’ club"" that is the U.S. Senate. ""I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate,"" Sanders said. Is that correct? We looked at the most frequently cited rundown of congressional wealth -- an annual study by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. We found that Sanders’ net worth does rank him in the bottom one-fifth of the 100-member chamber. Here’s a list showing Sanders and the 18 other senators whose net worth ranked below him for the 2014 calendar year. A negative value means liabilities greater than assets.:   Senate net worth rank Senator Minimum net worth 82 Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. $160,000 83 Mike Lee, R-Utah $120,000 84 Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. $120,000 85 Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. $90,000 86 John Thune, R-S.D. $80,000 87 James Lankford, R-Okla. -$10,000 88 Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. -$50,000 89 Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. -$80,000 90 Cory Gardner, R-Colo. -$110,000 91 Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. -$140,000 92 Marco Rubio, R-Fla. -$160,000 93 Jack Reed, D-R.I. -$170,000 94 John Cornyn, R-Texas -$230,000 95 Mark Kirk, R-Ill. -$260,000 96 Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. -$350,000 97 Roger Wicker, R-Miss. -$450,000 98 Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii -$460,000 99 Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. -$590,000 100 Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. -$720,000 We should note some caveats. The Roll Call survey is based on congressional financial disclosure forms, which offer the public only broad ranges of income in various categories. To determine the measurement it used in its ranking -- minimum net worth -- Roll Call used the total minimum reported value of the lawmakers’ assets minus the total minimum reported value of their liabilities. So the real amount could well be higher. In addition, the law exempts various types of holdings from disclosure, including the value of a primary residence, the value of personal possessions that aren’t held for investment purposes, and the value of retirement accounts. (The Center for Responsive Politics has a summary of what must be included in these forms here.) These factors led Roll Call to caution in its survey that ""the disclosure forms are imperfect at best."" Indeed, the data is vague enough that the differences between the net worths of the senators who cluster around Sanders verge on being indistinguishable. In fact, 10 other senators beyond the list of 18 above had a minimum net worth of less than $400,000 -- Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.; and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. That said, Sanders is largely correct that he’s on the lower end of the chamber’s income scale: The median senator, by Roll Call’s calculation, was $1.1 million, or almost seven times Sanders’ net worth. Our ruling Sanders said, ""I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate."" It’s important to remember that the financial-disclosure forms produce values too vague to be 100 percent certain of where each senator ranks in net worth. And with a minimum net worth of $160,000, we wouldn’t say Sanders is poor. That said, a credible calculation using financial disclosure forms put Sanders as having the 19th lowest net worth in the Senate. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8f91756-1e20-48c6-9d55-44f4d3c615b1",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAF9CC0>],/factchecks/2016/apr/15/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-hes-one-poorer-members-united-/

At New York debate, Clinton says US has higher accountability standards for toy guns than real guns
","Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders voted for a law that gave higher standards to toy guns than real guns, opponent Hillary Clinton charged at the New York Democratic debate. A 2005 law put restrictions on people’s ability to sue the gun industry for crimes committed using their products. As Clinton often points out, she voted against this law, while Sanders voted for it. ""We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns,"" Clinton said April 14. The claim that this law gives higher standards to toy guns is something Clinton has said in recent weeks. It’s not a settled question. Here’s why. A liability gap? The law at issue is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused, meaning if a gun dealer legally sells a person a gun, and then the buyer uses the gun to commit a crime, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. The law arose after victims, cities and states started to bring lawsuits against gunmakers that pursued new legal paths, such as one that argued manufacturers Glock Inc. and China North Industries had oversaturated the market, producing so many guns that it was inevitable some would fall into criminal hands. Most judges dismissed these kinds of lawsuits, but a minority allowed them to proceed. There are several situations that are not protected from lawsuits under the law. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. Opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court because the liability immunity is so broad and ambiguous, while the exceptions are narrow. Supporters, though, say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. We’ve written before that Congress has passed laws giving some other industries varying levels of immunity. A couple experts told us Clinton’s statement is unsound because the law sought to impose equivalent, rather than fewer, standards for gun makers that are already established for manufacturers of other products. As it stands, the victim of a crime committed with a toy — say, if a person seriously injured another person by shooting them with bb gun pellets — generally cannot sue the toy manufacturer, just as they can’t sue Toyota or Budweiser if they’re struck by a drunk person driving a Prius. The 2005 law ""basically put gun manufacturers in the same position that other product manufacturers are in,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""They’re responsible for defectively manufactured and designed products but not for failing to prevent criminal misuse of their products."" Additionally, toy guns and real guns pose fundamentally different risks because real guns are much more likely to be used in a crime than a toy gun, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor who edited a book on suing the gun industry. So before the law, the gun industry was subject to a wider range of liability that just doesn’t apply to a toy. As such, it’s hard to imagine a realistic incident with a toy gun that would cause someone to bring a suit against the toy company, yet they would not be able to sue a gun manufacturer for an equivalent situation involving a real gun. A hypothetical situation might be if a city experienced an epidemic of deaths or injuries that resulted from a prevalence of realistic-looking toy guns; think of the recent story of Tamir Rice, a Cleveland child carrying a toy gun who a police officer shot and killed, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of civil procedure at the University of Connecticut School of Law. In that case, a city might want to bring a suit against the toy gun manufacturer or seller for creating a public nuisance. But under the 2005 law, a city cannot sue a gun company if there is an epidemic of people being injured or killed by their guns. Lahav added, though, that she thinks the idea someone would bring a suit like this against a toy company is highly unlikely. In theory, there might be a liability gap between toy guns and real guns, but that wouldn't necessarily play out in reality, she said. Toy and real gun manufacturers can be sued for product defects that cause injury when the product is used as intended. But if an injury is caused by a product defect coupled with a criminal misuse of the product, a toy gun manufacturer could be held liable, but a real gun manufacturer could not under the 2005 law, said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor and an expert in the Second Amendment. That limits the gun industry’s incentives to make their products as safe as possible. The fact that a party cannot even attempt to bring these kinds of lawsuits against real gun manufacturers sets them apart from other industries, including toys, said Mark Geistfeld, a law professor at New York University and an expert in products liability. Such lawsuits against the gun industry might be destined to fail, but the 2005 law doesn’t even allow for the arguments to be tested. ""You’ve granted an immunity to the gun industry that you haven’t granted to any other industry,"" Geistfeld said of Sanders, noting that this supports the gist of Clinton’s point: that Sanders holds guns to a lower standard. Lytton noted, though, that he would not presume to know whether Sanders or anyone else who voted for the law would grant similar immunity to the toy industry if the opportunity arose. ""It’s not fair to basically enter into hyperbole that somehow he treated firearms differently (so) he would come down harder on toy guns,"" Lytton said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns."" She’s parroting a line she has stated previously. Clinton points to a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively.   This is a complex legal question, on which reasonable minds can disagree, so we rate Clinton’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4319fa9b-87b6-473d-a29c-487b2e070a6c",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8E2900>],/factchecks/2016/apr/15/hillary-clinton/new-york-debate-clinton-says-us-has-higher-account/

Rubbish! Experts degrade claim that every bit of plastic ever created is still around
","Paper or plastic? It's not just a question being posed at the checkout counter anymore. Activists have been arguing for years that plastic bags harm the environment, but now there's also concern that  plastic products may be a detriment to the planet because they break down so slowly -- or not at all. That's the point made by actor Jeff Bridges in a March 28 Facebook video that he narrates on behalf of the Plastic Pollution Coalition. When last we checked, it had over 453,000 shares. A statement at the beginning caught our attention: ""Plastic is a substance the Earth cannot digest, and every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists,"" he says. ""Plastic never goes away."" Every bit still exists? Never goes away? We wondered how quickly that claim would degrade under scrutiny. Unlike some types of plastic, it fell apart pretty quickly. Yes, some types of plastic are very slow to decompose, and under some conditions plastics can persist for decades or centuries. Bridges has a point that these types are pollutants and major causes for concern. But all the researchers we talked to said plastics have gone away. Eric Grulke, associate dean for research in the college of engineering at the University of Kentucky, said a lot of plastic products are no longer around because they've been burned. Incinerators consume them, sometimes to generate electricity, he said. That's most often done in Europe and Japan, where about 12 percent of solid waste is plastic, said Anthony Andrady, a chemical and biomolecular engineer at North Carolina State University. Other plastic decomposes at varying rates, depending on the type of plastic and where it is. Polyethylene, ""which is your basic hefty bag material, breaks down really, really slowly, and in a landfill it might not break down at all because it's typically starved of oxygen and water. So a polyethylene bag made in 1960 might still be with us, particularly if it's in a landfill,"" said Eric Beckman, a chemical and petroleum engineer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""On the other hand, if  you're talking about polylactic acid, which is popular in disposable tableware these days, that's actually designed to degrade,"" he said. ""And if it's in a composting environment, it will go away in a matter of weeks to months."" ""If it's sitting out in the environment, within a year it would be dust,"" said Grulke. Sheets of polylactic acid that line rows of crops on a farm, allowing the plants to poke through but deterring the growth of weeds, are made to decompose in sunlight. The same ultraviolet light that damages our skin ""chops up organic molecules fairly efficient,"" said Beckman. Not a lot of microscopic bugs have a talent for breaking apart the strong bonds that make many plastics so durable. But they exist, said Rigoberto Advincula, chairman of the polymer chemistry division of the American Chemical Society. And not all decomposition is good. In the ocean, there's two types of degradation, said Beckman. ""The good type is when it's actually chemically falling apart. When you have water and sunlight, that helps things go faster. There's also mechanical degradation, where you have a bottle that slowly gets ground down by bumping into other things and becomes chips. That's bad because fish will eat that. You can find fish with bits of plastic in their stomach."" Andrady said it's not universally desirable to have plastics break down or be burned because it takes a lot of energy to make them, energy that could be saved if they were recycled. To throw away a styrofoam cup or plastic cutlery ""is a waste,"" he said. And someday, if we run out of the oil that serves as the raw material for making resilient plastics and there are landfills with high concentrations of plastic waste, ""I can imagine people mining the landfills to get that resource. That is not inconceivable at all."" Andrady said. We contacted Bridges' press spokeswoman, called the Plastic Pollution Coalition (their voicemail wasn't accepting messages) and emailed the group two different ways. None of our inquires produced a response. Our ruling Bridges' statement was absolute: ""Every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists."" The experts say that's rubbish. ""It's too all-encompassing,"" said Beckman. Although far too much plastic persists in the environment in places and in forms that are unwanted, too much has been burned or degraded to make the assertion accurate. Because his provocative claim leaves no room for subtlety, we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF15C80>],/factchecks/2016/apr/14/jeff-bridges/rubbish-experts-degrade-claim-every-bit-plastic-ev/

Donald Trump wrong about 1980 Ronald Reagan race against Jimmy Carter
","During a rally in Rome, N.Y., Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cast himself as the inheritor of the mantle of Ronald Reagan -- at least in the way Reagan came from behind to win the 1980 presidential election. ""I haven’t even started on Hillary, and my numbers are better right now than Ronald Reagan's numbers were with Jimmy Carter,"" Trump said, at about the 17:50 mark. ""Ronald Reagan had a 30 (percent) favorability and he was behind Jimmy Carter by so much everybody said, 'Oh, this is going to be a disaster.' "" Does Trump have a solid historical point? We looked at Trump’s numbers against Clinton rather than against her fellow Democrat Bernie Sanders because Sanders leads Trump by even larger margins than Clinton does. (Trump’s press staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Comparing Trump vs. Clinton to Reagan vs. Carter We’ll start off by noting that the 1980 general election was different than the 2016 race -- at least so far -- because the earlier race had three major candidates. Carter, the incumbent president, faced Reagan, the Republican nominee, as well as John Anderson, running as an independent. To focus as closely as we could on the Carter-Reagan race, we set aside Anderson’s vote share and looked instead at the shares taken by Carter and Reagan. Here’s a summary of polls, from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. We have included all polls we could find that were taken in March and April of 1980. Date Pollster Carter Reagan Anderson Carter-Reagan margin March 1980 Time/Yankelovich 39 32 20 Carter +7 March 1980 ABC/Harris 38 38 22 Tie March 1980 Gallup 44 36 20 Carter +8 April 1980 Washington Post 42 33 16 Carter +9 April 1980 Gallup 45 36 19 Carter +9 April 1980 ABC/Harris 33 42 19 Reagan +9 April 1980 ABC 38 35 19 Carter +3 April 1980 Roper 39 27 16 Carter +12 Average 40 35 17 Carter +5 So, Carter did lead in seven of the eight polls, by an average of five percentage points. What about the potential Trump-Clinton contest? Here are the polls released since March 1, 2016, that were publicly released by the time of Trump’s comment, according to realclearpolitics.com:   If you take the average of all these polls, Clinton leads Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent. That’s an 11-point advantage -- more than twice the size of Carter’s lead over Reagan in 1980 at the same point in the campaign. So Trump’s numbers are not, contrary to his assertion, ""better right now than Ronald Reagan's numbers were with Jimmy Carter."" They are worse. We should note that there was a period during the 1980 campaign when Carter actually was far ahead of Reagan in head-to-head polling, but it was brief and it was winding down -- if not gone entirely -- by this point in the campaign. After American hostages were taken in Iran in November 1979, Carter’s approval ratings initially spiked, in what historians sometimes call a ""rally round the flag"" effect. This can be seen in Gallup’s job approval ratings below:  By January 1980, Carter’s job approval rating in the Gallup poll had risen to 58 percent. But by late March, it was back down again, to 39 percent. And that decline -- combined with the emergence of Anderson’s independent bid -- made the Carter-Reagan head-to-head contest much closer. This trend can be seen in 1980 polling data from political scientists Christopher Wlezien and Robert S. Erikson:  Comparing Reagan and Trump on favorability ratings Trump is also off-base on favorability ratings. We didn’t find many questions on favorability in the Roper database, but one April 1980 poll from Cambridge Reports found Reagan at 39 percent favorable, 44 percent unfavorable. That’s five percentage points ""under water"" -- favorable minus unfavorable. By contrast, Trump’s poll averages for favorability in 2015 and 2016 have -- at their best -- been 17 points under water. Currently, they are at 64 percent unfavorable, 30 percent favorable, according to HuffPost Pollster. That’s 34 points under water, far worse than Reagan’s in the spring of 1980.  There are other indications that Reagan, despite being considered too conservative by many in 1980, was not as polarizing a figure then as Trump is today. In May 1980, Gallup asked respondents to place Reagan on a rating scale between +5 (very favorable) and -5 (very unfavorable). About 70 percent placed him on the positive (favorable) side of that scale, compared to just 27 percent who placed him on the negative (unfavorable) side of that scale. And a CBS News/New York Times poll in April 1980 asked, ""Are there any candidates -- Carter, Reagan or Anderson -- you would refuse to vote for under any circumstances?"" Only 13 percent said they would definitely shun Reagan. Trump’s recent ""never-vote-for"" percentages are much higher. In two polls, a full 54 percent of those polled said they would definitely not vote for Trump -- an Associated Press/GfK poll in February 2016 and a Quinnipiac poll in March 2016. ""Reagan never had the high unfavorables that Trump does now,"" said Reagan biographer Lou Cannon. Did people say Reagan’s candidacy would be ‘a disaster’? Not in the national media coverage we found on Nexis, at least. David Broder, the legendary political reporter with the Washington Post, wrote a piece on March 12, 1980, that was headlined, ""Despite Primary Triumphs, Carter Could Be Vulnerable."" On April 7, Newsweek concluded its article this way: ""The politics of discontent has already propelled Ronald Reagan nearly to the Republican nomination, enticed John Anderson to the brink of a third-line candidacy -- and now brought home the message that Jimmy Carter is once again in trouble."" And on May 8, 1980, the Post published an article headlined, ""Poll Shows Reagan Now Likely Winner."" We asked Craig Shirley, who has written several books on Reagan, what he thought of of Trump’s comparison. ""There are just too many personal and ideological and cultural differences between Trump and Reagan and their times to draw anything resembling a parallel,"" Shirley said. Our ruling Trump said, ""My numbers are better right now than Ronald Reagan's numbers were with Jimmy Carter. ... Ronald Reagan had a 30 (percent) favorability and he was behind Jimmy Carter by so much everybody said, 'Oh this is going to be a disaster.' "" We found that Trump’s deficit against Clinton during March and April 2016 was twice the size of Reagan’s deficit against Carter in March and April 1980. We also found that Trump’s favorable/unfavorable ratings are much worse than Reagan’s were during that same period. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF0A040>],/factchecks/2016/apr/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-1980-ronald-reagan-race-a/

Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer claims state’s immigration law 'mirrors' federal law
","Arizona knows a thing or two about controversial laws. As Mississippi and North Carolina deal with the fallout of passing anti-LGBTQ laws, losing out on a Bruce Springsteen show, for example, former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer reflected on a controversial Arizona immigration law in a March 28 Fox Business interview about President Barack Obama’s plan to admit 100,000 refugees by 2017. Brewer, who has endorsed Donald Trump for president, was asked about criticism that followed the former governor after she signed the 2010 Arizona measure into law. The interviewer singled out a provision in the law, that gave ""law enforcement the right to ask people to see their papers."" ""The Arizona law, Senate Bill 1070, simply, just mirrors federal law,"" Brewer said. ""What we need is the federal government to do their job, they need to secure our borders, it’s their job to protect the people."" SB 1070, signed into law by Brewer in April 2010, allows law enforcement officers to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. It sounded a bit of an odd response by Brewer, given that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down most of the law since then, which included provisions such as making working in the country illegally a crime. Does Arizona’s immigration law really mirror federal law? We did not hear back from Brewer’s press office. SB 1070 a shell of its former self The law on the books today is a shell of the legislation that passed in 2010. Federal courts struck down every provision of the law with the exception of Section 2(B). That section allows state and local law enforcement to ask for proof of citizenship if that person is detained on a non-immigration related offense and the officer has ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person is undocumented. Because that portion of the law was not tossed out by the courts, you can reasonably conclude that it does not conflict with federal immigration law, said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. ""It does not really ‘mirror’ federal law, which delegates enforcement power to federal immigration authorities, not state and local law enforcement,"" Johnson said. But it’s close. UC Davis law professor Gabriel ""Jack"" Chin noted that there is a federal statute that allows the exchange of immigration information between the federal government and state and local police.  And a 2005 Supreme Court ruling in Muehler vs. Mena found that local police can ask someone lawfully stopped for their name, date of birth or immigration status. ""It is not inaccurate to say that the state policy of gathering immigration information is consistent with federal law,"" Chin said. ""As the Supreme Court held, it is certainly possible that SB 1070 could be interpreted in ways that violate federal law, but the basic step of gathering information does not."" What about the rest of the law Brewer signed? The problem with this narrow view of Brewer’s statement is that it ignores the host of other provisions passed by the Legislature that were deemed inconsistent with federal law. SB 1070 initially included several provisions. According to Northern Arizona University criminology professor Raymond Michalowski, the law originally: 1. Made it a crime of ""trespassing"" to be undocumented in Arizona; 2. Allowed citizens to sue a local entity if they feel immigration laws are not properly enforced; 3. Made it a crime to stop your car to pick up a day laborer; 4. Made it a crime to transport an undocumented immigrant; 5. Made it a crime to work without papers and allowed state police to arrest individuals without a warrant if they believed the person was in the country illegally.  All of these provisions, in the opinion of the courts, contradicted -- not mirrored -- federal law. ""Federal immigration and criminal law contains none of these provisions,"" Michalowski said. ""So the claim that SB 1070 ‘mirrors’ federal law is a fundamental misrepresentation of what that law sought to do."" Stephen Legomsky, an immigration expert and professor emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis, said Brewer ""clearly misspoke."" SB 1070 once made it a state crime, without probation, for people who failed to carry their papers. This is still a misdemeanor at the federal level, but probation is allowed. As far as making working without papers a crime, Legomsky said Congress made that an ""authorization for removal,"" not a criminal offense. And police arresting people without a warrant they suspect are undocumented is only permitted under federal law when the person is ""likely to escape"" before a warrant is issued. It is prohibited otherwise. Again, all these provisions were stripped, with the exception of police stops. ""The Supreme Court in its decision over SB 1070 indicated that it did not believe that the statute mirrored the federal law, and in fact, even if it did, it felt that it was improper for the state to engage in the activity that they wanted to do under that statute,"" said Evelyn Cruz, Arizona State University’s Immigration Clinic Director. Justice Anthony Kennedy’s majority opinion in the SB 1070 case makes this clear: ""Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,"" he wrote. Our ruling Brewer said, ""Senate Bill 1070, simply, just mirrors federal law."" The law on the books today comes close to mirrored federal law. But that’s only because the majority of the law was tossed out by the federal courts because it conflicted with federal law. It’s an odd thing for Brewer to be bragging about. Brewer’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4da56f6c-dc6b-4c5b-a867-f213f0ac5b84",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC81B80>],/factchecks/2016/apr/13/jan-brewer/former-arizona-gov-jan-brewer-claims-states-immigr/

N.C. Rep. Stam says state's controversial new law, HB2, isn't all that rare
","Rep. Paul ""Skip"" Stam, one of North Carolina’s most powerful Republican legislators, gave an interview Monday addressing the jobs and tourism dollars that North Carolina has lost in the wake of the new state law known as House Bill 2, or HB2. PayPal pulled a planned 400-job expansion in Charlotte, and Wake County tourism officials said the law had already cost the county $732,000 with another $24 million in question due to businesses and conventions expressing concern. Stam said the backlash against North Carolina is hard to understand because most states have similar laws. The next day, Deutsche Bank announced it was freezing plans to bring 250 jobs to Cary. ""If they’re not going to go here, there are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities that have the same type of policies that we just passed,"" Stam said, as The News & Observer quoted him on Monday. Is that right? Our first challenge was figuring out exactly what Stam meant when he said ""policies that we just passed,"" because HB2 covers a lot of ground. Here’s a brief rundown of what’s in the bill: Transgender people may not use the bathroom that matches their gender identity in schools or other public buildings – only the gender that’s on their birth certificates. Private businesses may set their own bathroom rules. Cities and counties may not enact local policies concerning discrimination or minimum wages that apply to private businesses. Whether they can enact stronger discrimination policies for their own employees is still unclear, as we explored in another fact check. The anti-discrimination policy for employment does not include sexual orientation or gender identity, which means businesses may discriminate against gay or transgender employees. The anti-discrimination policy for service in public accommodations also does not include protections for sexual orientation or gender identity. People fired for any discriminatory reason – including race, religion, disability and biological sex – no longer may file a lawsuit in state courts. People denied service for any discriminatory reason – including race, religion, disability and biological sex – no longer may sue in state courts. Stam can’t be totally correct when he says the law is the same as in 31 other states because some of these new policies are rare. Only North Carolina and Mississippi, for instance, do not allow discrimination claims to be filed in state court. And North Carolina is one of only a handful of states that have considered so-called bathroom bills to dictate that people can use only the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificates. And it’s that issue, in which North Carolina stands alone for now, that has received the most attention nationally. A similar proposal was shot down in South Dakota, but several other states are considering bathroom bills. Those include Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality, which tracks such bills nationwide. We double-checked all those state’s bills and found they’re still active; some states are considering multiple bills on the topic. But we digress. Even if Stam isn’t right on some parts of the bill, is he right on any of it? 31 states, 10,000 cities An aide told us Stam was referring only to the lack of discrimination protections for both sexual orientation and gender identity. The District of Columbia and another 20 states do offer such protections; therefore 30 states do not give discrimination protections for both categories. Stam said ""31 other states,"" and really it’s 29 others, but that difference is small. Part of the problem is that Stam was citing an outdated map from the pro-HB2 group Keep NC Safe. The map lists New York as only protecting sexual orientation, but the state added gender identity to its list of protections in January. As of now, two states protect sexual orientation but not gender identity (New Hampshire and Wisconsin), and 28 states protect neither category. Most of those are in the South and Midwest. Stam is right that about 10,000 cities also don't give discrimination protections to gay or lesbian people. An aide told us it was actually just a conservative guess Stam made. We counted and found the guess was on target – it’s safe to say the 30 states in question contain more than 10,000 incorporated places. Because of state-by-state discrepancies in defining places, we counted all incorporated places instead of just cities. Some states divide places into townships, towns, boroughs, villages or cities. Other states call everything a city, even if that city has only four residents — like Ruso, N.D. Some states – looking at you, Michigan – have wildly confusing systems of local governments with overlapping boundaries and differing powers that make it difficult to determine an accurate count. But while we couldn’t find an exact number, we were able to confirm more than 10,000 incorporated places in those states Stam referred to. North Carolina alone has 552. It's worth noting that more than 200 places or counties nationwide have passed anti-discrimination laws that are stricter than their state laws. Still, Stam’s ""10,000 cities"" estimate remains accurate. Our ruling Stam said there are dozens of states and thousands of cities that businesses should also avoid if they truly oppose North Carolina’s new law. That’s overly broad, since the law does many different things. In some cases, North Carolina is one of two states or the only state with policies that HB2 brought into law. But Stam clarified that he was talking specifically about discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. On that, his claim of ""31 other states and 10,000 other cities"" is basically true. Technically there are 29 other states, not 31. That doesn’t really detract from the point he was trying to make – but the fact that he glossed over other parts of the bill does. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC85380>],/factchecks/2016/apr/13/paul-skip-stam/nc-rep-stam-says-states-controversial-new-law-isnt/

Does Hillary Clinton support fracking?
","Looking to out-green Hillary Clinton in New York, Bernie Sanders charged that Clinton’s position on fracking was at odds with voters. New Yorkers ended the practice in the state in 2014, and Sanders called for a nationwide ban during an April 11 rally in Binghamton. Clinton, in contrast, remains on the side of the frackers, Sanders said on NBC’s Meet the Press, when he launched a multipart attack on Clinton’s positions on fracking, trade and campaign finance. ""Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water,"" he said April 10, ""and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country."" Was Sanders telling the fracking truth? (We examined Clinton’s support for free trade in a separate fact-check.) While Clinton’s past support of fracking is well documented, her current position leaves more wiggle room than Sanders’ statement suggests. Shale promoted 'round the world To refresh, fracking or hydraulic fracturing means producers are blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals into shale rock miles underground to extract natural gas. The Environmental Protection Agency considers shale gas to be clean energy. Some environmentalists, though, are doubtful that it’s that much better than coal or oil, given reports that fracking can cause methane leaks (a greenhouse gas that’s much more potent than carbon dioxide) and earthquakes and set water ablaze. Clinton clearly supported the practice as secretary of state. Her special envoy for international energy affairs launched the Global Shale Gas Initiative encouraging other countries to explore shale as an energy source. An in-depth investigation by progressive magazine Mother Jones said that Clinton’s support of fracking was ""part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel."" We found instances of Clinton and the State Department talking up fracking to Latin America, the European Union, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, China and India. ""The United States will promote the use of shale gas. Now, I know that in some places is controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources,"" Clinton said in a 2009 speech to the Inter-American Development Bank. After Clinton left the State Department in 2013, she continued to support fracking but repeatedly called for ""smart regulations"" in speeches and in her book, Hard Choices. Fracking with nuance in 2016 Compared with Sanders’ unequivocal opposition and the Republicans’ strong support, Clinton has a more complicated answer when it comes to fracking. Essentially, she supports it as long as there’s environmental oversight and no local opposition. Here’s how Clinton detailed her position during the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan: ""I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — No. 3 — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using. So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated."" (""My answer is a lot shorter,"" responded Sanders. ""No, I do not support fracking."") Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin referred us to Clinton’s plan ""to address the fracking-related risks people are concerned about."" ""This is particularly important given that the federal government doesn’t get to say where fracking occurs and where it doesn’t, but can put new safeguards in place,"" Schwerin said. Katie Brown of Energy in Depth, the research and education arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, told PolitiFact that Sanders’ position to ban all fracking is outside the mainstream. ""Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, joins Democrats across the county such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, and California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (just to name a few), who have all touted strong regulations by the states and supported fracking for its environmental and economic benefits,"" Brown said. Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, referred us to a Reuters article, in which supporters of fracking cast Clinton’s comments as campaign rhetoric and opponents urged her to cut the caveats and ban it outright. But what exactly would Clinton’s caveats mean for frackers? A portrait of regulated extraction Clinton’s three conditions would uphold existing bans and add new ones to the mix. But they wouldn’t amount to a universal ban. The first condition leaves local and state bans in place, such as those in Vermont, New York and a few dozen cities and counties across America. Her second condition would add dozens of sites that have methane emissions or water contamination. Natural gas is primarily methane, so we’ll assume Clinton is talking about ""fugitive emissions"" or leaks. Estimates for fugitive emissions, typically expressed as a percentage of the total production, vary widely. A round up of studies by watchdog blog Carbon Brief found estimates ranging from 0.6 to 9 percent (the threshold for being cleaner than coal is 3.2 percent). Various industry and independent research has indicated that a good chunk of leaks come from a small number of ""super-emitters"" (roughly one in 25 facilities, according to a 2015 Colorado State University study). Clinton could ostensibly shut down these methane spewers, which include, for example, about 50 production sites in northern Texas and four lift wells in the Gulf Coast. Water contamination is not systemic, according to a controversial 2015 EPA study, which nonetheless identified 151 cases of fracking fluid spills in 11 states from 2006 to 2012. Robert Howarth, a noted critic of fracking and biogeochemist at Cornell University, estimates at least 4 percent of production wells pollute water, but contends that the problem is widespread given the sheer number of wells. Under Clinton’s condition, fracking could be banned in, for example, at least 25 counties in Pennsylvania and at least 12 counties in Colorado, if not in all 11 states with noted cases of spills. Frackers are already meeting Clinton’s third condition, to an extent. At least 26 states have some rules on chemical disclosure on the books, though most allow frackers to protect ""trade secrets,"" according to the American Chemical Society. In addition, the Obama administration now requires drillers on federal and tribal lands to report the composition of their fracking fluid to FracFocus, an industry-backed registry of more than 100,000 wells across America. (Here’s an example.) Environmentalists contend that these rules are not nearly enough. Howarth told PolitiFact that chemical additives are ""a small part of the problem."" ""The frack return fluids are full of really nasty materials in addition to the additives, and the precise nature of this toxic brew is seldom known,"" he said. ""Clinton's focus on just the additives is misguided."" That being said, Clinton’s condition could ban fracking in Virginia and Missouri, two states with fracking activity but no disclosure rules in place at the time of this report. Here’s a map that shows how Clinton’s conditions could affect fracking in America:  Our ruling Sanders said that Clinton supported and continues ""to support fracking."" As secretary of state, Clinton supported and promoted fracking around the world. As a 2016 candidate, her support comes with conditions such as local choice, stronger environmental regulation and chemicals. Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC88A40>],/factchecks/2016/apr/13/bernie-sanders/does-hillary-clinton-support-fracking/

No evidence that cream of tartar and orange juice will help you quit smoking
","Quitting smoking is hard. Over the years, ex-smokers have sworn by a myriad of methods: pills, patches, cold turkey. The list goes on.  But one cheap and easy quit-smoking-fast tactic making the rounds on Facebook sounds too easy to be true.  And that’s because it is.  According to a viral Facebook post that’s been shared over 300,000 times since Oct. 14, simply mixing cream of tartar powder with orange juice will ""flush the nicotine out of your system."" The post features a picture of cream of tartar with a lengthy caption that says:  ""Go to your favorite grocery store and buy Cream of Tartar Seasoning and a gallon of Orange Juice. Mix 1 teaspoon in a glass and drink once a day. I recommend when you get up and another glass halfway through your day. I know this sounds too simple, but it really works! The Cream of Tartar flushes the nicotine out of your system and blocks it from receiving it again! After about two days, smoking tastes like s***, you're blocked from the nicotine rush and the desire is gone!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that drinking cream of tartar and orange juice rids the body of nicotine and thus helps people quit smoking.  We found a detailed example of the claim in a May 2018 article by Shareably, a lifestyle and entertainment website. But the article lacks credible sources, instead citing dubious health websites ""Natural Health and Healing 4U"" and ""Organic Health."" It also lists Providr.com as its primary source –– a clickbait mill that the fact-checking website Snopes exposed for fraudulent Facebook practices in 2018. The basis behind the claim is problematic because it relies on unsupported theories about detoxifying the body through various diets or cleanses. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, an office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, says that a variety of detoxification diets, regimens and therapies ""have been suggested as ways to remove toxins from your body, lose weight, or promote health.""  However, the center warns that some of these programs can be unsafe and falsely advertised, and said a 2015 review concluded ""there was no compelling research to support the use of ""detox"" diets for weight management or eliminating toxins from the body."" The Shareably article alleges that the way cream of tartar helps ""flush"" nicotine out of the body is by getting ""your adrenal glands working in conjunction with the rest of your body... Then your body naturally decides which toxins to eliminate through bowel movements, urine, and sweat.""  But it is unclear how that could even work. While potassium-rich cream of tartar has a diuretic effect, meaning it increases urine production, this doesn’t explain how it would somehow impact metabolism. ""I know of no biological mechanism by which cream of tartar would get the adrenal glands working,"" Neal Benowitz, professor emeritus at the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, told PolitiFact in an email.  ""The vast majority of nicotine is eliminated by liver metabolism, and only a small fraction excreted unchanged in the urine."" Benowitz said he knows no ""biologically plausible argument"" for why this drink mixture should work. A viral Facebook post says people can easily quit smoking by mixing cream of tartar and orange juice because it helps remove nicotine from the body.  This claim relies on unsubstantiated pseudoscience. No credible evidence supports it. We rate it Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF0A440>],/factchecks/2019/oct/30/facebook-posts/no-evidence-cream-tartar-orange-juice-drink-will-h/

She also didn’t say it in 1988, when she interviewed Fonda, who apologized for her participation in being photographed while seated in a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun in 1972, according to an ABC News transcript we found in the Nexis news archive.  ""Jane Fonda told me that she now realizes in her urgent desire to end the war, she unthinkingly caused pain to many Americans who fought in Vietnam,"" Walters said. ""In our interview tonight, she speaks directly to former prisoners of war, to Vietnam veterans and their families. And confronting her past, she then apologizes.""  Searching Nexis further, we couldn’t find evidence that Walters said or wrote the statement that appears in the Facebook post.

No evidence combo of Motrin, Robitussin causes heart attacks in children. Talk to your doctor
","Dubious medical advice is not only plentiful on social media – it’s persistent. Such is the case for a decade-old email chain that warns against giving children a combination of Motrin and Robitussin, because they may have a heart attack.  One example of the claim, which has been popping up in email inboxes since at least 2008, has gotten over 115,000 shares on Facebook and says that an 8-year-old girl named Madison passed away after she was allegedly given both medications: ""This was sent to us from a nurse in our district  … thought I’d pass along just as an FYI. Motrin and Robitussin don’t mix!!! Madison, age 8, passed away just a few days ago. We’ve been asked to pass this on. Doctors told her family that there have been quite a few children Madison’s age that have died recently the same way that she did. The only common link between them was that they were given Motrin (ibuprofen) and Robitussin together, this caused a heart attack. They believe this is what happened to them. They told her to alert everyone to this. ‘Do not give children both of these medicines together.’ You can give them one or the other but not both. When Madison collapsed she suffered a heart attack and they were able to revive her but the loss of oxygen damaged her brain and she was put on the respirator. After this she had four strokes before she died after being taken off the respirator. Please pass this on !!!!!!!!!"" The bottom of the post has the email signature: ""Lisa Lopez M.A. Children’s Medical Center of Dallas Pulmonary Clinic."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This rumor is just that –– a rumor. There is no evidence to suggest that a Motrin-Robitussin combination causes heart attacks in otherwise healthy children. The Children’s Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, that appeared in the email signature came out to dispel the rumor in 2010, roughly a year after it started being shared. The hospital’s announcement said the following: ""In 2009, a Children’s employee received the e-mail from a friend and inadvertently forwarded it from a work account. Because the employee’s professional signature was included at the bottom of the e-mail, the information appeared to come from a reliable source at Children’s Medical Center. This is not the case."" All medications have side effects, the hospital noted, and ""parents of children with underlying medical conditions must always be vigilant about the medications their child is taking."" The hospital statement advised parents to consult with their children’s doctor or a pharmacist before mixing any over-the-counter drugs. The Children’s Medical Center also addressed the rumor in a tweet on Dec. 22, 2014: ""Facebook post about Motrin & Robitussin is not correct & was not posted by one of our employees."" The tweet linked to a 2009 fact-check by Snopes on the topic. It’s important to note that the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend children under the age of two be given cough-cold medications. But the agency has not issued any warnings that the ingredients in Motrin (which contains ibuprofen) or Robitussin (which contains dextromethorphan and/or pseudoephedrine or sometimes chlorpheniramine) could cause heart attacks in children when combined. These ingredients are also in many other medications on the market, yet the chain email only singles out Motrin and Robitussin.  If the danger of heart attacks, strokes or death was prevalent in the combination of two commonly used medications, health officials would have issued widespread public health warnings. Motrin alone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and according to the FDA, the labels of over-the-counter versions warn that for adults and children ""(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. These can be fatal. The risk is higher if you use more than directed or for longer than directed."" Ashley Turney, an FDA spokesperson for over-the-counter drugs, told PolitiFact that ""use of Robitussin products, with or without Motrin, is not associated with heart attacks."" She described Robitussin as an umbrella brand containing a series of children’s cough and cold products that may contain a single ingredient or combinations of dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, phenylephrine hydrochloride, or chlorpheniramine maleate. ""The recommended use, dosing, and warnings vary amongst the seven Robitussin products that are intended for use in children over 4 or 6 years,"" she said.  Turney noted that it’s important for people to read the drug facts label directions for all over-the-counter medications.  An old rumor claims combining Motrin and Robitussin can cause heart attacks in children. There is no evidence that giving both of these medications to children causes heart attacks. Children who are too young or have underlying medical conditions can experience adverse side effects from taking any combination of over-the-counter medicine, health officials say. Parents are recommended to talk with their child’s health care provider, or a pharmacist, if they have any questions about mixing medications.

Claim that Tulsi Gabbard is in a picture with leader of Antifa, Occupy ICE is mostly wrong
","A Facebook post portrays Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard as a supporter of the anti-fascist movement, claiming that a photo shows her posing with someone who leads the movement. ""Antifa Fascist Fangirl Tulsi Gabbard posing with Evan Duke, leader of Portland Antifa and Occupy ICE,"" said an Oct. 22 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 100 times. (The post says ""antifa fascist"" — yet antifa is short for anti-fascist.) The picture used in the post does include a man named Evan Duke who appears to support the antifa movement. But Duke and an antifa group in Portland, Ore., told PolitiFact that Duke does not lead antifa nor Occupy ICE. The photo circulating on Facebook was taken in North Dakota when Gabbard went there to support veterans and others protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and its potential impact on water safety and tribal lands. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact requested comment from Gabbard’s congressional office and presidential campaign. Her congressional office referred us to her campaign, which did not respond to our queries. Antifa is a term used for a collection of far-left, anti-fascist groups across the country that rally against white supremacy and other causes, at times resorting to violence. The antifa movement goes back decades, but regained attention after antifa groups counterprotested white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.  Conservative group Turning Point USA in August 2019 asked Gabbard if she would be willing to denounce antifa. ""I have denounced antifa,"" Gabbard said. Occupy ICE is a movement that protests and wants the abolishment of the federal immigration agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. The movement gained traction in June 2018 with protests of the Trump administration’s ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. The Facebook photo features Gabbard and seven other people.  Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, posted a similar picture of the group on her Facebook page on Dec. 10, 2016. She described the people in the image as a group of veterans helping with safety and security operations at a camp protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.  ""I'm honored to have met these incredible veterans, who inspire as they continue their mission of service,"" Gabbard’s post said. ""They are in this for the long haul, planning to stay until the drilling pad and construction equipment are removed. #nodapl #mniwiconi #waterislife #veterans."" The photo in the Oct. 22 Facebook post also appears on a website called Hallwalls, on a page that promoted a January 2017 event by a group called VeteransRespond. The group planned to present a ""storytelling event featuring United States military veterans who stood at Standing Rock."" The page describes VeteransRespond as a national service organization formed by veterans who went to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. The Hallwalls caption for the photo identified one of the men as ""Evan Duke (Occupy Wall St.)"" Snopes.com found a Facebook account for someone named Evan K Duke III, who on Dec. 9, 2016, posted a picture similar to the one posted by Gabbard and to the one now circulating on Facebook.  Duke’s post said:  ""#NoDAPL #StrengthAndHonor Occupy/Veterans camp built an HQ and barracks for incoming vets at Standing Rock with donations from people across the United States. We processed and housed as many people as we could on the ground during the blizzards. We were invited to be Tulsi Gabbard's security detail during her stay at camp. Before she left she came to our little plywood and 2x4 HQ to tell us how proud of us she was. With tears in her eyes she told us we were on the right path to creating the change this nation needs. We shed tears with her and said our Alohas. We taught her the Lakota word Doksha (until we see you again). Farewell relative. You are one of us!"" PolitiFact reached out to that account, and the user confirmed he was in the picture being shared on Facebook. Duke’s account includes antifa-related posts, but he said he was not the leader of antifa nor of Occupy ICE. ""Whoever made such claims clearly has no understanding of how de-centralized movements work,"" Duke said. ""There are no leaders, there is no formal organization, their (sic) are no meetings, plans, rosters. Within those movements there are simply autonomous activists organizing as they see fit."" Duke’s Facebook account also posted a detailed message on Aug. 26, 2016, to actress Shailene Woodley’s Facebook page. Duke wrote that he was with ""Occupy Inauguration Planning Committee,"" a mass rally scheduled for Inauguration Day in January 2017 in D.C. He asked Woodley for her endorsement and participation. (Woodley had supported protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline.) PolitiFact reached out to a group called Rose City Antifa (whose website said it was founded in 2007 in Portland, Ore.) asking if Duke was the ""leader of Portland Antifa and Occupy ICE,"" as the Facebook post claimed. ""Evan Duke is not the leader of Portland Antifa, he is not a member of our organization, and he is not the leader of Occupy ICE,"" the group responded in an email. They said he had never been the leader of the groups, either. Our ruling A Facebook post claim to show, ""Antifa Fascist Fangirl Tulsi Gabbard posing with Evan Duke, leader of Portland Antifa and Occupy ICE.""

Fact-checking Joe Biden's claim that he was among the poorest in government
","In challenging President Donald Trump to release his tax returns, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said he had released 21 years of his returns and then claimed relative poverty for himself. ""I entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government — in Congress and as vice president,"" Biden said.  Biden, who turns 77 on Nov. 20, was born into a working-class family in Scranton, Pa. He entered Congress in 1973 after being elected to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate at the age of 29. He served there until becoming vice president under Barack Obama, a post he held until January 2017. To back up Biden’s first claim, that he ""entered as one of the poorest men in Congress,"" Biden’s campaign sent us a 1974 Delaware newspaper article. It has incomplete figures on Biden’s finances, and they compare him only to the two other members of the state’s congressional delegation at the time. We looked for outside data on this point and did not find much, but indications are Biden didn’t have much wealth.  Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, has done wealth rankings, but only for members of Congress and dating back only to 1990. The Center for Responsive Politics provided us a 1973 summary of financial disclosures made by only some members of the House and Senate; it was published by Congressional Quarterly.  ""Unfortunately, it’s hard to say anything concrete about his actual net worth in 1973, because all we have to go off of is this summary"" and not the actual disclosure documents, said Center for Responsive Politics researcher Alex Baumgart. ""There's no listed securities here for Biden like there are for other members. From that, it’s reasonable to infer he had no major investments listed on his financial disclosure."" The summary Biden reported outside income in 1973 of $6,050, all from speeches. On Biden’s second claim about leaving as one of the poorest officials in government, Biden’s campaign sent us rankings from 2005, 2006 and 2007. Those rankings don’t account for the fact that Biden remained in government for another decade. The rankings are from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which annually ranks the wealth of government officials including members of Congress and top officials in the executive and judicial branches. Biden ranked near the bottom in the center’s data in the years before he became vice president: Biden ranked 570th of 585 officials in 2005; 614th of 636 officials in 2006; and 626th of 639 officials in 2007.  Because officials report their assets and liabilities on official forms as ranges, the rankings use estimates. Biden’s estimated net worth was -$47,494 in 2005; -$12,492 in 2006; and -$52,493 in 2007. In other words, it appeared that his debts outpaced his cash and other assets. The center’s rankings only go back to 2004. (Biden’s campaign also sent us reports indicating that Biden’s net worth when he left office as vice president was far less than that of former vice president Al Gore and Dick Cheney, and less than current Vice President Mike Pence. Biden’s original statement did not compare himself to other vice presidents.) We looked for the latest rankings by the Center for Responsive Politics to get a sense of where his wealth ranked when he left the White House.  In the latest data that include Biden, Biden again ranked near the bottom: 577 of 581 officials in 2014.  His estimated net worth was -$947,987, based on official reports filed in 2015. Since leaving the White House, Biden has reaped millions.  CNBC reported in June 2019 that Biden and his wife, Jill, made more than $15 million combined in 2017 and 2018. And the same month, the Washington Post reported that Biden has made millions of dollars largely from book deals and speaking fees for as much as $200,000 per speech. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates Biden’s net worth, as of July 2019, at between $2.14 million and $7.92 million.  Biden said, ""I entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government, in Congress and as vice president."" Biden likely was among the less wealthy members when he first entered Congress, as a senator, in 1973.  The latest available rankings by the respected Center for Responsive Politics that include Biden, based on official reports filed in 2015, put Biden near the bottom of 581 members of the federal legislative, executive and judicial branches, in terms of wealth. We rate Biden’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA76F40>],/factchecks/2019/oct/30/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-bidens-claim-hes-among-poorest-g/

Vandergriff inaccurately describes bill that would have eased late-term abortion laws
","Republican GayDonna Vandergriff has turned to abortion in her effort to portray Democrat Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg as ""too extreme"" for the 72nd House District in wetern Henrico County. Vandergriff recently sent voters a mailer with a colored picture of a mother nuzzling a newborn, and a black and white shot of VanValkenburg in the background. ""Did her life have value 10 minutes before she was born?"" the capitalized print asks. ""Socialist Democrat Schuyler VanValkenburg says no."" The flip side says ""Schuyler VanValkenburg was the co-sponsor of the Democratic bill that would have allowed abortion until the moment of birth."" We fact checked this statement. Vandergriff’s mailer erroneously cites as its source a bill that made no mention of abortion. It would have required health insurers to cover pasteurized, donated human breast milk, which in rare instance is needed for infants. The measure never came up for a vote and died.  Matt Williams, spokesman for Vandergriff’s campaign, said the correct source is an unsuccessful bill that would have eased the state abortion restrictions. It was introduced in January 2019 by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax. VanValkenburg was among 21 Democratic co-sponsors. Debate focused on the bill’s provisions for rare third-trimester abortions, which are allowed if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy would ""likely"" kill a woman or ""substantially and irremediably"" harm her mental or physical health. The legislation would have lowered the threshold of certifying physicians to one. That doctor would have to attest that the pregnancy would damage a woman’s health. The ""substantial and irremediable"" test would have been repealed. Tran, under tough questioning by Republicans during a Jan. 28 hearing, acknowledged her legislation would allow an abortion when a mother is dilating. Many Republicans claim the bill shows Democrats support ""abortion to the time of birth."" The bill died on a partisan 5-3 vote in a House subcommittee VanValkenburg doesn’t sit on. Third trimester abortions are extremely rare; the state Department of Health has recorded two this century. But even with failure of Tran’s bill, they are legal in Virginia. The Supreme Court ruled in its 1973 Roe v Wade decision that states may prohibit an abortion after fetal viability if there are exceptions to protect the life or mental or physical health of the mother.  This undercuts Vandergriff’s claim that the bill would have ""allowed abortion until the moment of birth."" That possibility already existed. Virginia law allows third-trimester abortions if three doctors certify that ""the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the dealth of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman."" Tran’s bill would have eased those requirements. Vandergriff is not the only candidate misstating the bill. During the course of writing this fact-check, Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, began making similar charges against her opponent, Del. Debra Rodman. Rodman also co-sponsored Tran’s bill and next to Tran while she was testified in the January hearing. Dunnavant has sent a mailer saying Rodman ""proposed legalizing abortion in the ninth month."" Dunnavant is also running a TV ad saying, ""Debra Rodman’s bill would allow late-term abortions for any reason up to the moment of birth."" Our ruling  Vandergriff says VanValkenburg co-sponsored a bill that would have ""allowed abortion until the moment of birth.""  She’s referring to a bill, introduced in January 2019. Vandergriff’s claim is misleading because third-trimester abortions were already protected by federal law and allowed in Virginia in extremely rare conditions when three doctors certify that pregnancy will ""likely"" kill the mother, or ""substantially and irremediably"" impair her mental or physical health. The bill - which VanValkenburg did co-sponsor, would not have created an unconditioned right to a third-trimester abortion, as Vandergriff suggests. It would have loosened the requirements for getting one by allowing one doctor to certify the abortion is necessary to protect the mother’s life or health. We rate Vandergriff’s statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA2BF80>],/factchecks/2019/oct/30/gaydonna-vandergriff/vandergriff-inaccurately-describes-bill-would-have/
"['Crime', 'Illinois', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump ‘dead wrong’ about the change in murders in Chicago
","During his first visit to Chicago since taking office, President Donald Trump took aim at one of his favorite targets: the city’s violence. While criticizing Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson for boycotting his speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police Monday, Trump again repeated a Pants on Fire! claim about the city having the nation’s strictest gun laws, compared violence in Chicago to Afghanistan — as he has in the past with Baltimore — and contended reductions in crime here are failing to keep pace with those being made nationally. ""Over the last two years, the number of murders in America and America’s major cities has dropped, unlike here, by more than 10%,"" Trump said. ""And if we ever took the Chicago numbers out of our total numbers, the numbers would be incredible — and they already are, even including Chicago."" Nationally, murders have not decreased by quite as much as the president said. What’s more, his Chicago comparison is contradicted by city and federal data. Not only has Chicago seen murders fall by significantly more than 10% in recent years, its decline is rivaled by few other large cities. Press officers at the White House did not respond to our request for comment. Chicago has seen 27% fewer murders so far this year than it had at this time two years ago, Chicago Police Department data for mid-October show. Preliminary federal data for 2019 is not yet available, however, so we compared the latest federal data — from 2018 — with figures for 2016. That’s the year Johnson became the city’s top cop. It’s also a year that saw a significant spike in Chicago murders, ending with 765 in all, a total greater than the tallies for New York City and Los Angeles combined. Those figures, which are reported by local law enforcement agencies to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program, show Trump missed the mark on multiple counts. First, the number of murders reported nationwide for 2018 was 6.9% lower than it was in 2016 — not more than 10%, as he claimed. Second, the declines experienced by Chicago during the same period — from 765 murders to 563 — were larger than those seen in all but three of the nation’s 30 largest cities: San Antonio, San Diego and San Jose. It’s a turnaround that’s garnered considerable news coverage over the past two years. In 2018, for instance, the Chicago Sun-Times reviewed FBI data for the previous year and found Chicago alone accounted for 86% of the net decrease from 2016 in murders nationally. That marked decline is also something Johnson turned to in defense when responding to Trump’s attack. ""The president is right about one thing: Violent crime in the United States declined last year for the second consecutive year,"" Johnson said at a news conference Monday. ""But it was Chicago that set the table for those reductions."" Ames Grawert, who leads the quantitative research team at the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, said that although Chicago’s per capita murder rate is still more than four times higher than the national average, the city has made considerable progress in recent years — something Trump’s comments ignore. ""He’s dead wrong on Chicago,"" Grawert said. ""The city’s gotten a lot safer in the past two years and it’s not right to say Chicago’s lagging the national trend … It’s one of the cities that’s led the downward trend of the last two years."" Referring to Chicago, Trump said that ""over the last two years, the number of murders in America and America’s major cities has dropped, unlike here, by more than 10%."" Chicago has seen a nearly 30% decrease in murders over the past several years. That well outpaces the national decline of just under 7%. Rather than holding the nation back, as Trump suggested, Chicago’s progress has contributed to the national decline in violent crime. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire!

Instagram post falsely says flu shot causes fetal death
","As flu season begins, some Instagram users are posting photos with misinformation about vaccines. In one post published Oct. 22, an account called Holistic Health & More, which has more than 165,000 followers, claimed the flu shot can lead to the death of fetuses. ""4250% increase fetal death from flu shot,"" the photo reads. ""CDC failed to tell pregnant mothers of the increase (sic) chance of miscarriage & stillbirth after receiving CDC recommended flu vaccine.""   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, Instagram’s parent company.) It has more than 1,700 likes, and PolitiFact found several copies of the post elsewhere on the internet. (Screenshot from Instagram) As evidence for its claim, Holistic Health & More linked to a website called VacTruth.com, a known publisher of anti-vaccine misinformation. The site requires a password to enter, so we were not able to locate the article in question. Holistic Health & More did not respond to a message requesting more evidence. We found one study that did observe a spike in ""spontaneous abortion,"" or miscarriage, among women who had been vaccinated for the flu — but the bulk of research has found no link between the vaccine and infant mortality. Importantly, medical officials still recommend pregnant women get the flu shot because they can be more prone to severe illness from the flu, as can their babies. We traced the Instagram post to an anti-vaccine blog entry from November 2016. The blog, Health Freedom Idaho, is part of a libertarian movement that opposes health regulations and advocates for nontraditional care.  The blog post links to a 2013 study published by the journal Human & Experimental Toxicology. It looked at miscarriages and stillbirths listed in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a database of reported vaccine side effects maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. RELATED: No, you’re not an ‘active, live walking virus’ for 2 weeks following a flu shot The study found an increase in ""fetal loss reports"" among pregnant women who received the flu shot during two consecutive seasons, from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010. (The season typically spans from fall to spring.) Approximately 587,600 pregnant women were vaccinated with the standard flu shot in 2008-09, and about 2,236,000 pregnant women were vaccinated with the standard flu shot and/or the swine flu vaccine the next year. The study noted a jump in fetal loss reports from four in 2008-09 to 174 in 2009-10.  That’s a 4,250% increase — but it doesn’t mean you should interpret it the way this blogger did. The researchers did not prove that the flu shot was the cause of the uptick. The CDC lists several limitations of this data. The reason why it’s unreliable has to do with the fact that health care providers are encouraged to report any health problems following the administration of vaccines — even if they don’t believe the vaccine was the cause. ""Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information,"" the CDC’s list of limitations reads. ""The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines."" Experts concurred with those limitations. ""The study you cite is trying to do something with VAERS data which is not valid,"" said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Public Health, in an email. ""The results of this study do not contribute to our scientific understanding of the issue."" The study cited by the Instagram post isn’t the only one to link the flu shot with miscarriages. But most research shows that the vaccine is safe, and the CDC recommends it for all pregnant women so they can avoid complications caused by flu infections. One study, which was published in the journal Vaccine in September 2017, compared nearly 500 pregnant women who had miscarriages during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 flu seasons to the same number of women who had normal deliveries during the same period. Researchers found that, of the women who miscarried, 17 had received the flu shot within a month of miscarrying and also received the vaccine the year prior. However, the study’s authors warned that the results did not suggest a causal link between the flu vaccine and miscarriage — and they still said pregnant women should receive the flu shot. On its website, the CDC also doubts the study’s results. RELATED: Bloggers poison truth in claim about flu shot dangers The CDC says the bulk of research supports the notion that the flu shot is safe for pregnant women and that the risk of miscarriage is low. It cites several studies that have found no increased risk of miscarriage as a result of receiving the flu shot. • A 2013 study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology did not find an increased risk of pregnancy loss within four weeks of receiving the flu vaccine. • A 2014 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that, among 57,554 vaccinated and unvaccinated women, the flu vaccine did not lead to an increased or decreased risk of ""preterm birth."" • A 2017 review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System between 2010 and 2016 found no evidence to suggest a connection between the flu vaccine and pregnancy complications. • A 2017 study found that, even when it is administered during the first trimester of pregnancy, the flu vaccine was not associated with structural birth defects. In addition to the CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends that pregnant women receive the flu shot. ""In evaluating all of the available scientific information, there is insufficient information to support changing the current recommendation which is to offer and encourage routine flu vaccinations during pregnancy regardless of the trimester of pregnancy,"" Haywood Brown, former president of the professional association, wrote in September 2017. An Instagram post claimed that there is a 4,250% increase in fetal death from flu shots. That claim can be traced to a 2013 study that found an increase in fetal death among pregnant women between two consecutive flu seasons. But the CDC and experts say the way that data was collected was problematic. The bulk of research shows there is no connection between miscarriage and the flu shot, and the CDC and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend all pregnant women get the vaccine. The Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA50440>],/factchecks/2019/oct/29/instagram-posts/instagram-post-falsely-says-flu-shot-causes-fetal-/

Kolb takes aim at 'Buffalo Billion' job promises
","One of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s high-profile economic development initiatives, the Buffalo Billion, has come under criticism from political rivals and investigation by federal authorities. Cuomo has declared the years-long effort a success and claimed it has boosted the local economy.  When Cuomo announced another pricey economic development endeavor, this time for a silicon carbide fabrication facility near Utica, Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb tweeted his incredulousness.  ""With the Buffalo Billion disaster still breaking every job promise, we get another new ‘economic development project’ from the governor – half a BILLION taxpayer dollars given away touted as job creation. 614 jobs promised … that’s $814,000/job?!"" the Republican from Canandaigua wrote.    With the Buffalo Billion disaster still breaking every job promise, we get another new “economic development project” from the governor – half a BILLION taxpayer dollars given away touted as job creation614 jobs promised … that’s $814,000/job?! https://t.co/t7cEepUgpo Has the Buffalo Billion broken every job promise, as Kolb claims?  We looked at projects that were announced with some job promise attached. Not all Buffalo Billion projects had a promise of a specific amount of jobs. We reached out to Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency, for details on these projects and looked at other sources for information.   Perhaps the most recognizable project is the Tesla solar panel factory at the waterfront site known as RiverBend in South Buffalo, into which the state has invested $750 million. An agreement between the state and SolarCity in 2014 called for the creation of more than 1,450 direct manufacturing jobs at the new facility and more than 2,000 other jobs throughout the state to provide solar services within five years, as well as the creation of 1,440 indirect jobs to support the factory. The expectation was that the solar panel factory would create 5,000 jobs, and under Tesla ownership, that is still the goal. But parts of the agrement have changed. A series of amendments have revised job creation requirements. For example, a requirement to bring in 1,440 jobs through local suppliers was taken out of the agreement. The current agreement calls for 1,460 jobs by April 2020, including 500 manufacturing jobs at the factory, and 5,000 jobs in the state by 2028. Some of those jobs have been created by Panasonic, also located at RiverBend.    According to Empire State Development, there are 730 full-time employees and 43 contingent contractors working at RiverBend, which satisfies the current agreement at this time. If the company does not make its hiring requirements next year, Cuomo said he will fine the company $41.2 million. Job creation goal: Amended and met so far.   • IBM Buffalo Innovation Center: This project was the beneficiary of a $55 million state investment. In 2014 the state announced that the IBM project would create 500 jobs and set a deadline for those jobs at Jan. 1, 2020. The state now reports that ""over 181 IT jobs have been created"" and that the center is working with the state to reach its goal of creating 500 jobs by 2021. Job creation goal: Incomplete, deadline moved.    • Albany Molecular Research Inc.: This pharma research and development project was originally announced in December 2012, with a promise of 250 jobs and a state investment of $50 million. Two years later, he goal was still 250 jobs, but the state subsequently said that AMRI was to create 250 jobs with the help of other partners. The job goal now is 55 jobs, and the company reports having 58 employees in Buffalo, which meets its contractual requirement, according to Empire State Development. Any spin-off jobs that would help the project reach its goal of 250 total jobs are not tracked, the state agency said. Job creation goal: Partially met.    • Buffalo Manufacturing Works: The state is investing $80 million in this facility for advanced manufacturing, and promised that it would create or retain 3,500 indirect jobs over 10 years. The state claims indirect jobs are being created, but it is not tracking them. One concrete job promise as part of this project: Edison Welding Institute, or EWI, was expected to create 30 to 35 jobs within five years, the state announced in March 2014. The center now employs 31 people. Another 30 jobs is expected following a recent expansion. Job creation goal: Partially met.      • Buffalo Institute for Genomics and Data Analytics: Cuomo announced a $48 million investment from the Buffalo Billion in 2014. In July 2014, Empire State Development initially set a goal for the institute to create 490 jobs by Jan. 1, 2019. However, when the employment schedule was finalized in June 2015, the deadline was set at Feb. 1, 2024, according to ESD. An amendment this year pushed the deadline for the 490 jobs back to Feb. 1, 2025. The state agency now reports that the institute has helped create 51 new jobs and is on track to meet next year's cumulative goal of 70 new jobs. The institute has ""key industry partners"" that are expected to create over 200 jobs in Buffalo, and are ""on track"" to meet their commitment to create 490 jobs, according to the state. Job creation goal: Deadline moved, in progress.  • Hotel Niagara: The state spent $4.4 million to acquire this Niagara Falls hotel for redevelopment. Billed as an ""upper-upscale"" 160-room hotel, it was expected to create 67 full-time permanent jobs and open in spring 2019. Construction is scheduled to start this fall, according to Empire State Development. Job creation goal: Project delayed.   • Wonder Falls: Redevelopment of the former Rainbow Centre Mall site in Niagara Falls into a resort, creating 300 direct jobs, according to the governor’s office. The state announced in 2014 that Uniland would be the site developer. The state has not yet given Uniland any funding for the project. Empire State Development said Uniland is continuing its due diligence on this ""very complicated"" project. Job creation goal: Project delayed.    • Athenex: The state invested $225 million in projects in Buffalo and Dunkirk, with a plan to create 1,400 direct and indirect jobs, 500 in Buffalo and 900 in Dunkirk, Cuomo announced on Feb. 11, 2016. In Dunkirk, the goal for direct jobs created is 450 within five years of completion of a new facility, at least 300 of which will be created within the first two-and-a-half years, according to a 2017 company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The facility is under construction. In Buffalo, the job commitment is 250 jobs by October 2020, according to Empire State Development. The state agency reports that there are 176 employees in Western New York, and that the company is ""on track"" to create 500 jobs between Buffalo and Dunkirk by 2022. The state is not tracking indirect jobs. Direct job creation goal: In progress.  • Daemen College/Empire Visual Effects: Cuomo announced this initiative in July 2013, to invest $4.5 million to create a visual effects industry and 150 new jobs within five years. Empire Visual Effects is no longer part of the project, though Daemen College is still educating students to work in the field, according to the state. After receiving $637,000 of $2.5 million in funding, Empire Visual Effects failed to reach its job goals and was sued by the state. The state secured a judgement against the company in April. Daemen received $2 million for equipment and software. Job creation goal: Not met.    Empire State Development’s upstate director of communications, Kristin Devoe, says Kolb is wrong and that ""projects funded by the ‘Buffalo Billion’ are meeting their contractual milestones.""  Kolb’s spokesman, Michael Fraser, sent us a memo with links to news coverage of Buffalo Billion projects from local and national media. Many of the articles talked about the big promises that were made at the outset, and the subsequent failure or delay in meeting job targets. The memo noted that the state comptroller’s office is auditing the Buffalo Billion projects.  Kolb tweeted that the Buffalo Billion has broken every job promise.  Kolb set a high bar by saying it had broken ""every"" promise. That isn't true. Some companies are meeting their contractual requirements. Others are at stages where it isn't clear whether they will make or miss the promised numbers. But a project-by-project analysis shows many promises have been missed, and others have been changed since the deals were announced. Collectively, the analysis shows fewer jobs being created than originally promised.   We rate Kolb’s claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA50900>],/factchecks/2019/oct/29/brian-kolb/kolb-takes-aim-buffalo-billion-job-promises/

No, Lindsey Graham does not support the Green New Deal
","A tiny progressive advocacy PAC with less than $500 on hand bought an ad on Facebook as a media stunt. The Really Online Lefty League’s ad falsely showed Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., endorsing the broad climate change policy known as the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal calls for pretty much the entire country to mobilize and bring the United States to net-zero emissions by 2050 –– the point where it adds no more carbon to the atmosphere than is captured. Government action would be massive. Graham, a firm conservative, has railed against the idea. But in the ad, he says, ""We believe in the Green New Deal."" The man behind the ad, Adriel Hampton, a communications strategist in San Francisco, said he got the idea from a House hearing when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pressed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Could I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?"" Ocasio-Cortez asked. Zuckerberg said, ""Probably."" Here’s what viewers of the ad see and hear, and then, we provide what Graham actually said.  The ad’s headline is ""Conservatives for a Green New Deal,"" and it displays in a corner throughout the minute-and-a-half long ad. It begins with video of Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon talking about the need to protect the environment. Nixon oversaw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and major amendments to both the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, two pillars of American environmental legislation. The ad then shifts to a news conference with Graham at the podium. ""I’m Sen. Graham of South Carolina,"" Graham says. ""I’m here to announce with my colleagues that we care about conservation.""  Graham’s voice continues as images of wind turbines and pine branches gently swaying in the breeze fill the screen.  ""We care about the environment,"" Graham continues. ""From a Republican point of view, I think we need to look at the science, admit that climate change is real. Simply put, we believe in the Green New Deal."" For good measure, the ad shows a picture with Graham and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prime author of the Green New Deal, shoulder to shoulder at a rally, arms raised in victory. The photo of Graham and Ocasio-Cortez is faked, as is his stated support for the Green New Deal  The original photo was of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, taken in 2018. Graham’s head replaced Sanders’. The audio editing of Graham’s news conference was masked by cutting away from the video of the event to add new images. Here are key excerpts from Graham’s event. ""From a Republican point of view I think we need to showcase that we care about conservation –– we care about the environment,"" Graham said. And then he went on: ""We have innovative solutions that are not top-down regulatory solutions,"" he said. ""We believe that you cannot have a healthy environment and destroy the economy and we believe that our friends on the other side care about the environment, but they care so much, they're going to destroy the economy."" Graham did say, ""When nine out of ten scientists say that CO2 admissions are creating a greenhouse gas effect, that the planet is warming up, I believe the nine not the tenth."" He did say ""look at the science, admit that climate change is real,"" but here’s what he said about the Green New Deal. ""There's not one Republican going to vote for anything coming out of the Green New Deal ‘cause it’s  crazy."" An ad from the group The Really Online Lefty League says that Graham supports the Green New Deal. It edited his words to change their meaning, and added to the effect with a doctored photograph.

Fox News analyst correct: Impeachment inquiry is following rules by questioning witnesses in private
","Republicans recently stormed a hearing in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry targeting President Donald Trump to protest the fact that witnesses are being questioned in private. The next day, Fox News political commentator and legal analyst Andrew Napolitano sought to correct them. Before even being asked a question, Napolitano began his Oct. 24 appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" with a statement about the hearings being led by U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of one of three House committees holding the hearings. ""I read the House rules,"" the former New Jersey judge said. ""And as frustrating as it may be to have these hearings going on behind closed doors — the hearings over which Congressman Schiff is presiding — they are consistent with the rules."" He’s right. Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry following a whistleblower’s report suggesting that Trump withheld U.S. military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country into investigating his political rival, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.  A president can be impeached if his or her acts are inconsistent with their presidential duties, whether or not it violates criminal law. It is the job of the House to decide whether there’s enough evidence to show that Trump committed an impeachable offense. First, articles of impeachment would have to pass the full U.S. House of Representatives with a simple majority. Those articles would then be sent to the Senate for a trial. A two-thirds Senate vote is required to convict — that is, remove — the president.  Impeachment is part of the U.S. Constitution. But the rules and procedures for an impeachment are not written in the Constitution, or in a statute; they depend largely on historical precedent.  After making his statement on ""Fox & Friends,"" Napolitano went on to explain that the impeachment inquiry rules were adopted in 2015 by House Republicans and allow for initial interviews of witnesses to be done in secret, much like a criminal case is presented to a grand jury. Any formal impeachment hearing, he added, would have to be done in public, as would a Senate trial. When we asked a Fox News representative for information to support Napolitano’s statement, she sent the following from Napolitano: ""The House rules permit committee chairs to hold closed hearings on matters of national security or intelligence. Diplomatic matters implicate both national security and intelligence. The rules also permit standing committees – as opposed to the full House – to issue subpoenas. As well, they permit interviews of witnesses in secret in order to determine if they are credible enough to present in public."" Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Hans von Spakovsky told us that according to the House of Representatives’ House Practice book, ""an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption of a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges."" And no such resolution was done in this inquiry. But the day after Napolitano’s interview, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the impeachment inquiry is legal.  And Napolitano’s statement was not about in the inquiry generally, but whether interviews can be done in private. Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri professor of law and author of ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump,"" told us the hearings are not ""secret"" in that they are open to members of the three House committees (roughly 100 lawmakers), along with their staff. Bowman pointed us to the 2015 House rules that allow for the private questioning of witnesses in impeachment inquiries. The rules say House meetings shall be open to the public except when a committee or subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, ""determines by record vote that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be in executive session because disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person, or otherwise would violate a law or rule of the House."" Jeffrey Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University and co-author of ""Impeachment: An American History,"" underscored the House’s wide latitude. He told PolitiFact that from a constitutional standpoint, ""the House can choose whatever rules it wants for impeachment hearings—just as the Senate will be able to do the same for its trial, relying on precedent but not bound by it."" One more point before we close. When Republicans controlled the House, its Benghazi committee held nearly all of its hearings behind closed doors, Allan Lichtman, American University history professor and author of ""The Case for Impeachment,"" noted to us. He also pointed out that in the final House report on the matter, then-Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, said:  ""The committee’s preference for private interviews over public hearings has been questioned. Interviews are a more efficient and effective means of discovery. Interviews allow witnesses to be questioned in depth by a highly prepared member or staff person. In a hearing, every member of a committee is recognized — usually for five minutes — a procedure which precludes in-depth in-depth focused questioning. Interviews also allow the committee to safeguard the privacy of witnesses who may fear retaliation for cooperating or whose work requires anonymity, such as intelligence community operatives."" Napolitano said: ""I read the House rules. And as frustrating as it may be to have these hearings going on behind closed doors—the (impeachment inquiry) hearings over which Congressman Schiff is presiding—they are consistent with the rules."" House rules give House committees wide latitude in how to conduct impeachment inquiries and they allow for witnesses to be questioned with only members of the committees and their staffs present. We rate Napolitano’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBE0BC0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/28/andrew-napolitano/fox-news-analyst-correct-impeachment-inquiry-follo/

Graham wrong that House impeachment inquiry denies Trump ‘due process’
","Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced a resolution Oct. 24 to condemn House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. The resolution rebuked the Democratic-led House for interviewing impeachment witnesses behind closed doors and not holding a formal vote to initiate the inquiry.  It also argued that Trump, who faces impeachment for urging Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential challenger in the 2020 election, has not received ""fundamental constitutional protections."" ""The House of Representatives is abandoning more than a century’s worth of precedent and tradition in impeachment proceedings and denying President Trump basic fairness and due process accorded every American,"" Graham wrote in the resolution. But Graham’s claim that Trump has been denied due process — a claim he has repeated on Twitter and in Congress — does not square with the law or the way impeachment works.  One of the cornerstones of American jurisprudence is due process – the right to confront your accuser, call witnesses on your behalf, and challenge the accusations against you. None of this is occurring in the House. We looked into the same ""due process"" claim when it showed up in a White House letter indicating that Trump would not be cooperating with the inquiry. At the time, constitutional scholars told us that complaint lacks legal footing.  In his resolution, Graham wrote that due process for Trump would mean ""the right to confront your accuser, call witnesses on your behalf, and challenge the accusations against you.""  Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop pointed to a presentation Graham showed during a press conference listing rights Graham said President Bill Clinton had when he was impeached, such as the right to have counsel at hearings and the right to challenge evidence, among others. (The House Judiciary Committee did hear testimony from Clinton’s White House counsel, but there’s no constitutional provision requiring it to do so.)  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks about his resolution during a news conference in Washington on Oct. 24, 2019. (AP/Applewhite)​ But when we checked out the White House’s letter, Vanderbilt University law professor Suzanna Sherry told us ""there is nothing that requires Congress to give the president any of the opportunities"" that Graham, like the White House attorney before him, described. If such rights apply at all, they would be granted to Trump during the trial phase, which the Constitution says takes place in the Senate. The House’s job is to determine whether there’s enough evidence to show that the president committed an impeachable offense. Sherry told us that ""an impeachment investigation is analogous to a criminal investigation or inquiry by the police, prosecutor or grand jury"" and that ""the accused has none of the rights"" that White House counsel Pat Cipollone listed in the White House’s letter and Graham listed in his resolution. ""In particular, neither the accused nor his or her lawyer are present at a grand jury hearing, nor is the accused permitted to present witnesses or other evidence or see a transcript,"" she said. ""It is only after charges have been filed and the case has reached the trial stage that criminal defendants have the right to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, have access to evidence, and have counsel present,"" said former federal prosecutor and Stanford Law professor David Sklansky, adding that the due process complaint is ""not a good argument."" ""The role of the House of Representatives in an impeachment proceeding is to investigate and charge, not to try,"" he said. ""The trial comes later, in the Senate."" Even in the Senate, however, it’s not clear that impeachment proceedings require due process protections, because conviction results only in removal from office, experts said. Writing for Reason, Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said due process rights are protected in ""situations where an individual stands to lose her ‘life, liberty, or property,’ none of which is at risk here."" ""To suggest that due process requires that a president facing only loss of office get more rights at the accusatory stage than a criminal defendant facing loss of liberty or even life is not only constitutionally unsupportable, but ludicrous,"" said Frank O. Bowman III, professor of law at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment. Graham’s resolution criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s handling of the impeachment inquiry and the fact that she has not held a formal vote to authorize the inquiry. The Constitution says that the House ""shall have the sole Power of Impeachment"" and the Senate ""shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments."" In the past, the full House has authorized impeachment inquiries, and then the House Judiciary Committee has taken the lead in conducting the investigations, holding hearings on proposed articles of impeachment, and voting on whether to approve them. The final vote on impeachment is by the full House before it moves to Senate for trial. Pelosi has not held a vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry (a majority say they approve of an inquiry), but instead instructed three committees — Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs — to carry out an investigation that Judiciary will use to draft any articles of impeachment. While her process has been different, historians told us Pelosi does not need to hold a full House vote. In the only Supreme Court case where due process issues were raised — a 1993 ruling on the Senate impeachment trial of Judge Walter Nixon — the court found that the Senate’s process was ""nonjusticiable,"" which Bowman said means ""a matter not to be resolved by the courts.""  But a federal judge in Washington on Oct. 25 called the idea that a full House vote is required to initiate impeachment proceedings ""fatally flawed."" In a 75-page district court opinion, Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell wrote, ""Even in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry."" ""All that matters for legitimacy for the House proceedings is to follow the rules of the House as they currently stand and the Constitution,"" said Michael Gerhardt, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina in Chapel-Hill. As the House moves forward, Pelosi could elect to let Trump’s lawyers to participate. Sklansky told us that former President Richard Nixon’s lawyer was allowed to question witnesses called by the House Judiciary Committee and to recommend other witnesses to be called, and that Clinton’s lawyers were also permitted to call and question witnesses called by the committee. At the end of the day, the Constitution gives the House the right to decide how to proceed. In the resolution, Graham wrote that House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry are ""denying President Trump basic fairness and due process accorded every American."" Constitutional scholars said due process rights are not necessarily guaranteed to a president during an impeachment inquiry. If they were, they would be granted during the Senate trial, not the House’s evidence-gathering process. We rate this statement False. CORRECTION: This fact-check has been updated to include the House Oversight Committee among the congressional committees leading the investigations as part of the House impeachment inquiry. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB76BC0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/28/lindsey-graham/graham-wrong-house-impeachment-inquiry-denies-trum/

Exaggerated post connects Clintons, Russia, uranium deal
","Hillary Clinton’s comments about Jill Stein and Tulsi Gabbard inspired a raft of Facebook posts that revived misleading claims about Clinton’s relationship with Russia.  One post published Oct. 21 and shared more than 1,300 times says the following: ""Does anyone else find it strange: The same woman who paid for a Russian dossier to win an election; Whose husband made $500k for a Russian speech; Who sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia; Whose foundation received $150M from Russia; Keeps calling others Russian assets?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As evidence, the post cited Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. We found an Oct. 20 tweet from Kirk that makes the same claims as the post. It was retweeted more than 26,000 times. (Screenshot from Facebook) PolitiFact has investigated four of these claims in the past. We summarized our findings to address each of the post’s claims. The post contains a hint of truth, but it paints an inaccurate picture of Clinton’s ties to Russia. This contains an element of truth, but it isn’t the full picture. The dossier that the Facebook post is referencing was written by former British spy Christopher Steele about President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia. Many of the details included in the dossier were salacious but unverified. It was not written by Russian officials, as the Facebook post seems to claim. In September 2018, we fact-checked a claim from Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., about the dossier, Fusion GPS (the opposition research firm that created it) and how the Clinton campaign was involved. We found that Fusion GPS was hired to work on behalf of the Clinton campaign, but the firm was already investigating Trump at the time. Fusion GPS was originally hired by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative media website. The Democratic National Committee, through its law firm Perkins Coie and for the benefit of the Clinton campaign, hired the opposition research firm to collect information after Trump won the Republican nomination. Then, Fusion GPS hired Steele to produce memos on Trump’s ties to Russia. This is accurate. The source of the claim is the 2015 book ""Clinton Cash"" by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer. During an April 2015 interview about the book on Fox News Sunday, he said something that caught our eye: ""Of the 13 (Bill) Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state."" We rated that claim True. And in the course of our investigation of Clinton’s federal financial disclosure forms, we found that former President Clinton gave a talk in 2010 to a Russian finance corporation. He was compensated $500,000. This is misleading. We rated a similar claim Mostly False. The claim also stems from Schweizer’s ""Clinton Cash."" A chapter of the book suggests a pay-for-play scheme between the Clintons and Russia, accusing them of transferring uranium in exchange for donation money. Part of that chapter stems from a 2007 deal between Clinton Foundation board member Frank Giustra’s company, UrAsia, and Uranium One, a Canadian mining company. Uranium One has mines, mills and land in U.S. states equal to about 20% of the American uranium production capacity. Its actual production, though, is a smaller portion of the uranium produced in the United States, at 11% in 2014, according to Oilprice.com. RELATED: In context: Hillary Clinton on Tulsi Gabbard, the Trump campaign, Russia In 2009, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, bought a 17% share of Uranium One. A year later, it bought enough shares to give it a 51% stake. Since a foreign entity was taking a majority stake in a uranium operation, several U.S. government regulators had to approve the deal. They did, and in 2013, Russia assumed 100% ownership of Uranium One and renamed it Uranium One Holding. In our previous fact-check, we noted that Clinton sat on the committee that approved the sale — but the decision was not hers alone. She also did not have the power to veto the committee’s decision. This is exaggerated. We rated a similar claim Mostly False. Nine people related to Uranium One donated to the Clinton Foundation. But the bulk of the money, about $131 million, came from Giustra — a businessman from Canada, not Russia. Giustra said he sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and about 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state. We haven’t independently verified Giustra’s claim, but if he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One investors drops significantly — from $145 million to $4 million. A Facebook post makes four claims about Hillary Clinton’s ties to Russia before and during the 2016 presidential election. The first, that Clinton ""paid for a Russian dossier to win an election,"" contains a hint of truth (that the Clinton campaign paid the firm that wrote the Steele dossier), but it isn’t the full picture. It’s true that Bill Clinton once made $500,000 by giving a speech to a Russian company. The claim that Clinton ""sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia"" exaggerates the percentage involved and Clinton's role; she didn’t have sole decision-making power over the deal. And it’s an exaggeration to say that the Clinton Foundation ""received $150M from Russia"" — it may be closer to $4 million from Uranium One investors. The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC05B540>],/factchecks/2019/oct/28/facebook-posts/fact-checking-hillary-clintons-ties-russia/

No, Olive Garden is not funding President Trump’s re-election campaign
","Unlimited soups, salads and breadsticks are what Olive Garden is known for (especially the breadsticks). But is the restaurant also ""funding"" President Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign? That’s what one viral Facebook post claims: ""Olive Garden is funding Trump's re-election in 2020. It would be terrible if you shared this and Olive Garden lost business."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But it isn’t true. A quick Google search into the rumor turns up several news articles and fact-checks that debunk the claim. We also previously fact-checked an Instagram post that inaccurately included Olive Garden on a list of companies that allegedly donated to President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. The rumors started to circulate on social media in late August after that list went viral. Shortly after a #BoycottOliveGarden hashtag began trending on Twitter, the restaurant’s official account stepped in: ""We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates."" We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates. When a user responded to the tweet and asked whether Olive Garden’s parent company, Darden Restaurants, donated to PACs, the restaurant responded that Darden ""does not donate to any federal or presidential candidates."" Darden owns multiple restaurant chains, including LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar’s and The Capital Grille. We went to OpenSecrets.org, a campaign finance database run by the Center for Responsive Politics research group, to examine the numbers. The database shows that Darden Restaurants itself has not donated to Trump’s re-election campaign, nor has it made any contributions during the 2020 election cycle. (The same goes for the 2018 and 2016 election cycles.) That’s because corporations are prohibited from making contributions to candidates and party committees, according to the Federal Election Commission. Open Secrets includes a similar disclaimer that reads: ""Organizations themselves cannot contribute to candidates and party committees. Totals include subsidiaries and affiliates."" But donations can be made from PACs affiliated with the company, from the organization’s employees, owners or those individuals’ immediate family members. All the money associated with Darden that’s been donated so far in the 2020 cycle has come from individuals, the database shows. Those donations have totaled $17,332, with $11,899 of that going to candidates, all of them Democrats, and $5,000 going to a PAC that says it supports Democratic leadership. Trump is not among the recipients so far, according to the database. In recent election cycles, however, contributions associated with the organization went to both Republican and Democratic candidates and committees, and came from both individuals and PACs. In the 2016 election, individuals affiliated with Darden – again, not the organization itself – donated $8,407 to Hillary Clinton and $886 to Donald Trump. A viral Facebook post claims that Olive Garden is ""funding"" Trump’s re-election campaign. However, campaign finance data shows that Olive Garden’s parent company, Darden Restaurants, has not donated to Trump’s re-election campaign. Corporations are prohibited from making contributions to campaigns or party committees. Meanwhile, PAC’s associated with the company, as well as individual employees and their family members, have made contributions to both Democratic and Republican candidates.  This rumor is wrong. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC057840>],/factchecks/2019/oct/28/facebook-posts/no-olive-garden-not-funding-president-trumps-re-el/

Trump did not threaten to rename White House for Astros after World Series boos
","After a day in which he announced the death of terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, President Donald Trump attended Game 5 of the World Series in Washington where he was met with some loud boos and taunts of ""lock him up!"" The booing occurred at the end of the third inning when the Jumbotron showed Trump, wife Melania and other guests at the game. On the same night, a viral screenshot of a tweet purportedly written by Trump rhetorically punched back with allegiance to the red state of Texas and its baseball team. ""Fine you boo me DC? Go #Astros, Texas loves me, I get the best kind of love there. I’ll be renaming the White House the Orange House,"" stated the Oct. 27 post, which was posted on Facebook.
