Mitt Romney says there are “25 million Americans out of work”
","
During the Jan. 23, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., Mitt Romney said that ""we have 25 million Americans out of work."" But he’s not correct. 
Officially, there were about 13.1 million unemployed Americans in December 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment statistics. This is the number that’s used to calculate the official unemployment rate, which during that month was 8.5 percent. 
But 13.1 million is only about half of what Romney claimed. What’s going on? 
Here’s the explanation. 
Some critics have long argued that the BLS definition of unemployment is too limiting, since it doesn’t count people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job. So BLS also offers an alternative measure (known to economists as ""U-6"") that factors in both groups. 
Using this measure, BLS in December 2011 found an additional 2.6 million Americans who are ""marginally attached"" to the labor force, meaning they’d be ready to work if a job became available, and another 8.1 million Americans who are working part time but who would prefer a full-time job. 
Together, these three categories added up to 23.8 million people in September 2011, for a total ""U-6"" rate of 15.2 percent, or well above the official unemployment rate. 
So Romney is a little high for the broader statistic -- 25 million as opposed to 23.8 million -- but he’s in the ballpark. The question is whether it’s fair to describe these roughly 25 million people as ""out of work."" 
To make the definition work, you have to include the 8.1 million Americans who are ""working only part-time for economic reasons."" These people would certainly rather have a full-time job. However, we don’t think it’s accurate to describe them as ""out of work."" 
Our ruling 
While the U-6 measurement is not the official gauge of unemployment in the United States, it’s a valid statistic to consider in conjunction with others. However, Romney’s use of the term ""out of work"" seems to be a stretch when about one-third of the ""25 million Americans out of work"" are actually working part-time. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D640C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-there-are-25-million-americans-ou/

Gingrich repeats claim that Freddie Mac, credit unions are ‘government-sponsored enterprises’
","Often criticized for his lucrative work for Freddie Mac, Newt Gingrich has compared the mortgage giant to government-sponsored enterprises such as credit unions and electric co-ops.

He said it again in a debate in Tampa on Jan. 23, 2012, in an effort to portray Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association, as a benign entity that serves citizens -- not an out-of-control bureaucracy that brought down the housing market, as his rivals maintain.

""Government-sponsored enterprises include, for example, telephone cooperatives, rural electric cooperatives, federal credit unions. There are many different kinds of government-sponsored enterprises, and many of them have done very good things,"" said Gingrich, who collected more than $1.6 million in fees from the federally chartered mortgage company.

PolitiFact has checked Gingrich's claim that electric coops and credit unions are government-sponsored enterprises and found it’s not true.

In the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, Gingrich had to explain another wrinkle in his past dealings with Freddie. One of the panelists asked him about his words from 2007: ""I like the GSE, or government-sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac, model.""
   
Gingrich defended his position, much the same way in that debate, saying ""when you look for example at electric membership co-ops, and you look at credit unions, there are a lot of government-sponsored enterprises that are awfully important and do an awfully good job.""
   
How valid is the comparison?

There is one similarity between a GSE and a credit union or an electric co-op. Neither pays federal or state income taxes. But Patrick Lavigne, spokesman for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), said GSE  ""is not a term that I’ve heard applied to electric coops before.""
   
In fact, the term GSE applies to just a handful of very particular institutions. It takes a specific act of Congress to create one, usually to ease the flow of money to a certain industry, like housing or agriculture. Glossaries like Investopedia define GSE’s as ""(p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy.""

When the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSE’s, and the list isn’t long.  There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And that’s it. No electric co-ops. No credit unions.
   
The 2012 White House budget explains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate ""the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers.""
   
A credit union or an electric co-op is created completely differently. They come into being when a group of local investors pool their money. The country’s very first credit union was started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to factory workers in textile mills.  Washington played no role at all.

Later, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local co-ops and credit unions need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entities.  And that’s another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930s when ""farmers would each throw $5 into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines.""
   
Back then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate, but Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit from the federal Treasury for more than $2 billion. ""They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself,"" said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered GSE’s for over two decades.
   
The deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says ""the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... That’s what allowed it to grow.""
   
Our ruling

Gingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and do find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs. Congress created Freddie Mac, as it does every GSE,  by passing a specific law to bring it into being. Freddie Mac has stockholders and a direct line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The term, Government Sponsored Enterprise, applies only to a handful of financial entities listed in the federal budget.
   
None of those characteristics apply to credit unions and electric cooperatives. Once again, we rate Gingrich’s statement Pants On Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/97867b65-b96a-435e-9e0d-1f2ac55a5f4f",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4ABC00>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/newt-gingrich/gingrich-repeats-claim-freddie-mac-credit-unions-a/

Newt Gingrich repeats claim that he balanced the federal budget four times as speaker
","During the Jan. 23, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Newt Gingrich repeated a claim he’s made about his record in balancing the budget as House speaker. ""When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets, the only time in your lifetime, Brian, that we've had four consecutive balanced budgets,"" Gingrich said. ""Most people think that's good."" We’ve checked this -- such as during the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa -- and never found it to be accurate. Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs. The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion. But that’s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House. It’s also worth noting that even the two balanced budgets for which Gingrich can claim some credit were collective accomplishments by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. Our ruling Gingrich was off-base with this claim -- again. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it’s a stretch for him to take credit for anything more than two of those years. We rate Gingrich’s claim False.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/638b4582-eb6f-4e7e-b410-2bfdee9e7dd5",[<zip object at 0x00000280969661C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-repeats-claim-he-balanced-federal-bu/

Was Mitt Romney the director of a company charged with Medicare fraud? AFSCME ad says so
","
A full head of hair on Mitt Romney’s head disappears as he morphs into a very bald, smiling Rick Scott. It’s an ad from AFSCME, a public workers union, that seeks to equate the Republican presidential candidate with Scott, the current governor of Florida. Scott’s approval numbers have been among the lowest in the country is recent months.

""What kind of businessman is Mitt Romney?"" the ad asks. ""While Romney was a director of the Damon Corp., the company was defrauding Medicare of millions. Prosecutors called it ‘corporate greed run amok.’ The company was fined $100 million. But Romney himself made a fortune. Corporate greed … Medicare fraud. Sound familiar?""

We’ve written frequently about Scott’s time running hospital chain Columbia/HCA and its troubles surrounding Medicare (You can read up on it here.) Here, we’re checking the ad’s initial claim, that while Romney was ""a director of the Damon Corp., the company was defrauding Medicare of millions.""

Romney’s ties to a company charged with Medicare fraud haven’t been discussed much lately, but it’s old news to people in Massachusetts.

The Boston media investigated the facts of the case when Romney ran for governor in 2002 and won. It’s also addressed in The Real Romney, a new biography by reporters with the Boston Globe.

The story begins in 1989, when Romney was the head of Bain Capital, a private equity firm that specialized in buying troubled companies, turning them around, and then selling them for a profit. That year, Bain bought Damon Corp., a medical testing company based in Needham, Mass.

Bain took the company public in 1991, and Romney served on the company’s board of directors. In 1993, Bain orchestrated a sale of the company to Corning Inc., getting a handsome return on its investment and earning Romney himself $473,000, according to The Real Romney. After the sale, Corning closed the main facility in Needham, laying off 115 people.

In October 1996, federal prosecutors announced that Damon was agreeing to pay $119 million in both civil and criminal fines after pleading guilty to defrauding Medicare. The company was  providing doctors with forms that didn’t make clear what tests included, so doctors were checking off additional tests that weren’t necessary, according to the Globe’s summary of the government’s case.

The overbilling went from 1988 through 1993, prosecutors said. ""This is a case, pure and simple, of corporate greed run amok,"" U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said when the settlement was announced.

Romney was never implicated in the case. His role became an issue later, in 2002, when he ran for governor. Romney claimed that he helped uncover the fraud, but Globe reporting put that claim into question. The Globe reported that court records showed fraudulent activity occurred under Bain’s watch, and that prosecutors gave the credit to Corning for stopping the fraud. Aides later said Romney’s remarks that he helped uncover the fraud were misunderstood. We asked the campaign for comment, but we didn’t hear back.

In The Real Romney, authors Michael Kranish and Scott Helman note that Romney seemed to have two views about what happened at Damon. ""On the one hand, he said he hadn’t known what was going on at Damon; on the other, he said he’d helped to put a stop to practices later found to be fraudulent. One thing that looked good at Damon was the bottom line for Bain. In the end, it was a profitable deal for both the firm and Romney, however tainted by legal troubles and layoffs it may have been.""

Our ruling

The ad claims that, ""While Romney was a director of the Damon Corporation, the company was defrauding Medicare of millions."" That's true, but Romney was never implicated personally with the fraudulent activity at the company, and it was one of many companies with which Bain was involved. It’s also difficult to assess whether Romney knew about the fraud or should have known, and what he did to stop it. So the statement is correct but leaves out context. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809705B080>],/factchecks/2012/jan/23/afscme/was-mitt-romney-director-company-charged-medicare-/

RULING CHANGE: Has Rob Cornilles locked up endorsements from Independent, Democratic and Republican mayors?
","
PolitiFact Oregon has the great dishonor of reversing a ruling today.

We freely admit we have egg on our face. If we were a cat, our ears would be lowered and our head down. If we were a dog, we’d be looking up at you with sad dog eyes. You get the picture.

Last week we ruled True a statement by the Oregon Republican Party that Republican Rob Cornilles had the endorsements of a variety of local mayors, including Democrat, Republican and Independent. The upper case ""I"" means he had the backing of a registered member of the Independent Party of Oregon, which is a third party group.

Well, we were wrong.

We checked Cornilles’ list of mayors online, and confirmed their party registration. As we suspected, most are Republican. But we found six non-Republicans, including three registered Democrats.

We originally emailed Amity Mayor Michael Cape and asked him if he was registered with the Independent Party, as opposed to being a non-affiliated voter. He said yes. But it turns out that he’s actually a non-affiliated voter.

The Independent Party of Oregon was officially recognized by the Secretary of State in January 2007. Previously, people registered with no party could call themselves independent voters. Now they best stick to calling themselves non-affiliated voters.

Cape said in a later interview that he considered himself independent, as in neither Republican nor Democratic. This is a confusing issue. When we first contacted the Yamhill clerk’s office, a person there said Cape was registered as Other-Independent. Which is not the same as registering with the Independent Party.

Had the Oregon Republican Party used a lower case ""i"" they would have been accurate. They say that’s what they intended all along. But capitalization makes a difference. We’re very sorry for the confusion but facts are facts. We change our previous ruling from a True to a False.

Richard Codey claims he made pension payment when he was governor
","
New Jersey governors have skipped or underfunded state payments into the pension system, but during his roughly 15-month tenure as the chief executive, state Sen. Richard Codey claims he paid the bill.

Codey addressed his record of making pension payments during a Jan. 16 interview on WOR-AM with former New York Gov. David Paterson. A caller from New Jersey noted how the ""pension funds have not been funded from both sides"" over the last 11 years.

Codey (D-Essex) explained how state regulations now require the governor to make significant payments, and then added: ""And by the way, when I was governor, I did make the payment into the pension fund.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Codey made a pension payment -- but it was far from the total amount recommended at the time.

Codey, who served as governor between November 2004 and January 2006, was only responsible for putting together the fiscal year 2006 budget. In that fiscal year, the state made a total of about $164 million worth of payments to six pension funds, according to data provided by Bill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury.

But in fiscal year 2006, the total combined payment recommended by actuaries to be made to those six funds was roughly $1.45 billion, according to Quinn. So, the state only covered about 11.3 percent of the recommended payments.

Those payments were authorized by Codey through the fiscal year 2006 budget, but they were technically made under Codey’s successor, Jon Corzine.

In a phone interview, Codey acknowledged he made a partial payment and argued he never said he made a full payment. When we told him his statement referred to making ""the payment,"" the former governor suggested we were nitpicking.

""I said I made a payment into the pension fund,"" Codey told us. ""I did make a payment and that’s true. What I said was true.""

Asked why he didn’t make the full payment, Codey pointed to the $4 billion budget cap he had to grapple with. ""It is what it is. There’s demands all over the place. You’ve got to make those kind of decisions.""

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Codey claimed, ""when I was governor, I did make the payment into the pension fund.""

It’s true that the state made a partial payment during fiscal year 2006, whose budget Codey had developed. But the state didn’t make ""the payment"" in total that was recommended at the time.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Sherrod Brown says unemployment among young vets tops 20 percent
","
Hiring armed forces veterans is nothing new for GrafTech International, a high-tech manufacturer based in Cleveland for 125 years. The practice has been beneficial, the company says, because veterans have the traits of leadership, teamwork and dedication it seeks.

Now looking to hire more veterans for up to 45 jobs at its Lakewood and Parma, Ohio, facilities, GrafTech has found an added benefit: tax incentives.

The VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which provides job training for service members making the transition to civilian life, also provides tax credit of up to $9,600 to companies hiring unemployed veterans. (VOW stands for Veterans Opportunity to Work.) The legislation was signed into law in November.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, who co-sponsored the act, visited GrafTech to highlight the need for it.

""Today, many veterans -— including our young veterans -— face an unacceptably high unemployment rate,"" the Democrat said. ""More than one in five of veterans aged 20 to 24 can’t find a job to support their family or to ease the transition to civilian life.""

More than one in five means an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent among young veterans.

That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. It's considerably higher than the national jobless rate. We asked Brown's office where the figure came from.

They referred us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose monthly Current Population Survey provides official statistics on employment and unemployment in the United States.

The bureau collects data about veterans, in tracking various segments of the workforce, and last October it updated a detailed report on the employment situation of veterans in 2010, the latest figures available. Among the findings:
  
It’s worth noting that the BLS considered that 21.9 percent rate as ""not statistically different from the jobless rate of young male non-veterans,"" which was 19.7 percent. But Brown wasn’t citing the statistic to contrast it with the unemployment of non veterans.

Rather, he used the GrafTech appearance and the statistic to argue that the country owes it to service members to help them transition back to civilian life.

""Service members who risk their lives protecting our nation shouldn’t have to wonder whether or not they’ll be able to find a job when they leave the service,"" Brown said. ""Just as we invest in our service members while they’re on the battlefield, we should do the same when they return home.""

Brown accurately cited the jobless rate for younger veterans. That the non-veteran rate is also high is a piece of additional information that helps provide a clearer picture of the unemployment rate for all younger men.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Brown’s claim rates Mostly True.

Ga group uses claim to back up pay-to-play proposal
","
The presidential race isn’t the only place where there has been some bare-knuckle debate recently.

Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and Common Cause Georgia Executive Director William Perry went one on one during a recent broadcast on WXIA-TV, and it got quite heated.

The main topic was Atlanta’s process of awarding contracts to individuals and companies hoping to run businesses at the city-owned Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Perry’s argument: It wasn’t transparent and lends itself to accusations of cronyism. Reed’s take: It was open, and Perry’s complaints were hypocritical.

Perry wants Atlanta to enact pay-to-play legislation that would restrict campaign contributions to elected officials or candidates running for office. Perry’s proposal would cap campaign contributions for those doing business with Atlanta at $250 per business entity. He wrote a letter to Reed outlining the idea and said he supports similar legislation for the state of Georgia and in Fulton County.

""It is the state law in 11 states and has withstood court challenges, so we’ll continue to push it because it is good public policy,"" Perry said during the WXIA broadcast on Jan. 4.

Perry’s claim about 11 states having pay-to-play laws prompted us to test the accuracy of his claim on the Truth-O-Meter.

During the Jan. 3 Atlanta City Council meeting, Perry and Councilman H. Lamar Willis went back and forth on several details concerning Perry’s pay-to-play idea. Perry defended the idea.

""It is the state law in 11 states and has withstood court challenges, so we’ll continue to push it because it is good public policy,"" Perry said.

Perry said the 11 states he was referring to were California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Vermont and West Virginia. Perry told PolitiFact Georgia he may have underestimated the total. He provided us a May 2010 report by the law firm Perkins Cole to back up his argument. The report on pay-to-play statutes lists 19 states with some sort of pay-to-play guidelines.

Some of those states, such as New Jersey, prohibit businesses with state contracts exceeding $17,500 from making contributions to any candidate, state or county political committee. New Jersey’s law has an exemption for highway contracts.

Other states in the report that Perry cited have guidelines that are more narrowly defined. Here are some examples from the report Perry sent us: 


The report notes two states that had their pay-to-play initiatives removed. In Florida, state lawmakers repealed two statutes concerning pay-to-play. In Colorado, the state Supreme Court overturned its law that sole-source government contractors and their families cannot contribute to political campaigns during the contract or two years afterward. The court ruled it violated the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Natalie O. Wood, an official with the National Conference of State Legislatures, published a study of pay-to-play laws for her organization in 2009. Her report concluded that there were nine states with comprehensive pay-to-play laws: Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia. Each state has laws that essentially limit people doing business with the government from making campaign contributions to elected officials or candidates.

In an interview, Wood said she would cut that list to eight states because of the Colorado court decision. She discussed the distinction between comprehensive pay-to-play laws and the rules in some states that focus on sole-source contracts.

""My understanding of the issue of no-bid versus competitive-bid contracts is that in those states that only focus on the former, the ban on contributions would only impact companies who obtained their contract without having to bid on it,"" Wood said.

A few states have seen legal efforts to challenge pay-to-play laws, arguing the guidelines violate free speech. Some have argued the laws aren’t strong enough.

New Jersey Comptroller Matthew Boxer complained in September that the state’s pay-to-play law ""does not work"" because some local governments exploit a loophole that allows them to award contracts to any vendor — regardless of how much money they contribute to candidates — as long as they use a ""fair and open"" process.  

Perry told us he stood by his claim.

""Some [states’ pay-to-play laws] are extremely specific while others are expansive,"" he said. ""In at least 11 states, there is some recognition that it is not a good idea to allow campaign contributions to decision makers.""

There are variations of pay-to-play laws in at least 11 states, as Perry said. However, some are more detailed and comprehensive than others, as Wood said. The laws in some states seem to be less rigorous than what Perry has proposed in the city of Atlanta. We believe Perry’s claim needs some clarification and rate it as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3BEA00>],/factchecks/2012/jan/23/william-perry/ga-group-uses-claim-back-pay-play-proposal/

Cuccinelli says D.C. council has banned lethal trapping of rats
","
Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli smells a rat.

He is outraged by a law passed by the District of Columbia’s city council in 2010 that regulates how exterminating companies capture pests.

Cuccinelli, a Republican, has been sharply critical of the Occupy movement, an international grassroots protest largely directed at corporate power. During two recent interviews, Cuccinelli has discussed published reports about an increase in rat populations around Occupy DC camps a few blocks from the White House. Then he’s turned to the D.C. pest-control law and painted it as an example of ridiculous regulation.

The D.C. law ""doesn’t allow them to kill the dang rats,"" Cuccinelli said in a Jan. 13 interview with CNSNews.com, a conservative web site. ""They have to capture them, and capture them in families.""

Cuccinelli said the law requires relocation of the trapped rats and voiced concern that D.C. exterminators would transport vermin across the Potomac River and set them free in Virginia.  As a last case resort, he said, the law allows euthanizing pests.

Cuccinelli took a similar swipe at the law in a Jan. 10 interview on WMAL radio. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh picked up on Cuccinelli’s comments and pilloried the statute and its author - D.C. Councilwoman Mary Cheh.

We were curious whether D.C. really does require rats to be captured by non-lethal means. So we scurried for an answer.

The seven-page law cited by Cuccinelli does prohibit pest control companies operating in DC from using various traps to catch some kinds of urban wildlife such as raccoons, possums and skunks. In these cases, it forbids pest control companies from setting traps using glue, snares, leg holds, harpoon, and body crushing devices.

The law also calls for catching animals alive and relocating whole pest families when possible. Though ""non-lethal means"" is listed in the law as the preferred way for dealing with city wildlife, it does allow for euthanasia techniques based on recommendations from the American Veterinary Medical Association.

But here’s the catch: The pardon does not extend to rats in D.C.

Kiara Pesante, Cheh’s director of communications, noted that the first page of the law specifically exempts ""commensal rodents"" -- common rats and mice that pilfer human food.

So it seemed that Cuccinelli got it wrong. We called his office for an explanation.

Brian J. Gottstein, Cuccinelli’s director of communications, acknowledged the law exempts some rats and mice species, but stressed it would still regulate trapping other ""non-commensal"" rodents, including the rice rat and the deer mouse.

We spoke to officials at the National Pest Management Association, the Humane Society of the United States and the D.C. Department of Health. They all said they are not aware of rice rats existing in Washington. Wikipedia says the rice rat dwells in wetlands through most of the eastern U.S. There are deer mice, and during colder months they do get into homes in leafy areas around the capital, such as Rock Creek Park.

But a deer mouse is not a rat. In his comments to CNSNews.com, Cuccinelli talked about rats and made no distinction among them. He said the law calls for live trapping of ""these rats"" while discussing vermin populations around the Occupy D.C. camps.

""The rat that we find in D.C. is indeed the Norway rat,"" said Najma Roberts, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Health.

The Norway rat is a commensal rodent and the critters are not protected by D.C. law.

Our ruling:

Cuccinelli said a D.C. law passed in 2010 forbids lethal trapping of rats.

But the law doesn’t pertain to the common type of rat living in the nation’s capital. That particular vermin, the Norway rat, can still be caught using lethal means.

Cuccinelli’s spokesman said the law would still regulate catching another type of rat - the rice rat. But there’s no evidence those rats exist in the city.

The attorney general made no distinction among rats in his comments. We think most listeners would conclude from his comments that the D.C. council by and large has repealed the death penalty for rats.

That’s wrong and ridiculous. We rate Cuccinelli’s claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFB520C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/23/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-dc-council-has-banned-lethal-trapp/

Writing in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Lasee referenced a study of President Barack Obama’s initiative on Wisconsin. He said that according to the study, ""nearly 90 percent of people with (health) insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30 percent.""

We don’t know whether the study’s prediction will turn out to be accurate.

But what about Lasee’s characterization of the study? Do nearly 90 percent of people in Wisconsin who have health insurance face a cost increase of more than 30 percent? 
'Obamacare' changes 
Lasee’s campaign for the seat held by retiring Democrat Herb Kohl has been overshadowed by those of his fellow Republicans: former govenor Tommy Thompson, former congressman Mark Neumann and state Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.

By attacking ""Obamacare,"" Lasee is taking on the landmark health care reform that became law in 2010, although many provisions don’t take effect until 2014. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have explained, the law leaves in place existing insurance systems -- employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor -- while reducing the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to help those with modest incomes buy insurance. The law also requires almost every American to acquire insurance or pay a fine, a provision that has been challenged and will result in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the law’s constitutionality in June 2012.

Lasee is among countless people who have debated how much folks will have to pay for health insurance once Obama’s plan fully takes effect.

The study Lasee cited in making his claim was commissioned by the administration of Wisconsin’s previous governor, Democrat Jim Doyle, who was succeeded by Republican Scott Walker in January 2011.

Released in July 2011, the study was done by Gorman Actuarial, a Massachusetts firm specializing in health insurance, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology health economist Jonathan Gruber.

Lasee's evidence 
When we asked Lasee’s office for evidence to back his statement about cost, chief of staff Robert Kovach cited a summary of the study produced by the Walker administration -- which opposes the reform law.

The summary says 87 percent of people in Wisconsin who buy their own health insurance -- rather than getting it from an employer or the government -- will see their premiums increase an average of 30 percent.

But there’s a big problem right off the bat: Lasee said the 30 percent cost increase applies to all Wisconsinites who have health insurance. The summary he cites refers to the much smaller group of people who buy their own insurance.

In any case, rather than relying on the summary, let’s go to the study itself.

It says that as of 2009, 4 million people in Wisconsin under age 65 had health insurance. That included more than 3 million who got insurance from their employer and only 180,000 -- or just 4 percent -- who bought it on their own.

Of that small group, 87 percent will see their premiums increase an average of 41 percent once federal health care reform fully takes effect, the study says.

Even at that, as the Journal Sentinel pointed out in its story about the study, the cost estimate isn't an apples-to-apples comparison because, for many people, the higher costs will bring higher benefits. Some people will pay more because they will be able to afford health plans with better benefits; some will be forced to buy more insurance than they want; and those who can afford insurance now but opt not to buy it will be required to buy it.

We went back to Kovach, Lasee’s aide, who acknowledged that the figures Lasee cited misquote the study. He said he believes Lasee’s larger point was that most people in Wisconsin with health insurance will pay more for it under federal health care reform. But that remains to be seen.

Our conclusion

Lasee stated that, according to a study of the impact of federal health care reform on Wisconsin, ""nearly 90 percent of people with insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30 percent.""

Those figures apply only to the fraction of people who buy their own health insurance, not to all Wisconsinites with insurance. And Lasee admitted he misquoted the study.

"['New Jersey', 'Income', 'Taxes', 'Lou Greenwald']","
Lou Greenwald claims governor’s proposed income tax cut benefits millionaires more than middle-class families
","
Millionaires, pack your bags.

Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald claims the wealthy can take a trip to paradise with the money they’ll keep under the 10 percent income tax rate cut proposed by Gov. Chris Christie.

Middle-class families, meanwhile, won’t save enough to stock their cabinets for a week.

""Let's be clear about this - Gov. Christie's income tax plan may sound nice, but it would save a family earning $50,000 per year just $80.50 and a family earning $100,000 per year just $275, all [the] while ... millionaires get a $7,265.75 tax break,"" Greenwald (D-Camden) said in a Jan. 17 press release. ""Under this tax cut, middle-class families don't save enough for a week's worth of groceries, while millionaires save enough to go on an exotic vacation.""

The state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services analyzed the impact of the governor’s proposed income tax cut for the Assembly Democrats. The cut would be phased in over three years.

Savings are estimated by reducing the amount of income tax joint filers pay by 10 percent. According to the analysis, a couple with a taxable income of $50,000 pays $805 in income tax now. Under Christie’s proposal the same couple would pay $724.50, or $80.50 less.

A couple with a taxable income of $1 million pays $72,657.50 now. A 10 percent reduction in that bill equals $65,391.75, or $7,265.75 less, according to the analysis.

James R. Hines Jr., co-director of the law and economics program at the  University of Michigan Law School, said it’s fair to estimate the impact of an income tax rate cut by calculating the reduction in the tax bill. ""There’s nuances but by and large, it’s roughly right,"" he said.

Under the proposed cut higher income filers benefit more than lower income filers. Hines said that’s expected. Suppose you say ""the lion’s share of the benefits go to the rich,"" he said. ""It tells you the lion’s share of the taxes must be paid by the rich.""

Christie also responded to that charge in a recent WNYC interview: ""Those folks who are paying more in a progressive system, when you cut those taxes are going to get more. That's the definition of a progressive system.""

So Greenwald’s numbers are reasonable, but what about his comparisons: Are savings under the proposed income tax cut too little to cover a week’s worth of groceries for a middle-class family? And can a more than $7,000 tax break pay for an exotic vacation?

Federal data and a review of travel websites back the assemblyman up.

Greenwald based the grocery figure ""on paying bills and providing for a family in the real world, such as going to the supermarket for a week’s worth of groceries to feed 3 growing kids, with healthy meals for breakfast lunch and dinner,"" according to a spokesman.

A family of four with school-age children on average spends between $233 and $283 a week on food with a moderate-cost to liberal meal plan, according to November 2011 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture

A two-week vacation for two, including airfare, accommodations, taxes and fees, from Newark to Fiji costs more than $7,500 in a package listed on the travel website Kayak.com. Expedia.com prices a similar vacation in Bali at about $5,800.

Our ruling

After the governor announced his proposal to cut income tax rates by 10 percent, Greenwald said in a press release that the cut wouldn’t be enough to pay for one week of groceries for a middle-class family, but millionaires would save enough to take an exotic vacation.

Greenwald is right: those who make more in New Jersey will save more from an across-the-board income tax cut. And federal data and vacation package deals listed on travel websites back up the assemblyman’s comparisons.

We rate the statement True.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Texas', 'Efrain De La Fuente']","
Efrain De La Fuente says jurors in most states, but not Texas, can ask questions of witnesses in trials
","
A Travis County judicial candidate, Democrat Efrain De La Fuente, told a local group that he favors letting jurors pose questions of witnesses during trials provided the questions are vetted through a judge.

""That’s seeking the truth,"" De La Fuente, who seeks the judgeship of the 167th Criminal District Court, told the Central Austin Democratic Forum on Nov. 29, 2011. ""We shouldn’t be paying lip service to this thing we call fact-finding. Looking for the truth. Everybody – most of the states in this country have come on board. Texas needs to come on board.""

We had no idea Texas was out of step.

Asked for backup information, De La Fuente’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, replied by email that jurors in civil trials in Texas are already allowed to ask questions of witnesses, though De La Fuente’s ""most states"" comment was referring to civil and criminal trials.

Wick pointed us to a November 2011 blog post about a 2007 decision by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland upholding the presentation of two written questions from a jury to a witness. Nationally, that decision says, most state courts that have taken up the question of letting jurors ask questions of witnesses have left that up to trial judges, though a few courts have held juror questioning to be an error or abuse of discretion.

A 1992 decision by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in Morrison v. State, barred juror questioning in Texas criminal cases. In its ruling, the court aired concern that jurors would imperil their impartiality by questioning witnesses. ""We know of no authority establishing or authorizing jurors to ask questions of witnesses in the criminal jurisprudence of this state and therefore find the same to be error,"" the court said. 
Of courts around the country that do allow juror questioning, the Maryland decision says, many suggest procedures a court should follow. The decision includes guidance from the Kansas Supreme Court stating: ""The trial court should not solicit questions and should only permit them for purposes of clarification. The testimony of a witness should not be interrupted by questions from jurors. Jurors should submit questions in writing and without any discussion with other jurors. Counsel should be afforded the opportunity to object outside the presence of the jury. The trial court must determine the relevancy of the questions. The trial court should instruct the jury not to draw any inference if a question submitted is not asked. The trial judge, rather than counsel or jurors, should question the witness. Finally, counsel should be given the right to further examine the witness following the jury’s questions.""

Legal experts in Texas guided us to Tracy Christopher, a justice on Houston’s 14th Court of Appeals, who has studied juror questioning in civil trials. In a telephone interview, Christopher said that when she was a trial judge, she permitted jurors to question witnesses a few times. ""It is a useful tool,"" she said. ""It does slow down the trial slightly.""

The Texas Supreme Court has not acted on any case testing juror questioning in civil trials, Christopher said, though lower state courts of appeal have concluded that juror questioning is permissible -- with safeguards such as the judge soliciting written questions whose admissibility is determined with the jury and witness out of the courtroom.

So, the highest criminal appeals court in Texas has naysayed jurors asking questions in criminal trials. But Texas judges are free to let jurors ask questions in civil trials.

Seeking precise information on practices in other states, we read a 2007 report by the National Center for State Courts, which describes itself as an independent court improvement organization. The report states that according to surveys of lawyers and judges, written questions from jurors are ""mandated for criminal trials in three states, prohibited in 11 states, and left to the sound discretion of the trial court in the rest,"" or 36 states. ""In civil trials, juror questions are mandated in four states, prohibited in 10 states, and left to the discretion of the trial judge in the rest,"" the report says.

In a telephone interview, an author of the report, Paula Hannaford-Agor, told us Texas ranks among five states -- the others are Georgia, Minnesota, Mississippi and Nebraska -- with court opinions outlawing juror questions in criminal trials. Of late, she said, the practice is strongly discouraged in seven other states -- Illinois, Louisana, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma and South Carolina -- though no laws or court rulings bar it.

Hannaford-Agor said juror questioning of witnesses in Texas civil trials may be allowed, yet it occurs infrequently.

Make that very infrequently. In the center’s surveys of Texas judges and attorneys, 1.5 percent of 518 respondents said the judge had allowed juror questions during the respondents’  latest trial in civil court. The surveys were taken from 2004 through 2006, Hannaford-Agor said.

As we corraled this information, De La Fuente told us in an interview that he knows juror questioning is already possible in Texas civil courts. He said that he usually tells voters as much, though did not do so at the Democratic forum. If elected, he said, he intends to urge legislators to permit juror questioning in criminal trials.

Our ruling

As De La Fuente said, Texas is among the minority of states that bar juror questioning in criminal trials. Contrary to what he said at the forum, however, Texas is among the majority of states allowing judges to permit juror questions in civil trials. We rate his overly sweeping claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F5340>],/factchecks/2012/jan/22/efrain-de-la-fuente/efrain-de-la-fuente-says-jurors-most-states-not-te/
"['Health Care', 'Public Health', 'States', 'Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin state Senate Democrats']","
Is GOP state Sen. Patrick Testin to blame for $25M in lost coronavirus relief? Not quite.
","Wisconsin Democrats hammered Republicans after the state lost out on $25 million in federal coronavirus relief funding for unemployment benefits due to slow action by the GOP-controlled Legislature.  But instead of targeting Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald of Juneau or other top-ranking Republicans, Democrats zeroed in on  …  Patrick Testin? In a May 8, 2020 news release headlined ""25 million reasons not to trust Patrick Testin,"" the Democratic committee of the state Senate pointed the finger squarely at the first-term Republican from Stevens Point, with executive director Eric LaGesse declaring: ""It is unfathomable that he would refuse to do his job when it means helping Wisconsin workers and families that are being hit the hardest by COVID-19."" Testin is chairman of a key health-related committee and like his colleagues, he can lobby leaders to schedule floor sessions. But the power to determine when the Assembly and Senate meet largely lies in the hands of leadership. How does the claim rate? A quick refresher on the lost funding: Wisconsin could have received $25 million through the federal CARES Act to help pay for unemployment benefits as long as it did not require residents to wait one week to receive aid.  But Republican leaders in the Senate and Assembly didn’t schedule floor sessions to take up a package backed by Gov. Tony Evers that, among other things, waived the waiting period, until three weeks after the federal legislation passed. Republicans thought Wisconsin could be reimbursed retroactively to early March. They were wrong, so the state has to foot the bill for those benefits. Where does Testin fit in? When asked for backup for the claim that Testin was to blame for the lost money, LaGesse argued in an email that the senator didn’t push for quicker action on the relief package. As chairman of the Committee on Health and Human Services, he asserted, Testin should be ""the leading voice in his caucus on health issues.""  LaGesse criticized Testin in other arenas, including his opposition to extending Gov. Tony Evers’ stay-at-home order to May 26. But the statement from the Democratic committee focused primarily on Testin’s role in the loss of federal funding, so we will, too. The Democrats’ statement raises an unusual question: Is it Testin’s ""job"" to ensure the legislature meets? Not quite. The Senate and Assembly primarily meet during scheduled floor sessions, which wrapped up for 2020 earlier this year. That meant lawmakers needed either a special session or an extraordinary session to take up the relief package. The key difference between the two: who can call them. Per the state constitution, only the governor has the authority to call the Legislature into a special session — a move Evers used to no avail to persuade lawmakers to delay the April 7, 2020 spring election. Evers, a Democrat, did not call for one here. Instead, the Assembly and Senate convened an extraordinary session on April 14 and 15. Lawmakers can do that either through a joint resolution or petition, or at the direction of each house’s committee on organization.  Each organizational committee is composed of leaders from each party -- a group that does not include Testin.  To be clear, a single lawmaker can’t call an extraordinary session.  Committees are a different story. Chairs like Testin have broad leeway to call meetings throughout the biennial session, which ends on Jan. 4, 2021. The Health and Human Services committee last met on March 17, 2020 and didn’t take up any matters related to COVID-19. But even if Testin had called a committee meeting, it couldn’t have taken up the relief package because committees can only vote on legislation that has been referred to them by leaders. And this measure was not before his committee. So, Testin could’ve lobbied his colleagues to meet. But that’s about it. Running for reelection, for starters.  Testin is facing a challenge from retired Stevens Point police officer Paul Piotrowski in November 2020 in what Democrats view as one of their best opportunities to flip a Senate seat. That potential vulnerability is likely part of what motivated state Democrats to target Testin. In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Testin’s campaign noted the U.S. Department of Labor issued administrative rules for the CARES Act on April 30 -- two weeks after the vote -- that quashed the retroactive provision. The implication: Republicans didn’t know that would happen, so they didn’t feel pressured to rush the relief package. The federal agency told the state Department of Workforce Development on April 20 that the state couldn’t be reimbursed for benefits paid before the relief package became law, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. That, too, came after the Senate and Assembly voted. But Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation did warn GOP leaders of that possibility on April 3, 2020. So the urgency was clear. Still, that doesn’t change the fact Testin, who ultimately voted for the plan, had no ability to get it done on his own. The Wisconsin State Senate Democratic Committee blamed Testin after Wisconsin lost $25 million in federal funding, saying the senator refused ""to do his job."" The rules for convening legislative sessions mean Testin -- a first-termer who is not part of leadership -- couldn’t do much more than ask leaders to take up the package sooner.  But that hardly puts the full weight of the lost money on him. That leaves us with a claim that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Trump wrong that hydroxychloroquine studies only gave drug to dying patients
","Count President Donald Trump as hydroxychloroquine’s No. 1 fan. At a press conference, Trump told reporters he’s putting his health where his mouth is. ""Couple of weeks ago I started taking it,"" he said May 18. ""Because I think it’s good. I’ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you right. I’m not going to get hurt by it."" To be clear, the Food and Drug Administration cautions that hydroxychloroquine can hurt people. It increases the risk of an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to cardiac arrest.  Trump didn’t mention that. He did, however, dismiss the research that cast doubt on whether the drug does any good against COVID-19. ""If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,"" Trump said at a May 19 press event. ""They were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement."" Later that day, Trump clarified that he was talking about a study of Veterans Administration patients.  Trump spoke as if there were only one negative study. There have been three: the one on VA patients and two larger ones. They all reached the same conclusion that outcomes with hydroxychloroquine were the same as without it.  The earliest work on hydroxychloroquine was small studies, sometimes with as few as 30 patients, and for each study that showed promise, another study found no benefit. The mixed results spurred more research. The analysis Trump criticized came in late April, when researchers at the universities of South Carolina and Virginia released their paper on 368 VA patients with COVID-19. They looked at who got hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or both, and they tracked who ended up on a ventilator or died. The paper was released without peer review.  They found that hydroxychloroquine, with or without the other drug, had no effect on whether someone had to be put on a ventilator. Worse, hydroxychloroquine increased the chances of dying. The authors cautioned that all of the patients involved in the study, regardless of outcome, were men over 65. And they also factored in a range of underlying conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and other health risks. Those issues were found in roughly equal numbers across all groups of patients. Ultimately, about 75% of the patients getting hydroxychloroquine lived. The survival rate was close to 90% for those who didn’t get it. In early May, two studies emerged based on patients treated in the nation’s biggest COVID-19 hotspot, New York City. Both investigations were much larger than the study of VA patients. The study that appeared May 7 in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the medical records of 1,376 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. Their results echoed the first study on hydroxychloroquine. ""There was no association between administration of the drug and a lower chance of dying or winding up on a respirator,"" said co-author Neil Schluger, the head of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Now, it’s fair to say that the patients who got the drug were, as a group, a bit worse off than those who didn’t. In particular, their blood oxygen levels were lower when they were first admitted. Schluger said that didn’t matter. ""The difference in oxygen levels between the two groups we compared were fairly small and not clinically important,"" Schluger said.  These patients were not close to death, Schluger said. ""Overall, about 83% of the patients in our cohort survived, and that survival had no association with hydroxychloroquine administration,"" he said. On May 11, the JAMA Network of the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study of 1,438 randomly selected COVID-19 patients treated at 25 New York area hospitals. That group of researchers tracked whether they died in the hospital. They, too, found no connection between outcomes and use of hydroxychloroquine. They also found no impact from the use of another drug, azithromycin. About 75% of patients getting hydroxychloroquine survived, compared with about 87% who were not given the drug. Like the other study, this one found that patients who got the drug were in worse health at admission than those who didn’t. They might have lower oxygen levels, or some other condition such as diabetes or obesity.  But by examining patients’ full medical records, both teams were able to use stronger analytic tools to filter out the impact of differences in underlying health. Once that was done, they could make apples-to-apples comparisons of the effect of hydroxychloroquine on people who got the drug and those who didn’t. The authors of all studies acknowledged that working with patient records after the fact isn’t the final answer, and they called for more research. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump spoke about ""the one survey,"" a study of VA patients and hydroxychloroquine, and said it was ""bad"" because ""they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old. Almost dead."" There have been three studies, not just one. None of them found that the drug reduced the death toll. As a group, the patients getting the drug were not on the verge of death. Across three studies, about 75% to 80% of the patients receiving the drug survived.  To say they were in very bad shape is also off the mark. Health issues were found in members of both the treatment and non-treatment groups. That allowed researchers to tease out the impact, and make informed comparisons that took these health differences into account.

Blog post wrong on what Bill Gates said about COVID-19 vaccine
","We’ve seen many social media posts lately that falsely claim Bill Gates is responsible for, or will somehow profit from, COVID-19. Most claims are focused on the coronavirus vaccine. The Gates Foundation has been financially supporting the development of a vaccine and posting articles explaining the projected vaccine timeline. A recent Facebook post links to an article titled, ""Bill Gates Explains That The COVID Vaccine Will Use Experimental Technology And Permanently Alter Your DNA.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Waking Times blog post heavily quotes Bill Gates’ blog, specifically when he explains how RNA COVID-19 vaccines could be developed and how they would create antibodies.  RNA vaccines have been shown to create ""a safe and long-lasting immune response in animal models and humans""  in clinical and preclinical trials. However, licensed RNA vaccines have never been produced before.  The body creates proteins by translating mRNA, the messenger molecules from DNA. By introducing a new mRNA vaccine to a few cells in the human body, those cells will produce the proteins of ""a disease-specific antigen,"" and the immune system can create an antigen-specific antibody. Basically, it creates only the parts of a pathogen that the body reacts to and creates antibodies to bond to. This way, the body can easily attack the disease when it recognizes its cells. The second half of this claim, that these vaccines would ""permanently alter your DNA"" is incorrect. An article in Frontiers on Immunology analyzed new studies that found mRNA ""cannot potentially integrate into the host genome and will be degraded naturally."" Basically, after the messenger molecules create antigens for the body to react to, they will naturally stop being used and break down. The Waking Times blog shared on Facebook asserts that a new COVID-19 RNA vaccine ""will not be tested in any significant or standard capacity"" and that readers should prepare to be ""guinea pigs in the largest global health experiment ever."" But Gates makes it very clear throughout his own blog post that scientists are not just relying on RNA or DNA experiments to create the first worldwide COVID-19 vaccine. ""As of April 9, there are 115 different COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the development pipeline,"" Gates writes. RNA and DNA vaccines are easier to produce and they are testing them right now, but ""even if an RNA vaccine continues to show promise, we still must continue pursuing the other options."" Contrary to the explosive claim that the entire world would be treated as ""guinea pigs"" for a new RNA or DNA vaccine, Gates explains how any COVID-19 vaccine will go through a rigorous, but also shortened, testing period. The New England Journal of Medicine has projected that they can shorten the usual 5-year period of vaccine testing to three short testing trials over 18 months. Gates says later in his article that it’s a priority to ""make sure we have good real-world evidence that the vaccine is completely safe to use."" RNA testing will be done on small groups before it reaches the entire world. The first round of clinical testing with an RNA vaccine for COVID-19 began on May 16th. The dosage test has only 105 subjects and is projected to take at least a year to complete. Our Ruling A blog post shared on social media reads ""Bill Gates Explains That The COVID Vaccine Will Use Experimental Technology And Permanently Alter Your DNA."" This is inaccurate. Gates never said that the first licensed COVID-19 vaccine would use experimental technology or permanently alter DNA; he said specifically that ""we don’t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like."" The most recent research also shows that RNA vaccines, which are being tested for COVID-19 right now, do degrade naturally and don’t alter DNA permanently.

Despite Parson's claim, not all businesses could open May 4
","Missouri reopened on May 4 with Gov. Mike Parson beginning the first phase of his ""Show Me Strong Recovery Plan."" In an April 27 tweet, Parson said, ""All Missouri businesses can open Monday, May 4, under our new order as long as new guidelines are followed."" Counties and cities in the state had extended stay-at-home orders past the May 4 date Parson had in mind for a Missouri reopening. St. Louis County, the hardest-hit county in the state, and the city of St. Louis had stay-at-home orders in place until Monday. Their policies were based on Health Commissioner Fredrick Echols’ Order No. 7, which was dated April 16, and were in place at the time the governor announced the first phase of reopening. Jackson County (not including Kansas City), began reopening May 10. So, have all businesses been able to open in Missouri? No, it’s more complicated than that. We reached out to Parson’s office. While acknowledging our email, there was no information provided. In a radio interview with KFTK/97.1 FM in St. Louis on April 29, Parson noted he did not have the power to make counties comply with the reopening plan, but he could exert ""political pressure"" to do so. Parson’s order was a minimum, allowing for localities to make more restrictive measures.

Donald Trump doesn’t meet the definition of morbidly obese
","President Donald Trump brought his health to the national coronavirus conversation on May 18 when he told reporters that he was taking hydroxychloroquine, a longstanding anti-malaria drug, as a preventative measure against COVID-19. Trump’s confidence in the drug against COVID-19 has not been supported by most studies. In fact, physicians say that the drug has serious side effects for patients, especially if they have pre-existing conditions such as heart problems. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper she was concerned for other reasons. In the interview, Cooper asked Pelosi what she thought of Trump saying he is taking the drug.  ""I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group,"" Pelosi said. ""He’s morbidly obese, they say.""  Pelosi’s comment probably was meant to get under Trump’s skin. Trump has ridiculed other people’s heights and weights in the past, while others have questioned whether he’s been accurate in describing his own height and weight. But morbid obesity, or severe obesity, is a term of science, and weight is a risk factor for COVID-19. We decided to see what we could find out. Pelosi’s office did not offer a comment. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump responded to Pelosi’s comments at a May 19 news conference, calling Pelosi ""a sick woman"" with ""a lot of mental problems.""  Officially, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not define the threshhold needed for someone to be considered ""morbidly obese."" Instead, the CDC says that ""Class 3"" obesity, sometimes categorized as ""extreme"" or ""severe"" obesity, is defined as having a body-mass index, or BMI, of 40 or higher. Other medical sources list a definition of ""morbidly obese"" as equivalent to a BMI of 40 or higher. Some available data about Trump comes from his most recent periodic physical exam. In a 2019 memo, Trump’s physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump was 6 feet, 3 inches tall and 243 pounds. Trump, who was 72 at the time, had gained 4 pounds since his 2018 exam, when his previous doctor, Ronny Jackson, said Trump’s ""overall health is excellent"" but ""he would benefit from a diet that is lower in fat and carbohydrates and from a routine exercise regiment."" Officially, Trump’s height and weight would correlate to a BMI of 30.1, just a bit over the 30.0 level to be considered obese — the lowest of three levels. That is not high enough to count as Class 3 obesity. Based on the 2019 physical exam, Trump ""would not be considered morbidly obese at this time,"" said Lucas Carr, a professor in the department of health and human physiology at the University of Iowa. Paresh Dandona, the head of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the State University of New York, agreed with this observation. Some critics, such as MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, say they think Trump is neither 6-foot-3 (a New York driver’s license listed him as 6 feet, 2 inches), nor does he weigh around 240 pounds. ""By the way he's picked up, magically picked up, he's 2 inches taller now than he was a couple years ago, right?"" Scarborough said on his MSNBC show in 2019.  ""I'm sorry, I'm a guy that weighs about 240, 241,"" he said. ""This guy, this guy is, he's pushing 300, there's no doubt about it,"" Scarborough said. ""Maybe he's 270, maybe he's 280."" The Washington Post went so far in 2016 as to have experts guess Trump’s weight. Their answers: 250-260 pounds; 228-242 pounds; 252-255 pounds; at least 240 ""maybe more"". To have a BMI above 40, with the highest of those weights (260 pounds), Trump would need to be shorter than 5 feet, 8 inches. He’s not. Pelosi does have a point that an individual’s age and weight are risk factors for worse outcomes after a coronavirus infection. Many studies connect obesity with COVID-19 complications, and data has shown higher death rates for older patients than younger ones. The CDC warns on their ""Defining Adult Obesity"" page that ""severe obesity (a BMI of 40 or higher) may raise risk"" of a severe reaction to COVID-19.  The CDC also warns that ""older adults, 65 years and older, are at higher risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19."" Trump is 73. Pelosi called Trump ""morbidly obese."" Based off of his declared height and weight, Trump has a body mass index of 30.1. This places him into the lowest of three levels under the CDC’s definition of obesity. Even if the public numbers are a bit shy of reality, Trump would have to be substantially heavier to meet a level of severe, or morbid, obesity. We rate Pelosi’s claim False.

The agent was called to discuss notes he took about a drug trafficker previously involved with Guzmán, in an attempt to highlight discrepancies. Alex Cifuentes, a former Guzmán associate, took the stand and testified that former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto took a $100 million bribe from the kingpin. But there was no testimony about any American officials. A post shared by Ted Nugent claims that federal agents ""closed"" the courtroom when Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán started naming Democrats he paid off.  This claim is unfounded.

No, Gov. Tony Evers did not want to shut down Wisconsin for nine months
","Wisconsin’s coronavirus response has been in a state of flux since the state Supreme Court threw out Gov. Tony Evers’ safer-at-home order on May 13, 2020. Absent statewide rules, counties implemented a patchwork of policies, some of which were quickly dropped. Other local orders remain, but expire on different dates. Evers’ administration proposed new rules, only to withdraw them after Republican blowback. In the middle of this uncertainty, a Facebook post claiming to detail Evers’ plan spread among conservatives and ended up on the Republican Party of Kenosha County’s page.  ""HEADS UP WISCONSIN!! This is no joke!,"" the post reads. ""Evers is proposing a new plan, a 150 day shutdown of the state (5 MONTHS!) followed by a 120 day extension.""  It goes on to ask readers to call 10 members of a key legislative committee to voice their outrage, suggesting the Evers order included forced masks, forced testing, forced quarantines and even forced vaccinations. (Never mind that no vaccination currently exists.) But that is not at all what the administration proposed.  Let’s take a look. When asked for evidence to back up the Facebook post, the Republican Party of Kenosha County said it reposted the message from someone else and pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the Evers administration’s proposed rules.  The message, which urges people to copy and paste it to share, has been shared more than 600 times based on the Kenosha County GOP post alone. It was also posted to the Recall Tony Evers Facebook group and shared by the La Crosse Tea Party.  It’s unclear where the post originated.  On May 14, 2020, Evers approved what’s called a statement of scope put together by the state Department of Health Services. The document is the first step in the rulemaking process that Evers’ administration must operate under after the Supreme Court ruling.  A Republican-led committee could veto the proposed rules, which Sen. Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, asked Evers to withdraw saying it could not win support. On May 18, 2020, the governor said the proposal would be his last attempt at a statewide rule to contain the virus. DHS’ statement of scope said the agency would implement temporary measures to limit gatherings, enforce social distancing and ensure businesses protect employees and customers from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The proposal also promised to establish a phased approach to reopening the state’s economy.  All in all, DHS’ statement of scope largely replicated the plan -- which Evers had dubbed the ""Badger Bounce Back"" -- that was struck down by the state Supreme Court. DHS officials admitted as much, writing that ""the proposed emergency rule may re-articulate some or all the parameters specified in Badger Bounce Back."" ""The proposed rule will implement measures to reduce and slow the rate of infection of COVID-19, to reduce strain on the health care system, to mitigate economic hardship, and to save lives,"" the document states. Nothing in the statement of scope suggests state officials planned to shut down the state for 150 more days, plus an extension. Nor did the previous order that it’s based on. (And remember, the Evers order challenged by the GOP was 13 days away from expiring when the Supreme Court ruled.) The Evers administration’s Badger Bounce Back plan provided for a phased reopening of the economy as the state achieved certain public health criteria. Among them: Increased testing and contact tracing, a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percentage for 14 days and a decline in influenza-like illnesses. The state had met five of six benchmarks on May 12, a day before the court’s ruling came down.  Wisconsin state statutes do specify that emergency rules can only remain in effect for 150 days, unless extended by no more than 120 days. But that should not be confused with DHS’ statement of scope, which was done under the emergency rules framework but did not establish a set time for reopening.  Moreover, a phased reopening based on public health is hardly a complete shutdown as the Facebook post implies.  When asked about the post during a May 18, 2020 media call, the governor’s response was brief. ""That’d be a lie,"" Evers said. A Facebook post shared by conservative groups in Wisconsin said Evers was proposing a five-month shutdown of the state, plus a 120-day extension. At no time did the Evers administration suggest this. The Supreme Court ruling meant Evers had to turn to the emergency rulemaking process through the Legislature. That process includes limits and timetables for any such rule. The Facebook post wrongly conflates that timetable with the governor’s plan to reopen the state. As such, it is entirely incorrect. What’s more, the post encourages people to spread misinformation.

No, COVID-19 won’t respond to antibiotics, despite findings from new autopsies
","When it comes to treating COVID-19, the world has it all wrong, a Facebook post claims. ""Autopsies prove that COVID-19 is a disseminated intravascular coagulation — pulmonary thrombosis. It is now clear that the whole world has been attacking the so-called coronavirus pandemic wrongly due to a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error,"" the lengthy post begins. Autopsies performed by Italian pathologists, the post continues, show that COVID-19 ""is not pneumonia, but it is disseminated intravascular coagulation, or thrombosis, which ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. If this is true for all cases, that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ve seen the terms so many times, but it doesn’t hurt to review. COVID-19 is an abbreviation for coronavirus disease 2019 — a name given by the World Health Organization three months after the disease was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December. As the various names suggest, the novel (as in new) coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 is a virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. As Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist Ben Neuman describes it, ""COVID-19 starts out in the lungs like the common-cold coronaviruses, but then causes havoc with the immune system that can lead to long-term lung damage or death."" The technical term cited in the Facebook post — ""disseminated intravascular coagulation"" — is ""a rare but serious condition that causes abnormal blood clotting throughout the body’s blood vessels,"" according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a U.S. government agency. ""It is caused by another disease or condition, such as an infection or injury, that makes the body’s normal blood clotting process become overactive."" As the post indicates, Italian pathologists did perform autopsies on people with COVID-19.  But their study didn’t contradict what COVID-19 is; it merely reported on how the disease can damage lungs. The pathologists examined the lung tissues of 38 COVID-19 patients who died in hospitals in northern Italy. They concluded that ""the virus remains in lung tissue for many days, even if in small quantities, possibly being the trigger of the mechanism that leads to and feeds lung damage."" Their findings were posted in a preliminary study April 19. That study has not been peer reviewed, meaning it has not yet been evaluated by experts for formal publication in a medical journal.  One of the pathologists on the study, Dr. Aurelio Sonzogni of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, confirmed to PolitiFact that the study does not contradict the fact that COVID-19 is a virus that cannot be treated with antibiotics. Rather, his study found that lung damage caused by blood clots is one possible effect of COVID-19. The study has been accepted for publication in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, a London-based medical journal, he said. ""Autopsies prove that COVID-19 is"" a blood clot, not pneumonia, ""and ought to be fought with antibiotics,"" a Facebook post claimed,"" and the whole world has been wrong in treating the ""so-called"" pandemic. The novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 is a virus. Viruses do not respond to antibiotic treatment; antibiotics only work on bacterial infections.

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness that in some cases causes pneumonia. Another effect, according to the autopsies in Italy, is lung damage caused by blood clotting.

Yes, Pennsylvania’s governor blocked a company that makes American flags from operating during the p
","Veterans groups in Pennsylvania typically prepare for Memorial Day by placing small American flags beside the headstones where fallen service members have been laid to rest. When a state lawmaker from Erie County learned that the coronavirus might scuttle that sacred tradition, he posted about it on Facebook. ""Gov. Wolf is not allowing companies that distribute U.S. flags to ship out orders to be placed at veteran’s graves for Memorial Day,"" Pa. House Rep. Brad Roae posted on Facebook on May 11. We wondered whether Wolf had really blocked Pennsylvania-based American flag distributors from operating during the pandemic. Roae, a Republican, did not return a call seeking comment on his Facebook post, which has now been shared more than 7,000 times. But it looks like he was right. Not only did Wolf exclude FlagZone, a manufacturer located in Gilbertsville, from his original list of life-sustaining businesses permitted to operate during the pandemic, his administration doubled down and rejected the company’s application for a waiver.  FlagZone is one of the only American flag manufacturer in Pennsylvania and one of only a half dozen across the country. The company typically distributes more than six million small stick flags annually.  Casey Smith, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development, told The Reading Eagle that the Wolf administration’s top priority is protecting the health and well-being of Pennsylvanians, and that flag-making, while patriotic, simply wasn’t ""life-sustaining."" ""Memorial Day celebrations and ceremonies are a staple in our nation, and many Pennsylvanians will need to adjust their routine this year to accommodate our new normal,"" Smith said. ""We encourage all Pennsylvanians to honor our nation’s fallen in their own special way."" Turns out the flags had already been manufactured and were sitting in a warehouse. FlagZone President Daniel Ziegler said it would only take a few workers to ship 400,000 flags that had been ordered by 24 different Pennsylvania counties in anticipation of Monday’s federal holiday. Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties were among those waiting to receive their orders.  When State Sen. Scott Hutchinson learned about FlagZone’s woes, he also called on Wolf to ease restrictions imposed on the company. ""I see no reason why the time-honored and solemn tradition of placing flags at veterans’ graves could not be continued this year,"" Hutchinson, a Republican who represents Butler and other Western Pennsylvania counties, said in a statement sent to reporters via email. ""Certainly placing the flags in cemeteries could be done while practicing the social distancing Gov. Wolf recommends."" On Monday, FlagZone got some good news. The state cleared the way for the company to ship some flag orders even as it held firm that flag manufacturing is not essential during the pandemic. ""We’re just excited to get these flags out after months of being shut down,"" Ziegler told The Reading Eagle. ""Hopefully, when a family goes to the gravesite of a loved one who was a veteran they will now see that they were not forgotten."" Smith, of the community and economic development department, said in an interview that special approval from the state is not required for limited shipping activities and communicated  that to FlagZone. Roae posted on Facebook that Gov. Wolf had blocked companies that distribute American flags from shipping orders ahead of Memorial Day. Wolf initially blocked FlagZone from operating during the pandemic and then rejected the company’s request for a waiver. A state official later said the company did not need special permission to ship limited numbers of flags. However, the company didn’t understand this until the state said so, especially since the clarification came days after the Wolf administration rejected FlagZone’s application to resume operations.

There’s no evidence that wearing standard masks is harmful to your health
","To mask or not to mask? That’s a question many people are asking themselves — and arguing about — these days. Federal health officials initially discouraged masks for the general public, only to revise their guidance later. To make matters more complicated, social media posts are claiming that wearing a mask can be more dangerous than going without one. One post, in part, reads: ""It is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria that can end up in your mouth & down into your lungs. I have learned that there are many harmful effects of rebreathing Carbon Dioxide (CO2)."" Another says: ""Mask wearing reduces oxygen up to 60%. Increases risks of CO2 poisoning. Causes increased face touching. Viruses and bacteria saturate the outside. Touching mask and surfaces spread germs. Contaminants sit within mask fibers, get reinhaled. Fresh air is vital for immune health!"" The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There’s no evidence that wearing masks is harmful for the general public, except for people with certain medical conditions.  Carbon dioxide is a natural byproduct of the body and part of the air, and people breathe it in and out all the time. Too much CO2 can certainly be life-threatening, but only at significantly high concentrations, experts say. Hypercapnia, a condition that arises when there is too much carbon dioxide in the blood, can cause headaches, drowsiness, vertigo, double vision, disorientation, tinnitus, seizures, or suffocation due to displacement of air.  CO2 makes up only about 0.04% of the air we breathe, and is considered life-threatening when its concentration is greater than about 10%. The posts don’t specify the kinds of masks or how long someone would need to wear one to generate unhealthy CO2 levels, but medical experts say the risk is quite low for the general public who wear a typical cloth or surgical mask. Linsey Marr, a professor in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech, said it's possible that loose fibers in the masks can be inhaled, as one post claims, but ""contaminants in these fibers would have off-gassed into the air already, unless the mask is fresh off the assembly line."" Prolonged use of certain face masks, particularly tight-fitting medical-grade ones like the N95 respirator, can cause problems for people with respiratory illnesses.  ""I don’t think that the general public wearing homemade face masks really poses a CO2 poisoning issue,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told PolitiFact. ""There is data, however, that prolonged use of an N95 mask can increase blood CO2 levels, and therefore we do not recommend people wear N95 masks for a prolonged period of time. We also do not recommend the general public wear N95 masks."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the general public wear cloth face masks in areas where social distancing isn’t possible, and says certain medical-grade masks, like the N95, should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients.  The CDC also says that facial coverings should not be placed on ""young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance."" The agency told Reuters that while CO2 that slowly builds up in masks over time, the level is mostly tolerable for people exposed to it.  ""You  might get a headache but you most likely (would) not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2,"" Reuters quotes the CDC as saying. ""The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2, and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia.""​  Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard’s School of Public Health also said he hasn’t seen any credible data to support the posts. ""I wear masks every day for hours and hours at a time and I've never once suffocated and passed out from CO2,"" Tsai said. ""On the margins we could probably find extreme cases where someone, somewhere with some condition has had an issue with a mask but that's not the average. There is absolutely no data to suggest that wearing a standard surgical or cloth mask under normal situations is deleterious to your health."" Facebook posts say that wearing a mask causes health problems, particularly from breathing in too much exhaled carbon dioxide. There is no credible data to back that up. Experts say prolonged use of N95 respirator masks can increase blood CO2 levels for people with breathing problems, but those masks are not recommended for the general public, and using ordinary cloth or surgical masks poses little or no risk from CO2.  We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971A3780>],/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/theres-no-evidence-wearing-standard-masks-harmful-/

New York pension fund does not need a federal bailout
","Some conservative federal lawmakers continue to oppose sending more money to New York and other states hard-hit by the new coronavirus.  The chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and some of his colleagues sent a letter to President Donald Trump. More federal funding for states forces citizens of one state ""to pay for the poor decisions made in another state,"" Biggs wrote, according to a story about the letter in The Hill.  ""States like New York, Illinois and California have been vocal in their demands for funding to bail out their pension systems, which were failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak, and other programs that aren’t related to this crisis. While these states in particular prove the negative impacts of poor budgeting, bloated spending, and high taxes, the federal government should not be further backfilling the budget of any state or local government,"" Biggs wrote, according to The Hill. Biggs shared the story on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.  Like Biggs, other Republican politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, criticized requests for help from states with high rates of infection. We wondered if Biggs was correct in saying that New York has been demanding federal funding to ""bail out"" its pension system, which was ""failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak, and other programs that aren’t related to this crisis.""  The National Governors Association, a bipartisan organization, is calling for $500 billion in federal funding for states, and New York supports that request, said Freeman Klopott, press officer for the state Division of the Budget.   Biggs said New York’s pension system was ""failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak.""  An analysis of the pension systems in all 50 states in 2017 by the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts, released in June, found that New York was one of only eight states that had at least 90% of its pension obligations funded. New York had assets to cover 94.5% of its pension obligations. E.J. McMahon, who analyzes state finances at the conservative Empire Center for Public Policy, said no bailout is needed for New York’s pension system, ""which by public-sector standards is among the best-funded in the nation.""    New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees the pension fund, has called the fund ""well-funded and strong,"" despite the economic disruptions related to the pandemic. DiNapoli said in a statement that a bailout is not needed and has not been requested.  The pension systems in other states Biggs mentioned, Illinois and California, have different situations. Illinois has one of the three worst-funded systems, at 38.4% funded, and officials there have asked for a bailout of the pension fund.  California's is close to being funded at the average ratio of all the states, at 68.9%, according to Pew, but it has since suffered. Biggs' home state of Arizona trails New York and California, at 62.2%, according to Pew.  We were also interested in the second part of Biggs’ claim, regarding ""other programs not related to this crisis,"" because of reports that New York’s finances were precarious before the pandemic. According to the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, before the coronavirus, New York faced a $7 billion budget gap. The subsequent economic downturn has worsened the state’s finances.   ""The shortfalls the state is experiencing in the current year are caused by tax revenue shortfalls attributable to the current crisis,"" said Dave Friedfel, director of state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission. Friedfel, however, criticized some of the state’s budget priorities, which pre-date the pandemic, including state aid to wealthy school districts, ""ineffective economic development programs,"" and spending more on Medicaid than the budget authorized.  Before the pandemic, the state was expecting a 7% increase in revenue, but now it is expecting a 14% decline in revenue, said Klopott of the state Division of Budget.  A state estimate on April 25 puts the loss of revenues at $13.3 billion this year and $61 billion over the next four years.  ""In the absence of federal funding to offset that loss, we’re preparing a plan to reduce state spending by $10.1 billion, which will reduce support for hospitals, police, firefighters, teachers, and the not-for-profits that provide services to the most vulnerable New Yorkers, including the elderly, children, and the homeless,"" Klopott said.  In an op-ed for the New York Daily News, DiNapoli pleaded for billions in unrestricted aid for New York, writing that lost state revenue as a result of the state’s weakened economy ""stands to trigger significant reductions to schools, hospitals and a broad range of other vital services — cuts that would add to the human and economic damage brought on by COVID-19.""  Other experts we consulted said that states' financial struggles are attributable to the current crisis.  Lucy Dadayan, who leads the nonpartisan State Tax and Economic Review Project at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said that all states, regardless of the affiliations of their political leadership, will need federal funds, because all states are affected by lost tax revenue due to closed businesses.  Richard Auxier, also with the Urban Institute-Tax Policy Center, said state and federal governments turned off the economy, cutting revenues to pay for everything that states pay for, such as public health, education, police protection, and roads and bridges.  We reached out to Biggs’ spokesperson to ask for evidence to support this claim three times through email and left a telephone message with his office. We did not receive a response.  Biggs said that New York was one of several states demanding federal funds to bail out pension funds. He also claimed that New York and other states want federal funds to pay for programs not related to the pandemic.  New York’s pension fund was one of the strongest in the country, according to a nonpartisan, nationwide analysis published in 2019, before the crisis hit state budgets. The New York state comptroller said that the pension system has not requested federal funds.  The other part of Biggs’ statement – that the funding will pay for programs not related to the pandemic – is correct but misleading. The tax receipts that fund the full range of state governments have been sharply reduced by the pandemic. The federal funding sought by states would partly offset those pandemic losses. We rate this claim False.

We found no evidence of proposals or legislation that promoted the use of implanted microchips to fight COVID-19.  Other news outlets including FactCheck.org and Reuters have also debunked claims that philanthropist Bill Gates planned to use microchip implants to combat coronavirus. This claim about microchips may have originated from a misinterpretation of a statement Gates made about possibly using ""digital certificates"" for health records on immunity. But he never said those certificates would be contained in microchips going into people.  Gates’s interest in digital certificates may have also triggered false claims that he was pushing tracking bracelets and ""invisible tattoos"" to monitor Americans under lockdown. Fauci, too, has spoken about digital certificates of immunity. ""You know, that’s possible,"" Fauci told CNN when asked if he could imagine a time where Americans carried certificates of immunity. ""It’s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not. This is something that’s being discussed. I think it might actually have some merit under certain circumstances."" However, PolitiFact could find nothing to support the claim that Fauci said he wants every American microchipped. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971A9A80>],/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/dr-fauci-didnt-say-americans-should-be-microchippe/

Video of kitchen worker blowing on food wrappers is at least three years old
","In a widely shared Facebook video, a woman wearing what looks like a white baker’s hat and a jacket with an ID card pinned to the lapel appears not to realize she’s being recorded. She’s working in front of an espresso machine and appears to be blowing on small paper packages — like cupcake wrappers — to separate them so that she can put pastries inside.  ""CHECK THIS OUT,"" the video caption on the March 14 post says. ""CORONA VIRUS / DROPLETS IN FULL FORCE …. LET THIS GO VIRAL."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It’s noisy in the video, and two more people can be seen in the background, including a man rolling dough. But like the woman in the foreground, neither of them is wearing a mask.  Using InVID, we searched for other places that this video has appeared online. In recent days and weeks, many people have shared it on social media. One tweet, from March 15, says: ""You can wash your hands ALL day long, use alcohol afterwards and protect yourself from the virus as much as you can ... then this happens at your favorite restaurant and you wonder where the covid is coming from."" Another one from March 12 says: ""There is no point in washing your hands, rubbing alcohol, using a mask, but keep eating coxinha. #coronavirusbrasil""  But this video didn’t make its first appearance online in March. We found it published four months ago, on these Russian sites in March and April 2017, and on gfycat.com in March 2017. Certainly, watching someone in a commercial kitchen handle food as the woman in the video does could concern viewers anytime, not just during a pandemic.  Paul Dawson, a professor of food, nutrition and packaging sciences at Clemson University, told us that this ""is definitely NOT an advisable practice regardless of COVID."" ""There are several infectious diseases that can be transferred from the oral cavity,"" he said in an email. ""The only additional question is how long will the packaged food be held before someone eats it. The longer before someone consumes that food, the less chance that the contamination that may have been placed there by the person blowing on the wrapper will survive."" The caption on this Facebook post, and others who have posted the video online, portray the clip as having been recorded recently amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.  In reality, it was taken at least three years ago, long before the first case of the new coronavirus was reported in late 2019.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A53140>],/factchecks/2020/may/19/viral-image/video-kitchen-worker-blowing-food-wrappers-least-t/

States do use masks to contain COVID-19 in prisons
","Health officials and governors in states hit hard by COVID-19 are recommending masks to help contain the spread of the virus. But if masks really work, a Facebook post asks rhetorically, why aren’t governors using them more in jails and prisons that have become COVID-19 hotspots?  The post — accompanying images of governors Mario Cuomo of New York, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California — claims the three Democrats have ""released thousands of dangerous prisoners into the public to kill innocent people and cause stress to our citizens,"" and that the governors ""make"" citizens wear masks.  ""If the masks actually work to prevent COVID-19,"" the post continues, ""then why didn’t we just hand them out to all inmates … instead of releasing them to prevent the spread?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is inaccurate on several fronts. Medical experts now agree that face coverings help slow the spread of the coronavirus, and the states cited in the post have distributed masks to inmates.  Meanwhile, states that are releasing inmates are considering the potential danger to the public in deciding which ones to release. Across the nation in response to the coronavirus, many more inmates are being released from local jails — which hold people charged with crimes or convicted of low-level crimes — than from prisons, which mostly hold people convicted of felonies. That’s according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, and the New York Times. (In Florida, an inmate released from the Hillsborough County jail, where he was being held on nonviolent drug charges, was charged with second-degree murder the next day.)  Some are being released from prisons. In New York, Michigan and California, thousands of prison inmates have been released in response to the coronavirus. The Facebook claim goes too far in characterizing them all as posing a threat to kill. In New York, Cuomo announced in April that pregnant women with less than six months remaining on their sentences for nonviolent offenses would be released from prison. The state announced in March that up to 1,100 inmates being held in local jails for low-level parole violations and deemed not a danger to the public would be released to stem the flow of coronavirus cases in the correctional system.  Michigan is releasing 200 prison inmates per week because of the coronavirus, WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Mich., reported on April 14. The state is looking to first release inmates eligible for parole who are nonviolent offenders older than 60 with health issues, though no offenses are off-limits, the report said.  California announced in March that it planned to release as many as 3,500 prison inmates by expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with 60 days or less left on their sentences. Correctional and detention facilities pose ""unique challenges"" in combating COVID-19, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.  Inmates live, work and eat in close settings, heightening the potential for the virus to spread. The virus can be brought into the facility in many ways, including through staff, medical professionals or others who enter from the outside. And options for isolating inmates are limited, the CDC notes. Across the country, more than 25,000 prison inmates have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 370 of them have died, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that reports on criminal justice. Staff and inmates are required to wear masks amid large outbreaks: New York: More than 1,200 prison staff have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the state. The Department of Corrections requires all staff to wear face masks while on duty and supplies all inmates with surgical-type masks. Michigan: There are more than 2,100 COVID-19 infections among prisoners and Michigan ranks third for the number of prisoner cases, according to the Marshall Project. Each prison employee and inmate has received three masks that can be laundered and worn again, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections. Staff are expected to wear a mask during their entire shift, and prisoners are expected to wear masks except while eating, sleeping or showering. California: More than 430 cases of COVID-19, including five deaths, have been confirmed at the California Institution for Men in Chino, with tents being set up to provide more space and treatment for inmates, the Sacramento Bee reported. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says it provides masks and hand sanitizer to all staff and prisoners. While masks alone cannot stop the spread of the coronavirus, health officials agree that facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, help slow the spread of the virus, as we’ve reported.  The CDC recommends that nearly everyone wear a facial covering while out in public and in areas where social distancing isn’t possible. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snugly and are made of multiple layers. New research since the start of the coronavirus outbreak supports the use of masks. For correctional facilities, a May 15 CDC report recommends cloth facial coverings, along with physical distancing, movement restrictions and other measures.  ""Prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and consistent application of prevention measures are critical to protecting incarcerated and detained persons, correctional and detention facility staff members, and the communities to which they return,"" the report said. A Facebook post claimed that if masks prevent coronavirus, governors in New York, Michigan and California would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them. Experts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus. New York, Michigan and California prisons are providing masks to inmates, as well as staff, as part of their COVID-19 response.  Inmates in those states are being freed early as a way to try to limit the spread of COVID-19 — mostly nonviolent offenders or those who aren’t seen as a safety threat. We rate the statement False. Correction, June 8, 2020: Michigan had more than 2,100 state prisoners with COVID-19, not more than 2,100 state prisoner COVID-19 deaths.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DEDD80>],/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/states-do-use-masks-contain-covid-19-prisons/

No, Fauci wasn’t on the Clinton Foundation board for two decades
","Anthony Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He wasn’t on Microsoft’s board of directors — a claim we recently debunked. But more misinformation abounds, and one Facebook post pads his resume with some new positions. ""Whoa!"" the May 12 Facebook post says. ""Dr Fauci was on Clinton Foundation Board for 20 yrs? Currently serves on Gates Foundation? #InvestigateFauci"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Brian Cookstra, a spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation, told PolitiFact that Fauci has never served on the board in any capacity. He’s not listed among the current board members, which you can see here, nor did we find any credible news stories or sources online that identify him as a former board member.  Fauci also is not listed among the leadership team members on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation website, including the executive leadership team headed by Bill and Melinda Gates and the global health division. He also isn’t listed on the Scientific Advisory Committee. From 2003-10 Fauci, among 21 other scientists, served on a Gates Foundation scientific board to ""guide and direct"" a new initiative to ""identify critical scientific challenges in global health and increase research on diseases that cause millions of deaths in the developing world."" The Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative was aimed at AIDS, malaria and other diseases, and Gates announced at the time that it would be administered by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, which agreed to provide scientific advice and support. The board that Fauci belonged to was formed to determine what ""grand challenges"" in global health could help thwart disease if they were solved. The initiative then provided grants to scientists around the world to look for solutions to the challenges.   But we found nothing to support what the Facebook post alleges.  We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D43C0>],/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/no-fauci-wasnt-clinton-foundation-board-two-decade/

Bill Gates did not say a COVID-19 vaccine could kill nearly 1 million people
","The conspiracy section of a conservative website carried an article with this headline: ""Watch: Bill Gates Admits His COVID-19 Vaccine Might Kill Nearly 1,000,000 People."" The article from CloverChronicle.com, shared widely on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the interview, Gates spoke theoretically about how many people might experience side effects from a yet-to-be-developed coronavirus vaccine.  He did not say anything about people dying from such a vaccine. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential novel coronavirus vaccines. There is no evidence that the foundation stands to profit from these efforts.  Readers of the article were instructed to go to minute 2:35 of a video that’s embedded in the article. The video is a 4-minute clip of an interview Gates did April 9 on CNBC about the work his foundation is doing to fight COVID-19. CNBC posted the clip on YouTube. It has been viewed more than 74,000 times. Gates mentions needing about 7 billion doses worldwide and says: ""The efficacy in vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people; most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly. ""Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more — 700,000 people who will suffer from that.  ""So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges — pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities — it’s very, very hard. And that actual decision of, OK, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world — governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on."" Gates makes no mention of anyone dying from the vaccine. He’s referring to side effects and suggests, theoretically, that if 7 billion vaccines are administered and one in 10,000 people experience side effects, that would mean 700,000 people experiencing side effects. (The full 26-minute interview is here.)
