Again, Trump boasted that he called to take out Osama bin Laden in 2000. He didn’t
","After President Donald Trump announced that terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dead, Trump repeated an inaccurate boast that he called for taking out Osama bin Laden before the Sept. 11 attacks. Trump said that he made the warning in his January 2000 book ""The America We Deserve."" Speaking to reporters Oct. 27, Trump said that he doesn’t get credit for warning that bin Laden should have been taken out. ""You know, if you read my book — there was a book just before the World Trade Center came down. And I don’t get any credit for this, but that’s okay. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book — a, really, very successful book. And in that book, about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, ‘There is somebody named Osama bin Laden. You better kill him or take him out.’ Something to that effect. ‘He’s big trouble.’"" Trump continued, saying that he said to people, ""Take out Osama bin Laden,"" although ""nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until, really, the World Trade Center. ""But about a year — you’ll have to check — a year, year and a half before the World Trade Center came down, the book came out. I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, ‘You have to kill him. You have to take him out.’ Nobody listened to me."" Trump made a similar statement in a speech as a presidential candidate in Virginia in 2015. We rated that statement Mostly False. At other speeches in 2015, Trump went further and said he ""predicted"" bin Laden and terrorism. Trump did write about bin Laden critically in his book, but he did not suggest that he be taken out. Bin Laden is mentioned once in the book, specifically in a passage criticizing President Bill Clinton’s approach to national security: ""Instead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flash points, stand offs, and hot spots. We’re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We’re playing tournament chess - one master against many rivals. One day we’re assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything’s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we’re told that a shadowy figure named Osama bin Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jet fighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later, it’s on to a new enemy and a new crisis."" (Emphasis in bold is ours.) Trump’s reference to bin Laden relates to the Aug. 20, 1998, U.S. bombing of his camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. Clinton said they were in retaliation for terrorist bombings earlier that month on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and wounding thousands. Clinton said the goal of the U.S. strikes was to ""disrupt bin Laden’s terror network."" Trump devoted a chapter to terrorism and warned broadly that America could be attacked, but he did not call for taking out bin Laden. He wrote that the U.S. ""must prepare for the real possibility that somewhere, sometime, a weapon of mass destruction will be carried into a major American city and detonated.""  Trump acknowledged that this was not his original thought, noting that ABC-TV’s ""Nightline"" had aired a series of shows about the threat.  In his comments to the media Oct. 27, Trump also said that ""al-Baghdadi everybody hears because he’s built this monster for a long time. But nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until, really, the World Trade Center.""  The United States government was aware of bin Laden a few years before the Sept. 11 attacks. The CIA established a unit in 1996, Alec Station, to hunt bin Laden when he was calling for global jihad. The station was disbanded a decade later. Trump said that in his 2000 book ""I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, ‘You have to kill him. You have to take him out.’"" Trump inaccurately recounted what he wrote in his own book. The only kernel of truth here is that Trump did write about bin Laden in the context of criticizing President Clinton. Trump’s book warned about terrorism, as did others by 2000, but he did not write that bin Laden should be taken out. This statement rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/oct/28/donald-trump/again-trump-boasted-he-called-take-out-osama-bin-l/

Do red flag laws allow gun seizure without a judge’s OK?
","The partisan divide over gun control in Wisconsin is as stark as it has ever been. Frustrated by a lack of Republican action on the topic, Gov. Tony Evers has called a special session of the state Legislature. He wanted lawmakers to take up a so-called ""red flag"" law — which would allow judges to take guns away from people who are deemed to be a danger — and an expansion of gun background checks to include sales between private parties. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald promptly announced he would likely adjourn the session as soon as it began, refusing to even vote on the proposals. Meanwhile, the state Legislature’s other lead Republican — Assembly Speaker Robin Vos — has been making the media rounds to defend Republican inaction and condemn Evers’ proposals. That included a Facebook Live interview with WTJM-TV’s Charles Benson on Oct. 22, 2019. Their conversation turned to red flag laws, also referred to as emergency risk protection orders. Here’s part of that exchange: Vos — Red flags laws, it’s basically like saying we are going to take away your car because we think you could drive drunk. It’s crazy. Benson — But a judge has to decide that. Vos — No, they take away your weapon first, then you have to go and ask permission to get the weapon back. Vos later reiterated his description while criticizing how the Marquette University Law School poll summarized red flag laws as ""allowing the police to take guns away from people who have been found by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others."" In late August, the poll showed 81% of respondents in support. ""That’s not the way the red flag law works,"" said Vos, R-Rochester. ""They take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it."" Is Vos right that red flag laws allow guns to be seized before a judge gets involved? Let’s dig in. Red flag laws provide a mechanism to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others. The first such law was passed in Connecticut in 1990, but the second didn’t appear until Indiana’s in 2005. More states have adopted such laws in recent years in the wake of mass shootings by people who had exhibited earlier warning signs. At least 17 states and the District of Columbia now have a red flag law, including several passed in 2019, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. Every state allows law enforcement to seek the removal of guns, 12  allow family or household members to as well, and a smattering of states also allow petitions from medical professionals, co-workers or school officials. Typically, a judge (or other judicial official such as a court commissioner) hears the request and then decides whether to issue a preliminary order without holding a hearing or notifying the gun owner. These orders are temporary and last from two to 21 days depending on the state, according to an issue brief put together by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. The gun owner then has a chance to make his or her case at a hearing before a judge decides on a final order. That order commonly lasts for a year. Different states have different burdens of proof that must be met for a judge to issue an order, such as finding the individual poses a ""significant risk"" or that there is ""clear and convincing evidence."" If an order is issued, some states require guns be turned over immediately, while others allow a short period of time. A search warrant authorizing seizure can also be issued in some states. Evers’ proposed red flag law for Wisconsin requires a hearing within 14 days of the preliminary order, and makes a final order valid for a year. It says guns should be seized if the judge finds ""reasonable grounds that the respondent is substantially likely"" to harm themselves or others. Requests can be made to either extend the final order or end it early. State law already requires guns be surrendered as a result of other judicial findings, such as mental health commitments and restraining orders, according to the Legislative Council. You may have noticed the word ""judge"" appeared frequently in the summary above. The Wisconsin proposal — contrary to Vos’ description — doesn’t allow any guns to be seized without a judicial order. Asked for evidence that judges aren’t initially involved in red flag law seizures, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer said Vos misheard the question. ""Speaker Vos thought Charles Benson had asked if the accused goes before a judge prior to an order to surrender,"" Beyer said. But that explanation doesn’t strike us as reasonable. Benson’s initial question about the red flag law was far less specific – asking if Vos thinks Wisconsin residents want to see it passed. And Vos’ second reference to a lack of judicial sign-off came after Benson simply read the wording of the Marquette poll. Descriptions of red flag laws consistently refer to decisions being made by judges. That’s the terminology used by Giffords, the Legislative Council, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the New York Times and many others. But there is an exception. Indiana’s law allows police to seize firearms without first obtaining a judicial order. However, they must then submit a statement to a judge, who can overturn the officer’s decision and refuse to issue a preliminary order, according to Giffords. Similar to other states, that preliminary order requires a hearing on a final order be held within 14 days. Beyer said Vos’ primary concern with the red flag laws relates to due process, since the preliminary order can be issued without the individual having a chance to dispute it. That is a core objection from other conservatives and groups that oppose red flag laws as well, including the National Rifle Association. Red flag laws have been challenged in other states, but courts have upheld them as constitutional on both Second Amendment and due process grounds, the Legislative Council said. That includes a ruling upholding the Florida law in September 2019. Vos said red flag laws mean ""they take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it."" But red flag laws — including the one proposed in Wisconsin — don’t typically work like that. They involve police or family petitioning a judge, who must sign a preliminary order before any guns can be seized. Indiana does have a law set up as Vos describes, but even there the seizure decision by police is subject to immediate judicial review. And that’s the exception, not the rule. We rate Vos’ claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/oct/28/robin-vos/do-red-flag-laws-allow-gun-seizure-without-judges-/

Durbin mostly on track with claim on Illinois deportations
","At a Senate hearing on a bill aimed at local governments that limit their cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin criticized the agency for not focusing its resources on immigrants who pose a threat to public safety. ""You’re not going after dangerous people, you’re going after people who are here undocumented,"" Durbin told the agency’s associate director of enforcement and removal operations. ""I can tell you the statistics in Illinois, where it turns out that fewer than 20% of those actually deported have been charged with any serious crime."" Is Durbin correct that less than a quarter of immigrants deported from Illinois have serious criminal charges in their background? When asked to provide support for the statement, a spokesperson for the senator pointed to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University, which maintains figures on the number of individuals who departed from a given state at the time of their deportation and provides the classification for their most serious criminal conviction, if any was listed by ICE. In the first 11 months of the 2018 fiscal year, 853 individuals were deported out of Illinois, 160 of whom were classified as having as having serious criminal convictions, according to TRAC’s data, which it obtains via public records requests from ICE. The agency classifies offense codes into three levels, the most serious of which covers what it considers ""aggravated felonies,"" a list of crimes laid out in federal immigration law that has expanded over the years and includes both violent and non-violent offenses. That amounts to less than 20% of total deportations from Illinois, as Durbin claimed. But the data has some limitations. While TRAC’s director, Susan Long, pointed us to the same dataset as Durbin, she added an important caveat. ""How ‘Illinois’ deportations are defined, as well as what is considered ‘charged with any serious crime’ will make a difference,"" she said. Other experts we contacted made a similar point: The location from which an individual departs the country is not necessarily where they resided prior to their arrest or even where they were arrested before deportation. Those are details ICE does not provide, according to Long. ""The removal dataset doesn’t tell you anything about the history of the person,"" said Guillermo Cantor, research director at the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit, who has also analyzed deportation data from ICE. ""You only know where the person was deported from … But that doesn’t have a lot of meaning in terms of analysis, because that person may have resided anywhere in the country."" Cantor and others also noted the data could represent arrests made several years ago, meaning it may not say much about the agency’s current policies under the Trump administration, which was the focus of Durbin’s criticism. ""Today’s deportees out of Illinois might have actually been arrested by ICE three years ago in some cases,"" said Randy Capps, a research director at the Migration Policy Institute. He pointed to TRAC data cataloging the backlog of pending deportation cases, which show that in 2018, cases in Illinois remained open for 963 days on average. The wait time has since fallen slightly. What’s more, the limited figures ICE provides to TRAC and others show the share of deportations involving convictions for what the agency deems serious crimes was relatively small during the Obama years as well — ranging from a 12.4% low for all deportations out of Illinois in 2009 to a high of 24.1% in 2015, after the Obama administration shifted its focus to individuals more likely to pose a threat to public safety. Capps said another set of federal data maintained by TRAC provides a more current picture of state-by-state enforcement trends under Trump. It shows ICE arrests of noncitizens with serious convictions in Illinois dropped from more than a third of the total in 2015 to a little over one-fifth in 2018. Meanwhile, the share of arrests involving individuals with no background of criminal convictions rose from 11% to 43%. Durbin said that in Illinois, less than 20% of immigrants who are deported ""have been charged with any serious crime."" Limited federal backs that up, but it comes with a few caveats — most notably the fact that the available count includes all individuals who departed from Illinois at the time of their deportation. That means they may have resided and been arrested in a state other than Illinois before leaving the country. We rate Durbin’s claim Mostly True.

No, British Parliament didn’t ban ‘witchcraft’ lipstick in 1770
","A curious ""fun fact"" about the 1770s, Britian and lipstick went viral on social media.  The Facebook post making the rounds claims that, in 1770, the British Parliament ""banned lipstick, saying it had the power to seduce men into marriage, which was classified as witchcraft."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Was the cosmetic really once banned under British law? We wanted to find out.  It’s accurate that during the 16th century (and beyond) people had very strong opinions about makeup and its ability to deceive the eye. One 1711 letter written to British newspaper The Spectator about the use of makeup said that men who had married women who didn’t ""let their husbands see their faces until they are married"" were ""injured gentlemen."" However maligned some men may have felt about the deception of painted lips, we could find no evidence that a lipstick ban ever made its way through Parliament at any time. A 2017 article by Racked, Vox’s now defunct fashion-focused website, dove into the rumors that a law passed in England in 1770, supposedly called the ""Hoops and Heels Act,"" that made it legal for a man to divorce his wife if she had tricked him into marriage using ""witchcraft"" to enhance her looks. The story says: ""Called the Hoops and Heels Act, it stated that any woman who tried to ‘seduce and betray into matrimony’ a man using ‘scents, paints, cosmetic washes, artificial teeth, false hair, Spanish wool, iron stays, hoops, high-heeled shoes, [or] bolstered hips’ would be tried for witchcraft and have her marriage voided if found guilty. ""Except it never happened. But generations of researchers have been fooled, some stating that the law was passed in 1774, others saying that it was voted down by Parliament, and another group claiming that under the counsel of their mistresses and wives, members of Parliament decided not to vote on it at all."" So despite iterations of the claim proliferating the internet for years, there was no British law that instituted a lipstick ban. Fact-checking website Africa Check found that the closest thing to such a law came in a June 7, 1650, entry in the House of Commons Journal under the heading ""Immodest Dress.""  That entry says: ""An Act against the Vice of Painting, and wearing black Patches, and immodest Dresses of Women, be read on Friday Morning next."" But officials with the United Kingdom’s National Archives told PolitiFact in an email that the bill never had a full reading, as far as they could see, and because of that ""it was likely introduced at the behest of a Puritan MP (member of parliament) but the Council of State chose not to pursue it."" While 1770s society may have considered painted lips and makeup in general to be unladylike witchcraft, a law banning it never succeeded. Feminine trickery marches on.

We read the columns about aging on the site and she doesn’t dole out the advice in the posts there or share its sentiments in different words. In a chapter about aging in her 1961 book, ""Since You Asked Me,"" Landers writes: ""Many who write are panic-stricken at the thought of leaving their 20s behind. More are terrified at the prospect of the Big 40. … For many, the fortieth birthday is a traumatic experience."" She also says that ""age is important only to the very young and to the very insecure"" and she criticizes beauty products marketed to help women stay young while also encouraging her female readers to stay thin and go easy on the makeup after age 45 because ""a heavy foundation base and too much powder or rouge accentuates the wrinkles.""

General Motors profits have been record-setting, but not in recent years
","The United Auto Workers union and General Motors are voting to finalize a tentative agreement to end the month-long strike of almost 50,000 hourly workers. The vote is set to end Friday. Union workers’ demands have centered around health care benefits, better wages and job protection. Some of the deal’s terms for hourly workers include a 3% wage increase in an employee’s second and fourth year with the company, a $60,000 bonus for 2,000 eligible production and 60 skilled workers who are set to retire, and protections on vacation time. Part of the argument made by UAW Local 2250 President Glenn Kage was that the union has helped GM remain financially stable over the course of the past decade. Local 2250 is the UAW chapter for the Wentzville, Missouri GM plant that manufactures full-sized vans. ""General Motors is making record profits,"" Kage said in a Sept. 16 interview with the Missouri Times, ""and they can’t do so without the hard work of our members who have earned pay increases, earned better benefits, earned for our temporary workers to be converted to permanent workers, earned job protections."" Whether GM is making record profits depends on the time period. ""My first question would be: for when? Because profits, as an accounting concept, is measured over a period of time, like a quarter or a year. So when someone just says record profits, they're leaving something (out),"" said Tim Howald, an adjunct accountancy and finance professor at the University of Missouri. In 2014, GM's quarterly profits were moving in a steady upward direction, eventually leading into a record year in 2015. According to GM’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, GM’s income was $9.7 billion for 2015, up from $2.8 billion in 2014. The increase leveled off in 2016, when income was $9.4 billion. The increased profits in 2015 can be attributed, in part, to the increased demand for high-margin pickup trucks and utility vehicles. The so-called Detroit Big Three manufacturers — GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler — specialize in these vehicles. They are popular at a time when ""we’re selling the most expensive vehicles we ever have,"" said Bernard Swiecki, director of the Automotive Communities Partnership at the Center for Automotive Research. ""Then within that is the move towards trucks and also crossover vehicles, which are cars that look like trucks,"" he said. ""Essentially because they are more profitable than sedans, that's driving higher profits for all automakers, but for the Detroit three in particular, because they dominate pickup trucks."" Part of what drove the profit increase also led to the strike. ""GM had about a million units of unused sedan capacity,"" Swiecki said. ""That brings us right back around to why they're making money — the market moved to trucks and that's good, in a way, because you get a more profitable GM. But (it’s) bad if you happen to be a GM manufacturing employee who’s in a sedan plant."" Comparatively, in 2017, the company lost $3.9 billion. This was due, in part, to adjustments to new tax laws. GM recovered in 2018 with a net income of $7.9 billion, but that wasn’t record-setting. Kage said, ""General Motors is making record profits."" According to GM’s SEC filings, GM had record profits in 2015, but not in the past two years, when GM’s profits have actually been decreasing. Although the recent years’ profits are higher than they were in the early to mid 2010s, they still aren’t considered record-setting.

No, there aren’t 14,000 abandoned wind turbines littered across the United States
","Missouri recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, north of Columbia. In April, President Donald Trump made the ""pants on fire"" claim that windmills cause cancer. Locally, renewable energy companies that fund wind energy projects in Missouri have recently made headlines for planning a new wind project in Boone County, just south of Harrisburg. Now, a widely-circulated chain email has resurfaced a claim industry experts have seen all too often: ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States."" This isn’t true. Wind energy proponents have been trying to dispel the claim for years, and 14,000 seems to be a fabricated number. The trouble is no one can say exactly how many ""abandoned"" wind turbines there are. Much of the email chain’s content appears to have been copied from an article on a blog site called American Elephants, which describes itself as a home of conservatives. The anonymous blog post was published July 7, 2013, meaning this claim is at least six years old. Wind energy experts have been trying to debunk this claim as a myth for just as long. ""It’s bullshit,"" said Paul Gipe, who has published five books on wind energy since 1995 and who has closely studied California’s wind farms. (Now the American Wind Energy Association does that.) Gipe said there have never been 14,000 abandoned wind turbines in California, in the United States, in North America or anywhere in the world. But at one time, there were approximately 14,000 wind turbines in California, total. He says he is ""the author of that number"" and believes that it is the origin of the 14,000 figure used in the email chain. Experts from the wind energy association agree that the claim is blatantly false, but the organization has struggled to correct the misconception. ""We know for a fact that it’s not true,"" said Kaitlin Monaghan, the association’s deputy director of permitting and asset management policy. ""We’re not sure why it’s been so hard for us to myth-bust it or why it’s kind of still floating around out there, but I think sometimes that’s how it goes."" James Owen, executive director of Renew Energy, a company that champions renewable energy , said he doesn’t know of any abandoned wind turbines in the state of Missouri. He, too, agreed that there is no evidence for the abandoned turbines claim. ""To the extent I’ve seen, there’s absolutely no basis for that,"" Owen said. ""It just seems like a number that was made up."" Monaghan acknowledged that wind turbines age and typically have a useful life of 20 to 30 years. At that time, she said old equipment must be taken down, repaired or replaced. If a project owner chooses to close a wind farm completely, Monaghan explained, it is the responsibility of the owner to decommission the farm, which includes removing wind turbines and restoring the land to its original state. She said there are often local and state laws that require this of individuals operating wind farms. However, 99% of wind projects are built on private land, so lease contracts for land used for turbines often include requirements for project owners to remove turbines and restore land when a project is shut down, Monaghan said. With this in mind, Monaghan explained that there are a number of reasons why project owners would not simply ""abandon"" wind turbines — meaning leave turbines standing despite not being functional. In areas where constructing wind farms requires permits, a project owner must often provide a detailed plan upfront for the eventual decommissioning of the project. Sometimes, owners will even have to provide a ""parent company guarantee,"" or some sort of financial backing, to reassure the community that no abandoned wind turbines will be left behind. On top of this, Monaghan said it would hurt companies’ reputations with landowners if they simply abandoned wind turbines. Turbines also have salvage value; the steel and other materials from a project could be repurposed or sold, Monaghan said. Finally, preexisting farms have already collected extensive wind speed data and have access to transmission lines. Greg Alvarez, deputy director of external communications for the wind energy association, explained that these features are valuable for projects and create ""very, very strong financial incentives to not let these sites sit vacant and abandoned."" As for those who believe companies are installing wind turbines to get a tax credit and then abandoning them, Owen said that was a ""patently absurd"" idea because companies only make money by selling power generated by the turbines. He said it was also a misunderstanding of the tax credit available. ""The tax credits they’re talking about are production tax credits,"" Owen said, ""so they don’t get the tax credit unless they’re producing something."" The U.S. Wind Turbine Database indicates that there are 60,576 turbines operating in the U.S., including Puerto Rico and Guam. In total, wind energy supplies just under 7% of the country’s electricity, according to Alvarez. He said the U.S. wind industry has 97,000 megawatts of installed capacity, which is enough to power about 30 million average American homes. Energy production is tracked and recorded, as is the installation of wind turbines, but no one is tracking the number of abandoned wind turbines. The wind energy association's experts said that at most, there is a small number of nonoperational wind turbines that may appear to be abandoned even if they are not. Beyond that, they couldn’t be more specific. Gipe’s best estimate of the actual number of abandoned U.S. wind turbines was somewhere ""in the hundreds"" but not the thousands. The email chain argues that ""14,000 abandoned wind turbines litter the United States."" There is not now, nor has there ever been, research to support the claim.

Bernie Sanders overstates recession aid to Wall Street banks
","Sen. Bernie Sanders marked his return to the campaign trail after a heart attack with a huge outdoor rally in New York City. Sanders stayed focused on his core message that corporate power drives government policy at the expense of hundreds of millions of Americans.  On student debt, Sanders said he would cancel every bit of it with money from a new tax on financial transactions. ""If Congress eleven years ago, against my vote, could bail out the crooks on Wall Street and provide them with trillions of dollars of zero interest loans,"" Sanders said Oct. 19. ""You know what? We can cancel all student debt in America with a modest tax on Wall Street speculation."" In this fact-check, we look at whether the federal government provided trillions of dollars of zero interest rate loans. Sanders is not fully accurate. Most of the loans –– and there were different types –– came at rates that were quite low, but above zero.  The total reaches $2 trillion, but not all of it went to the big players on Wall Street. In 2008, a financial house of cards built on junk home mortgages collapsed. With warnings that $5 trillion in U.S. assets could be wiped out virtually overnight, Washington moved to stem the crisis. The Federal Reserve was the biggest player, especially in terms of loans to the Wall Street banks. Congressional action was hefty, in the hundreds of billions, but much smaller compared to the Fed.  The Sanders campaign highlighted the work of the Fed, citing news reports of trillions of dollars in aid. ""One program alone doled out nearly $9 trillion,"" said the Christian Science Monitor.  But many of the loans involved banks rolling over short-term loans from one period to the next. Economics professor Todd Keister at Rutgers University said this produced a lot of double counting. He used the example of a home mortgage to explain what was going on. ""Suppose I borrow $100,000 to buy a house and then later refinance,"" Keister said. ""The refinancing involves paying off the original loan and taking a new loan for $100,000. If we add up the loans I took, we would say that I borrowed a total of $200,000. But there is a clear sense in which the amount I borrowed to buy the house was always $100,000."" The actual amount was about $1.4 trillion. That’s not trillions, as Sanders said, but it’s getting close. Federal Reserve data shows that interest rates were very low, but not at zero. ""Those interest rates were subsidized,"" said University of Louisiana finance professor Linus Wilson. ""Nevertheless, the interest rates were not zero."" Sanders took liberties in suggesting all the benefits went to Wall Street, though it’s fair to say the big banks did well. In some cases, outside the Fed, they got billions of dollars outright and through a number of federal actions, the biggest banks grew bigger. But many regional and community banks also benefited. About two-thirds of the loans in the largest program — the Term Auction Facility — came through Federal Reserve banks outside of New York. Among its other programs, the Fed was also buying bundles of home mortgages that the biggest banks had on their books. By June 2010, the Fed’s Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities program peaked at $1.1 trillion.  This was not a loan, but it helped the banks by moving the risks tied to those mortgage from the banks to the Fed. Not every expert would count it as aid to the banks, but if you do, it would bring the total aid to $2.5 trillion.  Outside of the Fed, Congress authorized direct government bailouts, in the form of the Troubled Assets Relief Program and the government takeover of the government-chartered home mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. According to a running tally by the nonprofit investigative journalism group ProPublica, the federal outlays were $633 billion. While Wall Street banks including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs pocketed $135 billion, the money went to many places other than Wall Street banks, such as General Motors. Adding all of it though to the Fed’s activities gives us two totals: either about $2 trillion if we don’t count the mortgage security purchases, or about $3.1 trillion if we do. Sanders said Congress gave Wall Street free money. The focus on Congress is a bit off, because while Wall Street did get billions, to get to trillions, the Fed dollars are essential. And the Fed operated on its own. ""Congress delegates responsibility to the Fed,"" said Rutgers economist Eugene White. Sanders said that during the Great Recession, Congress gave Wall Street ""trillions of dollars of zero interest loans."" By our calculations, the total across several actions ranged from $2 trillion to about $3.1 trillion. But Sanders is less accurate regarding where the money went and the interest rate. The biggest Wall Street players benefited greatly, but banks and other business across the country also got help. And while very low, the interest rates remained above zero. Also, the Fed is not Congress. Sanders oversimplified a complex response to an economic crisis.

What does Chick-fil-A have to do with Uganda’s anti-gay bill? Not much
","Some Facebook users are implicating Chick-fil-A in a Ugandan bill that would impose the death penalty for gay sex. ""Today Uganda announced a bill to legalize murdering gay people,"" reads one popular post, which was published Oct. 14. ""National Christian Organization paid a preacher to go to Uganda and help their lawmakers with the bill. Chick-fil-a (sic) funds National Christian Org."" ""If you eat at Chick-fil-a, this is what your money goes to."" The post, which is a screenshot of a tweet, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post refers to a bill in Uganda, where homosexuality is already illegal, that would punish gay sex with death. The bill was nullified five years ago on a technicality, but lawmakers have announced plans to revive it. In essence, the post is claiming that Chick-fil-A’s charitable contributions have been used to promote the death penalty for gay people in Uganda. Similar claims about the fried chicken chain and the Uganda bill have been shared thousands of times, so we wanted to check it out. Here’s what we found: • The nonprofit the Facebook post is referencing is the National Christian Foundation. • The preacher mentioned in the post did travel to Uganda around the time lawmakers were debating an anti-LGBTQ bill, but there’s no evidence he helped craft it. • The foundation run by Chick-fil-A’s owners has donated to the National Christian Foundation in the past, but it doesn’t currently. An American evangelical preacher supported by the National Christian Foundation did travel to Uganda in 2010, the same year the country was debating an anti-LGBTQ bill. But Colorado-based preacher Lou Engle didn’t ""help their lawmakers with the bill,"" as the Facebook post claims. Let’s focus first on what Engle did or didn’t do while in Uganda. Engle is the co-founder of TheCall Ministries, a defunct evangelical Christian group known for anti-LGBTQ views. It aimed to start ""a John the Baptist type movement to fast and pray in preparation for a 3rd great awakening."" In 2010, Engle traveled to Kampala, Uganda, to be the guest of honor at a Sunday prayer and rally about ""homosexuality, witchcraft, corruption and the fear of violence leading up to the country’s presidential election next year,"" the New York Times reported. Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni signs a new anti-gay bill that sets harsh penalties for homosexual sex, in Entebbe, Uganda Monday, Feb. 24, 2014. (AP) At the time, Ugandan lawmakers were debating a bill that broadened the criminalization of homosexuality and imposed the death penalty. A different version of the bill, which imposed life sentences instead of the death penalty, was signed into law in 2014, resulting in sanctions from the United States and other countries. A court annulled it later that year due to a legislative technicality. Engle was not directly linked to the legislation in Uganda, and he issued a statement ahead of his rally condemning the bill’s harsh penalties for homosexuality. However, during his rally in Kampala, Engle did praise the country’s ""courage"" and ""righteousness"" in pursuing the bill, the Times reported. The National Christian Foundation is a Georgia-based religious nonprofit and one of the largest charities in the United States. It was founded in 1982 by tax attorney Terry Parker, financial adviser Ron Blue and evangelical Christian author Larry Burkett. The National Christian Foundation gave TheCall $500 in 2009 and $300 in 2010, according to the group’s public tax documents. In 2008, TheCall received a much larger donation from the foundation — more than $160,000. It’s unclear to what extent those donations were explicitly for traveling to Uganda, if at all. TheCall announced it was closing sometime in 2018, according to the Wayback Machine. A 2012 investigation from the Atlantic found that, in 2008, the National Christian Foundation gave money to Ed Silvoso, a minister who founded a fundamentalist group called Harvest Evangelism, to work with a Ugandan bishop advocating for legislation imposing the death penalty for gay sex. Chick-fil-A did not support Uganda’s anti-gay bill, and connecting the company to it requires several steps. Most of the company and its owners’ charitable giving is conducted through two nonprofit foundations: the Chick-fil-A Foundation and the WinShape Foundation. The former was created by the company in 2012 and the latter was founded by the Cathy family 1984. Public tax records show the Chick-fil-A Foundation has not contributed money to the National Christian Foundation. However, the reverse is true — the National Christian Foundation gave the Chick-fil-A Foundation hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2014 and 2015. The WinShape Foundation’s tax records paint a different picture. We analyzed the foundation’s returns dating back to 2009, when the National Christian Foundation was donating to Engle’s TheCall. We found that WinShape’s contributions to the National Christian Foundation totaled $240,000 in 2009 and $247,500 in both 2010 and 2011. The National Christian Foundation has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to WinShape over the past decade. RELATED: Instagram post misconstrues food companies’ support for Donald Trump We asked Chick-fil-A and the WinShape Foundation why they passed money back and forth over the years. WinShape didn’t respond, and the company didn’t comment on the tax returns. ""The WinShape Foundation is a private family organization. The Chick-fil-A Foundation is the official philanthropic arm of Chick-fil-A, Inc.,"" the spokesperson said. ""Chick-fil-A has not supported legislative campaigns of any kind in Uganda."" The National Christian Foundation has a track record of donating to anti-LGBTQ groups, such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council. The former has supported sterilizing transgender people while the latter has defended the discredited practice of conversion therapy. In 2012, following comments from Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy opposing same-sex marriage, Chick-fil-A said it would ""leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena."" But 2017 tax documents from the company and its owners’ foundations show it still donates to organizations with negative views of homosexuality, including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Paul Anderson Youth Home. A Facebook post of a tweet claimed that Chick-fil-A has contributed to the National Christian Foundation, which then funded a preacher to travel to Uganda to help lawmakers craft an anti-gay bill. News reports show that the evangelical preacher Lou Engle did travel to Uganda in 2010, around the time that lawmakers were crafting a bill that would have imposed the death penalty for gay sex. However, Engle did not directly contribute to the legislation. While he complimented Ugandans for their stance against homosexuality, he denounced the harsh penalties proposed in the bill. Federal tax returns show that the National Christian Foundation contributed to Engle’s evangelical Christian group in 2009, before his trip. Documents also show that the WinShape Foundation, which is run by Chick-fil-A’s owners, donated to the National Christian Foundation in 2009, but the link between the company and Uganda’s anti-gay legislation is weak.

Donald Trump says impeachment is a coup. That's Pants on Fire
","Amid the pressure of a House impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump has continued to stoke the idea that he’s the victim of a coup — shorthand for ""coup d’etat,"" a French term that means the overthrow of the government. ""As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the........People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!"", Trump tweeted on Oct. 1.  The following day, Trump’s campaign unveiled a new ad that said, ""It’s nothing short of a coup, and it must be stopped."" On several subsequent occasions he’s shared his allies’ uses of the word on Twitter. He retweeted ""coup"" comments by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, on Oct. 3; former House speaker Newt Gingrich on Oct. 10; conservative broadcaster Mark Levin on Oct. 14; Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on Oct. 19; and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., on Oct. 24. Earlier in the year, Trump referred to the special counsel report headed by Robert Mueller as a coup. However, his use of the word ""coup"" to describe impeachment, a constitutionally defined process, is not accurate, even as a figure of speech. Let’s start with a more literal definition. The key element of a coup is that it is carried out beyond the bounds of legality. ""We define a coup d'état as the sudden and irregular (i.e., illegal or extra-legal) removal, or displacement, of the executive authority of an independent government,"" wrote the Coup D’etat Project at the University of Illinois’ Cline Center for Democracy in 2013. Violence is part of many coups, but being violent is not a necessary condition. Of the 12 types of coups recognized by the Cline Center, nine do not seem to have anything to do with what Trump is talking about, including military coups, rebel coups, popular revolts, dissident actions, palace coups, foreign coups, internationally mediated transitions, forced resignations, and self-coups, in which the leader strong-arms other branches of government to entrench power. Two other types are defined by how far they got — attempted coups (which try and fail) and coup conspiracies (which never get to the stage of being carried out). Any supposed coup against Trump would have been a coup attempt, since he’s still in office. But that doesn’t mean there actually was a coup attempt. Impeachment is explicitly described in the Constitution as the way to remove a president who has committed ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""  Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor, told us that you can’t get much more within the bounds of legality than an explicit power outlined in the Constitution. ""It’s obviously not a coup for the House to launch impeachment proceedings,"" Klarman told us in early October. The lead author of the Cline Center report, University of Illinois political scientist Peter F. Nardulli, called Trump’s usage ""ill-informed."" ""What is going on today in the United States is a constitutionally sanctioned process that is an integral part of the checks and balances that have been vital to the longevity and success of the U.S. Constitution and the Republic it created,"" he told PolitiFact. He added that ""there is nothing sudden or decisive about what is going on in the House of Representatives. It is conducting a deliberative, constitutionally sanctioned process. If an impeachment resolution is adopted, it will simply be forwarded to the Senate to conduct a trial."" Also, if Trump is removed from office, his duly elected vice president, Mike Pence, would take over -- not the opposition party. The Trump campaign defended the president’s comments by saying that dictionary definitions allow usages that are more informal than the ones used by academics such as the Cline Center. Merriam-Webster, for instance, says the word can mean ""a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics."" The Trump campaign pointed to widespread examples of Democratic lawmakers using ""coup"" to describe the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and to media reports using the word to characterize a 2009 change in leadership in the New York state legislature. Experts largely acknowledged that the word has more informal uses, and they retroactively admonished Democrats for using such language during Clinton’s impeachment. However, they said Trump is wrong — and ill-advised — to regularly encourage the use of the word ""coup"" to describe impeachment. While hyperbolic rhetoric is common in politics, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, ""what is unusual with Trump’s use of the term ‘coup’ is that it is the president who is using the term."" ""President Trump is taking the lead in intensifying the rhetorical battle, which is bound to make the divide between his supporters and other Americans even deeper than it would be if legislators and pundits were using the term,"" Smith said. Such an approach ""will justify more radical strategies in the future."" Nardulli of the University of Illinois added that ""there are good reasons that, like facts, people are not entitled to choose their own definitions of important things such as coups, especially when those definitions are self-serving."" In fact, Trump’s use of a word with such shock value is not an isolated incident, said Jack Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College. It needs to be understood as part of a larger strategy, he said. Trump has quoted pastor Robert Jeffress ""as saying impeachment would lead to ‘civil war,’ he has asked whether Adam Schiff should be arrested for treason, and he has suggested that the whistleblower was engaged in espionage against the U.S. government,"" Pitney said. ""This is all serious stuff for someone who gives orders to the military and the attorney general."" (We previously rated Trump’s use of ""treason"" Pants on Fire.) In addition to weakening constitutional directives at home, the use of ""coup"" sends a signal to anti-democratic forces overseas, said Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. ""At a time when the rule of law is under threat in both the United States and throughout the world, I think it is important to differentiate the legitimate impeachment process from illegal attempts to overthrow a government,"" Arend said. ""People may differ on whether they believe there is sufficient evidence to merit impeachment or removal from office, but the use of the impeachment process as established in the Constitution does not constitute a ‘coup.’' Trump has used the term ""coup"" to describe the impeachment process, and has approvingly retweeted allies who have used it. Trump’s campaign said the word can be applied more informally than as an extra-legal ouster of a government. However, Trump’s repeated use of the term alongside such other inflammatory charges such as ""treason"" suggests that he is using it intentionally to call into question the legitimacy of a constitutionally prescribed process. His statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2019/oct/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-impeachment-coup-s-pants-fire/

Matt Gaetz misleads about Obama's record on Ukraine military aid
","U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has become one of President Donald Trump’s key attack dogs as he pushes back against the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry through protests, regular Fox News appearances and on Twitter. As part of his defense of Trump, the second-term north Florida congressman has pointed the finger at former President Barack Obama’s actions related to Ukraine.  ""Barack Obama put a permanent stop on this military aid to the Ukraine - he never allowed it to go,"" Gaetz tweeted Oct. 21. ""You’re telling me Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for delivering aid that Obama didn’t deliver? That’s ludicrous."" Gaetz made similar remarks in a Fox News interview with Jeanine Pirro. In both instances, Gaetz oversimplified the facts and didn’t tell the full story.  The Obama administration refused to provide lethal weapons in 2014. The decision came as Russian forces invaded the eastern territory of Crimea in 2014 after Ukraine ousted its pro-Russia president. But the United States under Obama did provide extensive military and security aid but not lethal weapons. Further, Gaetz misrepresented the focus of the impeachment inquiry, which is about whether Trump temporarily withheld aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden.  When Gaetz said ""this aid,"" his spokesman said, Gaetz wasn’t talking about all military aid. He was referring to specific lethal military assistance that has been recounted in news reports in recent weeks. Gaetz’s office cited a recent column by conservative writer Marc Thiessen in the New York Post. The column mentions a sentence of reporting in a 2014 Wall Street Journal article about Obama rejecting ""weapons or lethal military aid to Ukraine.""  At the time, Obama officials were debating whether to send lethal military equipment amid the conflict with Russia, particularly Javelin anti-tank missiles. Obama rejected a request from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for lethal aid in 2014, though the White House approved a $53 million aid package that included vehicles, patrol boats, body armor and night-vision goggles, as well as humanitarian assistance. U.S. officials were concerned that providing the Javelins to Ukraine would escalate their conflict with Russia. Key allies, including Germany, were not keen on sending weapons into the conflict zone, said Michael Kofman, an expert on Russia and senior research scientist at the CNA Corporation. Between 2014 and 2016, the United States committed more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine. Under Obama, the federal government started the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which sent other kinds of U.S. military equipment to the country. From 2016 to 2019, Congress appropriated $850 million. In the last year of the Obama administration, Congress authorized lethal aid, but it didn’t include the Javelins. The 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which became law in November 2015, called for ""lethal assistance such as anti-armor weapon systems, mortars, crew-served weapons and ammunition, grenade launchers and ammunition, and small arms and ammunition."" The legislation also called for counter-artillery radars, unmanned aerial tactical surveillance systems and other equipment. But experts told us that the equipment ultimately provided during Obama’s tenure was non-lethal aid. ""The first lethal deliveries came from Trump,"" said Jim Townsend, deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO Policy during the Obama administration.  Trump, in his meeting Sept. 30 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York, would later downplay the money Obama gave calling it ""pillows and sheets."" (Former president Poroshenko had used similar language in 2014, telling Congress, ""Blankets and night vision goggles are important, but one cannot win a war with a blanket."") ""It’s not as if the White House was putting together these lists from political science majors sitting behind desks,"" Townsend said. ""They were recommended by European command and others who went in to see what they needed."" In July 2016, the White House announced a $335 million security assistance package for Ukraine that included ""counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, secure communications, training aids, logistics infrastructure and IT systems, tactical UAVs, and medical equipment."" In 2017, the Trump administration said it would sell lethal aid to Ukraine, and in 2018 it approved a plan to sell Ukraine $47 million in lethal Javelin Missiles. Even though the Trump administration has allowed the weapons, they are far from the frontlines. Congress approved another $250 million in military assistance in 2018, which Trump temporarily withheld along with $141 million in State Department aid in July. RELATED: The U.S. aid to Ukraine that Donald Trump froze, in one chart A Pentagon spokesman confirmed that the United States has provided $1.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014. To set the record straight, Democrats didn’t launch an impeachment inquiry because Trump delivered the lethal aid.  Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his presidential power by withholding the aid while asking its government to look into Biden, his potential 2020 opponent. They have not yet formulated articles of impeachment.  Gaetz said, ""Barack Obama put a permanent stop on this military aid to the Ukraine - he never allowed it to go."" Obama did not permanently stop military aid to Ukraine. The element of truth in Gaetz's statement is the Obama administration did not provide lethal military aid that Ukraine asked for in 2014. However, it did provide other military equipment and training. The United States has provided $1.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, on average $300 million a year.  This statement rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/oct/25/matt-gaetz/matt-gaetz-says-obama-permanently-stopped-military/

Bernie Sanders on target saying 3 richest have as much wealth as bottom half of all Americans
","In an opinion article he wrote for the Wall Street Journal, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called for an end to ""corporate socialism"" and made a claim about wealth inequality. ""The wealthiest three families now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country, and they will do everything they can to block our agenda,"" wrote Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president. The latest-available data back up his statement, and it appears the gap is widening. A note about wealth, before we dig in: Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home. But they also have debt, typically from a mortgage, credit cards or other bills. The result is that even some people with relatively healthy incomes, as well as many poorer people, have a negative net worth  — the more technical term for wealth. Sanders’ campaign told us his claim is based on a 2017 study from the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies. It used Forbes’ list of the 400 richest Americans and data from a gold-standard federal government source on wealth. Those are 2016 figures, from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances, which are updated every three years. The study found that the three wealthiest individuals were Bill Gates of Microsoft with $89 billion, Jeff Bezos of Amazon with $81.5 billion and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway with $78 billion. Their total wealth of $248.5 billion was higher than the wealth of the bottom 160 million Americans, at $245 billion.  Despite Sanders’ suggestion that the three men would block his agenda, they have expressed centrist political views over the years, and Buffett was a well-known supporter of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Whatever their views, Sanders is correct about their wealth, which is on the rise.  Forbes’ latest annual rankings for 2018 show Bezos, Gates and Buffett still ranked at Nos. 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and that their total wealth was $345 billion.  New federal figures for the bottom 160 million Americans aren’t expected to be released until sometime later in 2019. For the 160 million people at the bottom of the scale, the study used the net worth figure reported by the Fed and then subtracted automobiles and other ""durable goods"" such as electronics, furniture, and household appliances, from that figure. Subtracting durable goods from net worth ""offers us a more accurate depiction of household wealth as these items are not easily sellable and neither appreciate nor hold constant their value,"" the study said. University of Michigan sociology professor Fabian Pfeffer, whose research specialties include wealth inequality, was among a number of economists and wealth inequality experts who told us the federal figures used in the study are the best for assessing wealth in the population. He told us that the wealth gap is much greater in the United States than in other Western industrialized nations.  Pfeffer said the top 5% hold more than 70% of all net worth in the United States. That’s compared to 44% in Austria and Sweden, and lower figures in other comparable nations.  Sanders said, ""The wealthiest three families now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country."" The latest available figures indicate that the total wealth of Gates, Bezos and Buffett was $248.5 billion, exceeding the total wealth of $245 billion of the bottom half of Americans.

Was Kamala Harris ‘part of second class to integrate’ Berkeley's public schools?
","California Sen. Kamala Harris won a breakout moment in last week’s Democratic presidential debate when she attacked Joe Biden’s record opposing busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s.  But her critique of the former vice president also placed a spotlight on her claim that she was ""part of the second class to integrate her public schools"" through a busing program in Berkeley.  Some on social media have questioned her claim’s accuracy. Harris, 54, repeated her statement twice during her exchange with Biden, right after pointing out that he opposed busing.  ""There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me."" ""I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California, public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.""  Harris referred to the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.   Given the attention on this topic, we wanted to know whether Harris’ ""second class to integrate"" claim was biographical fact or fiction.  Our research  To examine Harris’ statement, we spoke with officials from Berkeley Unified School District, a historian who studied the city’s busing integration program, reviewed news articles and Harris’ biography. Here’s what we found:  Harris was born in Oakland on Oct. 20, 1964. She grew up in a black middle-class neighborhood in west Berkeley. Harris was three years old when Berkeley Unified’s school board voted in January 1968 to desegregate the district’s elementary schools, starting that fall, through a unique two-way busing program.  Children from the city’s more diverse western neighborhoods were bused to elementary schools in Berkeley’s eastern hills, a more affluent and whiter area. Meanwhile, children from the hills were bused to schools in the more diverse neighborhoods. Kamala Harris (left) in 1970 with her sister, Maya Harris, and mother, Shyamala Gopalan. Kamala Harris was part of one of the first classes to integrate Berkeley, Calif., elementary schools through a pioneering busing program that started in 1968. (Courtesy of Kamala Harris)  Natasha Beery, director of community relations at Berkeley Unified School District, told us Harris’ claim was ""absolutely"" accurate. She said Harris attended Thousand Oaks Elementary school, on the city’s northeast side. ""She would be part of that second class that integrated our schools through our two-way busing program,"" Beery added. ""It began in 1968. And she joined a group that had started kindergarten the following year in 1969 and so her description is correct.""  A spokesman for the senator’s campaign told us Harris joined the second class to integrate in first grade in 1970. She had attended a private school for kindergarten the year before. Altogether, that’s about 16 years after the Brown v. Board decision, which loosely fits with Harris’ statement of ""almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education."" After the debate, Berkeley Unified published a statement on its website explaining the history of its integration program and Harris’ experience.   ‘The two girls took the bus up the hill’ Carole Porter, a former neighbor and elementary school classmate of Harris, corroborated the senator’s statement in a recent New York Times article.  ""The two girls took the bus up the hill from the middle-class Berkeley flats where they lived to Thousand Oaks, a school in the white, more affluent Berkeley hills,"" the article said. ""Ms. Porter recalled that the ride took about 40 minutes. Ms. Harris attended a Montessori school for kindergarten and joined Ms. Porter at Thousand Oaks in first grade.""

Kamala Harris, who attended the school. The others (from left to right) include Ruth Asawa, Dolores Huerta, Malala Yousafzai, Serena Williams and Anne Frank. (Courtesy Sen. Harris's Twitter page) Questions about Harris’ claim surfaced, in part, after Gateway Pundit published a misleading article. The conservative website alleged the senator fabricated her story, citing Berkeley High School yearbook photos that show diverse classes before Harris was born.  But school district officials, and a city historian, say that allegation ignores a key fact: ""Berkeley has only one high school, so it was always integrated or at least desegregated,"" said Charles Wollenberg, author of ""Berkeley: A City in History.""  Integration at the city’s junior high schools started in 1964, Wollenberg said. It took place without busing, ""as ‘Busing’ was still an unwelcome word in Berkeley,"" at the time, according to a report the school district published last year marking the 50th anniversary of the busing system.  ""The bottom line,"" Wollenberg added, ""is that she was telling a simplified but basically accurate version of the truth."" We asked for Harris’ position on using busing to integrate schools today. Her spokesman said: ""Senator Harris supports federal measures to increase school diversity, including resources for busing,"" such as the Strength in Diversity Act proposed by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-CT, and Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-OH.  It would authorize $120 million in grants for ""voluntary community-driven strategies to increase diversity in schools,"" including expanding busing.  Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris claimed she was ""part of the second class to integrate her public schools"" and was bused to school in Berkeley, Calif.  We found Harris was bused to school, and joined the second class of a pioneering elementary school integration program in Berkeley. She was a first grader when she joined in 1970. Her statement could have used the clarification that the city’s junior high schools had already integrated several years earlier in 1964, though not through a busing program.   It’s also noteworthy that Berkeley’s high school was integrated years before Harris started school, but, again, not because of busing. Instead, the high school was racially diverse because it was the only comprehensive public high school in the city, drawing students from all backgrounds.  Even with these clarifications, Harris’ statement is generally correct, given the context of her exchange with Biden on busing. It was supported by her school district, a city historian and recent news articles. We rate her claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

CNN panelist misses the mark on GOP support of Medicare for All
","For two nights in Miami, candidates seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination for president tussled over the promise and feasibility of Medicare for All, the sweeping single-payer health care proposal made famous by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.  Discussion of the proposal did not stop at the debate stage. As the candidates took the topic to the cable networks over the weekend, so too did the pundits. In a June 30 roundtable on CNN’s ""State of the Union,"" conservative commentator David Urban said Democrats will risk losing to President Donald Trump in 2020 if they continue driving each other to the left.  Democratic strategist Jess McIntosh, the editor of Shareblue Media and former vice president of communications for Emily’s List, pushed back. ""I just think we have this erroneous idea that some of these policies that are being perceived or portrayed in the media as super lefty are actually enjoying really widespread (support),"" she said. ""Fifty percent of Republicans are in favor of Medicare for All."" Urban dismissed McIntosh’s claim, cutting her off and telling her amid the crosstalk to ""be very factual."" So, we checked the facts. As it turns out, Republican support for the type of Medicare for All bill that Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have put their names behind is not that high.  A greater share of Republicans have supported similar but more incremental approaches, which would add a government insurance option but would not eliminate all private coverage. The term ""Medicare for All"" most often refers to Sanders’ plan to create a single, national health-insurance program covering everyone in the United States. Its name makes it sound like an expansion of Medicare, but aside from being administered by the government, it would bear little resemblance to the health plan for people older than 65.  The Sanders plan proposes broad coverage that would replace most forms of private insurance, along with both Medicaid and Medicare. The government would set payment rates for services, drugs and medical equipment, and individuals would face no costs in the form of premiums, deductibles, copays or coinsurance. (For more on what Medicare for All is and is not, read our in-depth analysis of the proposal). Other Democrats vying for the party’s nomination have made the case for so-called ""public-option"" plans, which would make government-run insurance available while keeping private insurance intact for those who want it. These plans are often referred to as ""Medicare for America"" or  ""Medicare for All who want it.""  Some Democratic presidential hopefuls have also signaled support for these concepts as stepping stones to universal health coverage.   Medicare for All is a relatively new proposal, so Americans have not had much time to get familiar with it. Even still, several polls have sought to determine how the public feels. McIntosh said her numbers came from the June tracking poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking public opinion of the idea of a national health plan for years. According to that poll, 47% of randomly sampled Republicans said they were in favor of ""a national government administered health plan similar to Medicare that would be open to anyone, but would allow people to keep the coverage they have if they prefer."" That’s almost half of Republicans, but the plan described is closer to a public-option plan than the most commonly understood definition of Medicare for All, since both the Senate and House bills proposing Medicare for All would abolish virtually all private coverage. When the same pollsters asked about ""a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan,"" only 23% of Republicans were in favor of it — a far cry from 50%. McIntosh said she was not referring specifically to Sanders’ plan when she made her statement on CNN. She was talking instead about the Democratic field more generally — ""most of whom favor some kind of option like the one Kaiser polled,"" she said.  But language matters. The phrase ""Medicare for All"" might call to mind different things for different people, but it ultimately refers to proposals, like Sanders’, that do not leave open the option for people to retain their private insurance.  Because the proposal’s terminology is so ambiguous, its meaning can get lost and certain polling questions can be misleading. The same Kaiser poll also found that total support for Medicare for All dropped when pollsters said explicitly that the plan would get rid of private insurance. Other polls, which asked slightly less exact questions, returned different results. A 2018 Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked nearly 3,000 adults if they would support or oppose ""a policy of Medicare for All"" found about 52% of Republicans in favor.  A 2018 poll from the Hill asked, ""Would you support or oppose providing Medicare to every American?"" And 52% percent of Republicans said they would strongly or somewhat support it. Finally, a February CNN poll asked if ""the government should provide a national health insurance program for all Americans, even if this would require higher taxes?"" A total 54% of respondents said yes. But 54% also said such a program should not ""completely replace private health insurance,"" compared to 40% who said it should. McIntosh said ""50% of Republicans are in favor of Medicare for All."" According to the Kaiser poll McIntosh cited as evidence, 47% of Republicans are in favor of creating a government health insurance option to compete with private insurance plans. But that’s not what Medicare for All would do.  When asked specifically about ""a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare for All, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan,"" only 23% of Republicans said they supported it.

Cory Booker and drug maker campaign cash: By the numbers
","Both Republican and Democratic voters have little love for prescription drug makers. When asked, four out of five Americans say the cost of drugs is ""unreasonable."" Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has signed on to a bevy of plans to bring prices down.  ""There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers,"" Booker said at the first Democratic debate in Miami. The Trump campaign fired off a reminder that Booker has history with the drug makers. ""Cory Booker has accepted over $400,000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career,"" @TrumpWarRoom tweeted June 26, the night of the first Democratic debate. FACT: Cory Booker has accepted over $400,000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career. pic.twitter.com/1HUfFVBGVU By one measure, that number is correct. But a more granular look at drug maker political money delivers a lower number, and the tweet gives no hint that Booker stopped taking pharmaceutical money in 2017. The Trump campaign sent us to Booker’s career summary page on the Open Secrets website, a reliable source of federal political money data. Booker first ran for Senate in 2013. Since then, people and groups tied to the pharmaceutical/health products industry have given Booker $411,948. The number is actually higher. Booker runs a leadership PAC, a common device on Capitol Hill to raise money for a variety of uses, from travel expenses to helping other candidates fund their campaigns. Booker’s PAC got $56,000 since 2014, for a grand total of $468,000. There’s an important caveat: That industry group includes much more than drug makers. Drug wholesalers, medical equipment makers and dietary supplement companies all fall under this category. The wholesalers would have a stake in bills aimed at lowering prescription drug costs, but many other companies, such as Nestlé, which owns several dietary supplement brands, and Medtronic, maker of insulin pumps and much more, would go untouched by such legislation. Boiled down to drug makers alone, according to data pulled by the Open Secrets staff, Booker’s total is $327,000. That includes both donations to his campaign committee and his leadership PAC. One last wrinkle would add some money back in. The Trump campaign tweet was based solely on Booker’s federal receipts. But as mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, Booker raised millions. Some of that came from people tied to drug makers. A notable example is Jonathan Sackler, a member of the family behind Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. In 2009, Sackler gave $26,000 to Booker Team for Newark, a joint campaign committee to help elect Booker and a slate of city councilors. At the end of the day, we found that drug makers gave Booker’s campaigns upwards of $350,000. That’s less than the tweet claimed, but still a hefty amount. And if drug wholesalers are added in, the gap largely disappears. In June 2017, Booker told NPR he had stopped taking industry donations. ""We put a pause on even receiving contributions from pharma companies because it arouses so much criticism,"" Booker said.  Recently, he tweeted, ""Big pharma companies need to be held criminally liable for the opioid crisis. I’ve said I would not take contributions from corporate PACs, from pharma executives — they are part of this problem.""  Big pharma companies need to be held criminally liable for the opioid crisis. I’ve said I would not take contributions from corporate PACs, from pharma executives — they are part of this problem. It’s time to work on a solution. Chip in to help us run a people-powered campaign As far as his PAC money, that revenue stream has died for Booker. Up through 2016, drug makers had given him $202,000. Since then, as the chart below shows, the amount from drug makers directly is zero, with some ongoing donations from individuals who work for drug makers. New Jersey is home to many large pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Individuals who work for them have continued to give to Booker, but since 2016, that has fallen from nearly $100,000 to about $26,000. Booker’s campaign noted that he joined with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on a drug importation bill. Booker also put forward legislation that would allow the Medicare program to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. These and other measures have drawn strong opposition from the drug industry. The Trump campaign said that in the course of his career, Booker has accepted over $400,000 from the pharmaceutical industry. The number is close. What the tweet ignores is that Booker stopped taking money from pharmaceutical industry PACs and top executives. Since 2016, Booker received zero dollars from drug makers and individual contributions have fallen by 75%. The average reader of the tweet would have no idea that Booker has shunned pharmaceutical money for the past two years. That’s additional context, but Booker did accept the money in years past.

Trump’s claim Obama begged to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is unproven
","Before President Donald Trump became the first American president to stand on North Korean soil, he told reporters he and Kim Jong Un have a ""a certain chemistry"" that could lead to good things. Trump noted under President Barack Obama, face-to-face meetings never happened. ""Nobody was going to meet,"" Trump said. ""President Obama wanted to meet, and Chairman Kim would not meet him. The Obama administration was begging for a meeting. They were begging for meetings constantly. And Chairman Kim would not meet with him."" The statement that Obama and his administration ""were begging for a meeting"" is not backed up by the record. We reached out to the White House press office, and staff there had no comment. Obama’s special representative for North Korea policy, Glyn Davies, laid out the administration’s position for senators at a 2013 hearing. ""The United States will not engage in talks for the sake of talks,"" Davies said March 7, 2013. ""The United States will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. We will not reward the DPRK for the absence of bad behavior. We will not compensate the DPRK merely for returning to dialogue. We have also made clear that U.S.-DPRK relations cannot fundamentally improve without sustained improvement in inter-Korean relations and human rights. Nor will we tolerate North Korea provoking its neighbors. These positions will not change."" This policy came on the heels of discussions with North Korean negotiators in 2011 aimed at restarting more robust talks that had been on hold since 2008. Initially, Pyongyang indicated it was open to the return of international inspectors, and a moratorium on nuclear tests, long-range missile launches, and all nuclear activity, including uranium enrichment. In 2012, the process broke down when North Korea announced plans to launch a satellite, a move the Americans called a deal-breaker. US-North Korean expert Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation, said Obama was ""reticent to engage the top leader without having the pieces in place."" ""Obama never, to the best of my knowledge, asked, much less begged, for a meeting with Kim Jong Un,"" he said. ""In fact, he took a stand-off approach, which came to be known as strategic patience."" In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama spoke of the preconditions for talks. ""The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations,"" Obama said. Joseph DeThomas at the Penn State School of International Affairs said he is unaware that Obama ever sought to meet with Kim ""at all."" ""Certainly in the second term, the United States conditioned all talks in pretty strict terms,"" DeThomas said. The closest Obama came, said Kelsey Davenport with the Arms Control Association, was holding out talks as reward for strong promises of change from North Korea. ""The Obama administration remained open to talks with North Korea, but set onerous preconditions requiring Pyongyang to take steps toward denuclearization before beginning negotiations,"" Davenport said. David Albright with the Institute for Science and International Security echoed all of the above. ""I have never heard this,"" Albright said. In addition, the Obama administration imposed stiff economic sanctions on North Korea, including sanctions on Kim himself. Trump said the Obama administration was begging for a meeting with Kim. The public record shows the Obama administration rejected the idea of meetings of any sort until North Korea promised to back off of its nuclear program and accept international inspections. While the administration held out hope of North Korea meeting those preconditions during Obama’s first term, in the second, it took a harder line.

Beto O’Rourke’s warning about undercount with census citizenship question missing key details
","A citizenship question could find its way on the 2020 Census if lower federal courts find that the federal government offers sufficient justification for it, the U.S. Supreme Court said June 27. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke spoke out against the citizenship question in an interview June 13 on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. O’Rourke made a claim that caught our eye: that the U.S. Census Bureau has predicted an undercount of certain groups if the citizenship question gets included. ""The Census is predicting a 6% undercount that will be targeted against nonwhites in this country — so Hispanics, African Americans, communities of color,"" O’Rourke said. Is O’Rourke right about that? The Census Bureau estimated nearly a 6% decline in self-response rates from noncitizen households, if the question were added. In the context of O’Rourke’s claim, there are a couple of key distinctions to make: a decline in self-response is different from an undercount, and a noncitizen is a person who is not a U.S. citizen (this isn't limited to nonwhites). Separate studies, however, do predict undercounts of blacks, Hispanic/Latinos and noncitizens, and O’Rourke’s 6% statistic is in the ballpark. There’s always a risk of certain groups not being in the census, but a census with a citizenship question ""could feature an undercount more severe than usual,"" said Spencer Allen Shanholtz, research and policy analyst of the Demographics Research Group at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. The Census Bureau hasn’t studied whether adding the citizenship question will result in undercounting.  But the Census Bureau has estimated how much the question, if added, could affect self-response rates to the 2020 Census. O’Rourke conflated these points. To do this, the Census Bureau compared self-response rates on the 2010 American Community Survey, which had a citizenship question, to the response rates on the 2010 Census, which didn’t have the question. In a study published August 2018, the Census Bureau estimated a 5.8% decline in self-response rates for noncitizen households, if a question is included. A decline in self-response rates is not the same as undercounting. A household might not respond on its own to the census form, but it has another opportunity to be counted once a census enumerator goes door-to-door to gather the information. (There are two stages of counting the U.S. population: the first occurs when people self-respond their information, and the second stage only pertains to the people who did not fill out the census by themselves — census enumerators go door-to-door to those households.) The citizenship question may be a ""major barrier"" to full participation in communities that feel targeted and think that the question’s purpose is ""to find undocumented immigrants,"" said an October 2018 Census Bureau presentation on the results of surveys and focus group studies. While O’Rourke misrepresented the Census data, there are other studies on his point of potential undercounts of communities of color. Researchers at Harvard University, George Washington University, and the Urban Institute released estimates on potential undercounts in the 2020 Census, if the citizenship question is added.  The undercount estimates range from 4% to 12%, and among the groups studied were blacks, Hispanic/Latinos and noncitizens. Harvard Kennedy School researchers in a randomized controlled trial found that ""asking about citizenship would reduce the share of Hispanics recorded by the census by approximately 6.07 million, or around 12.03% of the 2010 Hispanic population.""  Christopher Warshaw, assistant professor of political science of George Washington University, conducted three distinct analyses to predict undercounting in the 2020 Census. He estimated the following approximate undercounts: 5.8% of noncitizens; 5.8% of noncitizens and Hispanics; 5.9% of Hispanics and 11.3% of foreign-born non-Latinos. The Urban Institute in a June 2019 study predicted a national undercount of 3.68% of blacks and 3.57% of people who identify as Hispanic or Latinos. And certain geographies and states are much more at risk than others, such as O’Rourke’s home state of Texas, the Urban Institute found.  O’Rourke also claimed that the Census predicted an undercount that would be ""targeted against nonwhites in this country — so Hispanics, African Americans, communities of color.""  Experts said O’Rourke conflated nonwhites with noncitizens. The Census Bureau study specifically estimated a decline in self-response rates for noncitizen households — which means at least one noncitizen resides within the home. A noncitizen is someone who has not been naturalized in the United States. Nonwhite includes black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. (Hispanic is an ethnicity, not a race.) To O’Rourke’s credit, a noncitizen household can also be a nonwhite household. The Department of Homeland Security in an annual report said that the share of noncitizens is dominated by people from Asia and Latin America. O’Rourke said, ""The Census is predicting a 6% undercount that will be targeted against nonwhites in this country — so Hispanics, African Americans, communities of color"" if a citizenship question is asked. The Census Bureau made estimates for noncitizen households — not nonwhites — and estimated a 6% decline in self-response rates, which isn’t the same as an undercount. These distinctions are important in the context of how the population is counted and who’s at risk of being left out. However, researchers do estimate that blacks, Hispanic/Latinos and noncitizens could be undercounted if a citizenship question is added. Those estimates range from approximately 4% to 12%. So there’s basis for O’Rourke’s 6% figure, even though he mentioned the wrong source. O’Rourke’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2019/jul/01/beto-orourke/orourkes-warning-about-undercount-census-question-/

Warren correct: Inmate phone calls can cost $25 for 15 minutes
","In her ongoing release of plans to tackle pocketbook issues, Elizabeth Warren proposed banning private prisons and detention centers. Particularly in the area of immigrant detention, Warren cast private companies as making huge profits at the expense of immigrants and taxpayers. The Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts senator also honed in on the firms that provide services to prisons and jails nationwide. Warren singled out phone companies that specialize in prisons and jails. ""The government has also stood silently by while private contractors providing services in both public and private centers come up with extortive schemes to make millions off of the backs of incarcerated people,"" Warren wrote June 21. ""Prison phone companies charge as much as $25 for a 15-minute call."" How pricey is that? We found one mobile phone plan that costs $9/month for unlimited calls and text. There are other deals out there that cost a little more, but details aside, for millions of Americans, talk is cheap. We wanted to see if $25 for one 15-minute call was a real thing. It is, although only in a few places. People in jails and prisons rely on the phone systems offered to call family, friends or a lawyer. The issue of high telephone prices for prisoners is decades old.  Warren’s staff pointed us to a broad report on companies that make their money from government spending tied to corrections and detention. For phone service, that report drew on the research of the Prison Policy Initiative, a research and advocacy group for prisoners and their families.  Each year, the Prison Policy Initiative checks the rates for over 2,000 jails and prisons.  The group’s data table for 2018 provides the cost of a 15-minute call. It ranges from a low of 30 cents in Travis County, Texas, to $24.82 at three small jails in Arkansas. The Arkansas facilities are: Mississippi County Detention Center (average inmate count of 158); Baxter County Sheriff’s Office (current inmate count of 120); and Arkansas County Jail (maximum capacity is 136). Not far behind are jails in Michigan ($22.56 for 15 minutes) and Wisconsin ($21.97 for 15 minutes). The group’s data shows 18 facilities charge $20 or more for a 15-minute call. Nearly 90 charge $15 or more. Securus Technologies provides phone service at the Arkansas jails with the highest prices (one is changing providers soon). We checked the company’s rates to see if their numbers matched the ones in the data table. In Arkansas, they did. The Michigan facilities were a few cents lower. The company said prison communications require security and monitoring technology that increases costs. And the jails and prisons make money off the contracts. ""Many jurisdictions incorporate commissions, which help fund additional services for incarcerated individuals such as addiction workshops and educational courses,"" said Securus Technologies vice president Joanna Acocella. ""In Mississippi County, Arkansas, for example, the commission rate is close to 65%.""  Securus Technologies serves many of the facilities on the Prison Policy Initiative list, but other companies also charge high rates. Warren’s number holds up, but it’s important to note that the median price across all facilities is $3.75 for a 15-minute call. The average is a bit higher at $5.82.  ""No question, these are outliers,"" said Prison Policy Initiative executive director Peter Wagner. ""But there are even more extreme examples where contracts allow special fees that push prices even higher."" Wagner emphasized that these charges are for in-state calls. As early as 2013, the Federal Communications Commission capped rates on calls across state lines, which reduced costs. The FCC casts the problem in the same light as Warren. Its website refers to ""excessive rates and egregious fees on phone calls."" In 2016, the agency voted to cap in-state rates. The commission’s two Republican members, then in the minority, opposed the move on the grounds that the agency was overreaching and had failed to consider the higher costs jails face. A court ruling put the change on hold. After the 2016 election, the FCC’s membership changed, and President Donald Trump named one the Republicans to chair the FCC. The agency announced that it would not move forward with caps on in-state rates. The Prison Policy Initiative report said many state prison systems on their own cut the cost of in-state calls. But charges remained high in many city and county jails. Warren wrote of prison phone companies, but the high price she mentioned is typically found in jails. Warren said that ""prison phone companies charge as much as $25 for a 15-minute call."" We found three jails in Arkansas where in-state calls cost about that much. Those are outliers, but thousands of inmates at more than 90 facilities pay high charges for a single call. The FCC’s webpage talks about ""excessive rates and egregious fees.""  Warren didn’t distinguish between prisons and jails, but for prisoners and their families, the fees they face are high. Warren’s words are largely accurate but more context helps round out the picture. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/jul/01/elizabeth-warren/warren-correct-inmate-phone-calls-cost-15-minutes/

Seeking reparations, Ta-Nehisi Coates says typical blacks have one-tenth the wealth of whites
","Author Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose 2014 essay is credited with restarting debate over reparations for slavery, testified at a hearing before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on June 19. Arguing that reparations is a matter of ""making amends and direct redress,"" Coates made a claim about wealth that we want to check, saying: ""The typical black family in this country has one-tenth the wealth of the typical white family."" What we found is that he is citing the most respected and most recent authority on the racial wealth gap. Reparations, if eventually enacted, would likely include a formal apology for America’s history of slavery, as well as some form of financial compensation to descendants of slaves. Wealth is often confused with income, and while the two often go hand in hand, they are different. Income is how much money a person makes from a job or investments. Wealth is the value of everything a person owns after factoring in debt. The equity in a home, retirement savings and bank accounts, for example, are part of a person’s wealth. We asked Coates’ publisher for more information on Coates’ remark, but did not hear back. PolitiFact Texas checked a similar claim from Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman now running for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president. O’Rourke said ""black Americans have 10 times less wealth than white Americans."" That rated Mostly True.  Coates’ claim is more precise in that he referred to the typical family. The claim is accurate when speaking about family median wealth. Economists told us median wealth data represents a typical family more than would data on average wealth. (The latter can be skewed by families with extreme wealth.) Median wealth is the halfway point  — half of families have wealth above the median, and half below. Wealth is measured as net worth  — the difference between a family’s gross assets and their liabilities. Here, with some additional details, are the figures cited by PolitiFact Texas: 2016 Family Median Net Worth  White: $171,000 Black: $17,600 Hispanic: $20,700 Other: $64,800 
The table shows that the median family net worth, or wealth, for black families was $17,600 in 2016, or roughly one-tenth that of the typical white family. Those 2016 figures, from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances, are the most recent available. Five experts told us that’s the most solid data source on wealth. The figures exclude some things that could be considered ""wealth,"" such as aid from government programs, said economist Ryan Bourne of the Cato Institute The survey, done every three years, collects information about various family finances, including income, net worth and credit use. ""No other study for the country collects comparable information,"" the agency says. It’s worth noting that the table also shows that black families closed the wealth gap with white families a bit between 2013 and 2016. But the report said ""the long-standing and substantial wealth disparities"" between families of different racial and ethnic groups ""have changed little in the past few years."" The report offered a couple of possible explanations for the gap: ""Well over half of white households are homeowners (73%), compared with just under half of black"" households. White households ""tend to be older, more highly educated, more likely to have received an inheritance and less likely to be a single parent."" A February 2019 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, however, drew a different picture. ""We find that the income gap is the primary driver behind the wealth gap and that it is large enough to explain the persistent difference in wealth accumulation."" Coates said, ""The typical black family in this country has one-tenth the wealth of the typical white family."" The best way to measure typical wealth is with the median net worth, and the most recent figures are for 2016. The median net worth  — gross assets minus liabilities — for black families was $17,600, about one-tenth the wealth of white families, which was $171,000.

No, voucher schools haven't raised property taxes by $1B since 2011
","Voucher schools are an ongoing point of contention in Wisconsin’s divided government, with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers even promising to tighten or end the decades-old program. The system, which uses taxpayer money to send low-income students to private schools, has been tweaked and debated but ultimately expanded under Republican control in recent years. In recent comments, one Democratic lawmaker claimed it has grown into a program with a 10-figure tax impact.  ""The only thing voucher schools have done for low-income kids is increase their parents’ property taxes. That’s it,"" said state Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, during a May 23, 2019, session of the Joint Committee on Finance, the Legislature’s budget-writing body.  She went on to say: ""They have failed to increase academic performance of low-income kids or graduation rates of low-income kids, but they’ve increased property taxes. You know how much by? Since 2011, and this is from the (Legislative) Fiscal Bureau — $1 billion."" We’ll leave the performance arguments for another day and focus on the price tag. Has the voucher program, also known as school choice, really raised property taxes by $1 billion? Though the voucher program is often referred to as a single entity, it is actually four different programs.  The Milwaukee Parental Choice Program is the first and largest, launched in 1990. The Racine Parental Choice Program started in 2011, the statewide Wisconsin Parental Choice Program in 2013 and the statewide Special Needs Scholarship Program in 2016. The programs allow parents to send their children to private schools with a taxpayer-funded voucher. Families must meet certain income limits (though those don’t apply for the special needs program) to qualify for vouchers and must reapply every year. The programs had a combined enrollment of about 40,000 students in 2018-19, with about 75% of those in Milwaukee. The state could fund the voucher program by simply paying the vouchers from the state’s general fund — the Racine and statewide programs used to work like this — but instead it is now done through a complex exchange of funds. The mechanics vary between programs, but generally it works like this: When a student enrolls in a voucher school, the state pays the amount of that voucher — roughly $8,000 per student  — to the school and reduces the state aid to the public school district where the student lives by the same amount. The state then increases the amount the district can levy in property taxes by the same amount to make up for the lost voucher funds. The system helps restore district funding levels since losing a smattering of students at different levels doesn’t typically result in lower costs for the district. That is, a district can’t get rid of a grade-level classroom or drop a teacher who teaches a particular subject just because two students in one grade and one in another move to a voucher school. The district isn’t required to raise taxes; it could make up the money by cutting elsewhere.  But since 2011, the period cited by Taylor, there was just one year where Racine or Milwaukee didn’t increase the property-tax levy to that maximum, according to the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Dan Rossmiller, government relations director for the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, also noted districts are motivated to levy to this maximum since this is a ""use it or lose it"" system. Districts that don’t tax to that full amount in a given year can’t return to that levy amount in the future. The state is in the process of changing this system for Milwaukee.  The state is reducing voucher funding from school aids (which are offset by tax levy increases) and replacing that with funding straight from the general fund. By 2024 the Milwaukee voucher program will be fully funded through the state general fund, with no property tax levy impact. Taylor spokesman Chet Agni told us the $1 billion figure is taken from a fiscal bureau memo prepared at Taylor’s request. The June 7, 2019, memo said the state’s voucher and independent charter schools resulted in a loss of school aid to public school districts of $1.09 billion from 2011 through the 2018-’19 school year. Since districts generally levied the maximum amount to make that up — aside from $167,000 the Racine school district didn’t levy in 2016-17 — the total levy increase is $1.07 billion. Before Taylor’s $1 billion comment, she referenced budgetary costs of both voucher schools and independent charter schools. Charter schools are public schools operating under an entirely different system from vouchers. But Taylor’s statement on property tax impact referred only to voucher schools. And that changes the math dramatically. With charters out of the equation, the tax levy from the four voucher school programs totaled $556 million since 2011. But there’s a lot more to this claim. Each district has a revenue limit that consists of state aid + local property taxes. Rossmiller, from the school boards group, said districts in the Racine and statewide programs can recoup some of the lost funding because students in voucher schools still count in the formula the state uses to calculate the aid provided to each district (though the formula uses the prior year enrollment).  Since the revenue limit doesn’t change, this additional aid typically reduces the amount a district levies. That, in turn, lessens the property tax burden. But in practice this doesn’t happen for all districts and won’t necessarily cover a large portion of the aid lost to vouchers. In addition, the claim that voucher schools led to tax increases implies none of that money would be spent if the voucher program didn’t exist. But that’s only true in an alternate reality where none of those students wind up in the public school system. In the 2018-'19 school year, 34% of students enrolling in the statewide voucher program for the first time came from public schools, according to the state Department of Public Instruction. Most of the rest came from private schools (46%), with the rest previously homeschooled or enrolling in school for the first time. Voucher supporters such as Jim Bender, president of School Choice Wisconsin, note that the state spends less to educate a voucher student than a public school student.  Public school students cost an average of $10,500 when you count state aid and local property taxes. Public funding for voucher students in 2018-19 was $7,754 per K-8 student and $8,400 for high schoolers. So a high school student coming from a public school to a voucher school could be seen as reducing the local property tax levy by $2,100, and one in a private school who is newly eligible for a voucher would be adding $8,400 to the levy. Taylor said voucher schools in Wisconsin have generated a $1 billion increase in property taxes since 2011. But getting to that level requires you to add in public charter schools, a completely different program. The actual property tax increase attributable to the voucher program is $556 million. Even that number oversimplifies the matter. It doesn’t factor in additional aid that makes up at least a portion of the lost voucher student revenue for some districts. And it implies all those property taxes would go away if the voucher program ceased to exist, which is only true in a scenario where none of the voucher students wound up in a public school.  So Taylor’s point that vouchers are connected to a tax increase is right, but her numbers are off by a ways and don’t account for many nuances in the system.  For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2019/jul/01/chris-taylor/Wisconsin-voucher-schools-property-taxes/

Chicago police union president's attack on consent decrees falls short
","Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot had a strained relationship with the city’s main police union well before she came to power at City Hall, and it is likely to be tested further in coming negotiations over a new contract for rank-and-file officers. Lightfoot led a civilian task force that once demanded changes to the police contract in the wake of the shooting death of Laquan McDonald by a Chicago cop later convicted of aggravated battery and second-degree murder. Now Kevin Graham, the president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, is seeking some changes of his own to a recent legal agreement between the city and the Illinois Attorney General that mandates changes in the way officers are trained, supervised and disciplined. To bolster his case for revisions, Graham said in a recent interview with the Chicago Sun-Times that even the federal government has qualms about the consequences of court-enforced civil-rights agreements aimed at controlling police conduct. The Justice Department, Graham said, has ""seen in the past that consent decrees don’t work, that there’s very little change, that oftentimes immediately after a consent decree goes into effect, crime actually goes up."" Under President Donald Trump, the Justice Department has indeed backed away from imposing consent decrees on police, including in Chicago where one pending agreement arranged near the end of the Obama administration was scrapped. Graham’s comments suggest there’s solid, statistical evidence underpinning that policy shift. We decided to find out if that is so. To support Graham’s claim, a spokesperson for the union sent us an excerpt from an academic report that found an uptick in crime among the 31 cities that came under federal oversight between 1994 and 2016. What Graham left out, though, is that the study also found those increases were temporary and diminished into statistical insignificance over time. Stephen Rushin, the study’s co-author, said Graham’s characterization of the findings were an oversimplification. ""It would be fair to say there’s some empirical support for the claim that consent decree cities have seen maybe an uptick in crime relative to unaffected cities,"" said Rushin, a professor at the Loyola University Chicago School of Law. ""But, again it’s more complicated because our research … found that after a few years, that relationship goes away."" ""To say that they (consent decrees) don’t work, at minimum is misleading,"" Rushin also said. ""I don’t think anyone — even folks who have spent their life doing this — would think it’s perfect. But I think to say that it just doesn’t work and everyone knows it, that’s not true."" Rushin and other experts told us that crime rates aren’t the only factor to consider when weighing the potential costs and benefits of consent decrees. For instance, a widely cited study from the University of Texas-Dallas found that cities operating under such agreements saw a decrease in civil rights lawsuits against police. ""These (crime) numbers are not destiny and there are good examples of cities as big as Chicago going through these kinds of very disruptive processes and coming out the end a much safer and seemingly more constitutional police department,"" Rushin said. One example is Los Angeles, which operated under a consent decree between 2000 and 2013. A report from the Harvard Kennedy School found that crime did rise in the first couple years of the consent decree, but at a clip no faster than it did across all of California. Then, after the initial phase-in period, crime in Los Angeles began to fall at a far faster rate than was experienced in other California cities not operating under federal oversight, the study found. That report also found the number of L.A. officers named in misconduct complaints decreased substantially over the years even as officers made more stops and arrests. ""If the consent decree has kept police officers from dealing with crime or criminals, there is no sign of it in the data on enforcement activity,"" the study’s authors noted. Experts pointed to a number of potential explanations for increases in crime immediately after a consent decree takes effect, among them unfamiliarity among officers with new restrictions on their conduct and often an initial lack of buy-in among rank-and-file. Jonathan Smith, a former Obama administration Justice Department official who now directs the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, pointed to another important variable. ""The Department of Justice only comes in when a police department’s in crisis,"" he said, citing a consent decree in Baltimore that followed unrest triggered by the death in police custody of a young black man. ""To say that somehow them coming in creates the crisis — the causal relationship doesn’t exist there."" Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, expressed deep skepticism of the value of consent decrees. In several speeches, he made a claim we twice rated Mostly False that a spike in Chicago’s murder rate was caused by a similar kind of settlement agreement between Chicago and the American Civil Liberties Union. But the most recent department analysis on the effectiveness of consent decrees was published during the Obama administration and came to a very different conclusion. It summarized findings of independent studies that examined several different cities operating under consent decrees, including Los Angeles, and noted those reports ""provide strong evidence that reform under the Division’s agreements generally succeed in bringing about more effective constitutional policing practices and improved police-community relations"" without jeopardizing public safety. Graham said the Justice Department has ""seen in the past"" that police department ""consent decrees don’t work, that there’s very little change, that oftentimes immediately after a consent decree goes into effect, crime actually goes up."" His office pointed us to an academic report that found court-enforced interventions were associated with an uptick in crime. What he left out is that the same report found those effects to be temporary. Experts also pointed out that such an increase doesn’t negate the progress cities under consent decrees have made in the years following implementation when it comes to improving relations between police and members of the communities they protect. Trump’s Justice Department has indeed stepped back from pushing for reforms at individual police agencies. But the same agency had lauded progress fostered by consent decrees and concluded they did not appear to endanger public safety. We rate Graham’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2019/jun/30/kevin-graham/chicago-police-union-presidents-attack-consent-dec/

Michael Kearns' claim about undocumented drivers getting special privileges is wrong
","Erie County Clerk Michael Kearns has emerged as one of the most vocal opponents of New York state’s new law allowing people who are in the country illegally to obtain driver’s licenses.  In a tweet on the day the New York State Senate passed the Green Light Bill and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed it, Kearns, whose office oversees the Erie County Department of Motor Vehicles, claimed the law offers undocumented immigrants ""protections that US citizens don’t receive.""  When reached by phone, Kearns said he was referring to a section in the new law that requires motor vehicle commissioners to give notice to an individual within three days in the event an immigration enforcement agency requests information about that individual.  Drivers whose information is requested by other law enforcement agencies do not get a three-day notice. ""There’s a different standard,"" he said. ""That’s a protection that I don’t have now.""  New York lawmakers’ decision to grant driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants has provoked a strong reaction from people who are opposed to the idea. So we decided to look into Kearns’ claim.  The Green Light Law allows undocumented immigrants to obtain standard (non-commercial) driver’s licenses.  It prevents DMV employees from turning over information to immigration enforcement agencies without a judicial warrant or court order. If a warrant or court order is received by the DMV, directing employees to hand over records or information about a driver to an immigration authority, DMV commissioners must notify the driver, regardless of the driver’s immigration status, about the request within three days. Kearns claims that this notification is a special protection for undocumented drivers. While this provision may alert undocumented drivers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection agents are asking about them, one expert we spoke with noted that it could help everyone.  There is a history of ICE wrongly targeting U.S. citizens for deportation, said Kendra Sena, senior staff attorney at the Government Law Center at Albany Law School.  In 2008, a man born in North Carolina, with no Mexican heritage, was wrongly deported to Mexico and eventually settled his case with the federal government. In 2013, Syracuse University published a study showing ICE had issued detainers, a notice that they planned to apprehend an individual, for 834 U.S. citizens and 28,489 legal permanent residents, in the previous four years. In the last two years, ICE’s efforts to detain naturalized and native-born U.S. citizens have made headlines, including the case of a U.S. Marine born in Michigan. Sena said the notice provision applies in the immigration context but not in others because the consequences of immigration action can be so severe.   The provision that provides notice to drivers who have caught the attention of immigration enforcement applies to every driver, regardless of their immigration status, said Fabien Levy, press secretary for the State Attorney General’s Office.  Under the law, the response by DMV to agencies requesting information does not change based on the immigration status of the driver, said Nicole Hallett, director of the Community Justice Clinic at the University at Buffalo School of Law.  ""There is no scenario in which an agency would make two requests for information, one regarding a citizen and one regarding an undocumented immigrant, and would be permitted to comply with the former but not the latter,"" Hallett said. ""The DMV would either be prohibited from complying in both or be permitted to comply in both depending on the identity of the agency.""   Kearns said that undocumented immigrants receive protections under the Green Light law that are not afforded to U.S. citizens.  Under the law, if an immigration enforcement agency obtains a court order or judicial warrant to secure information about a driver, the DMV must notify the driver within three days. This notification would happen regardless of whether the driver is in the country legally or not.  While this provision may help more undocumented drivers than those drivers with documentation, all are treated equally under this provision.  We rate Kearns’ statement False.   ",/factchecks/2019/jun/29/michael-kearns/kearns-claims-undocumented-drivers-get-special-pri/

FACT CHECK: Did Kamala Harris really disagree with Obama’s deportation policy?
","California Sen. Kamala Harris claimed yesterday that during her time as the state’s attorney general, she ""disagreed"" with President Obama’s use of the Secure Communities program that partnered local and federal authorities to deport people who were in the country illegally.  Harris was elected California attorney general in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. She made the claim about disagreeing with Obama during her breakout performance at the Democratic presidential debate in Miami, along with other impassioned assertions on civil rights and the economy that we fact-checked here.  Harris was responding to a moderator’s question of whether a person living in the United States, ""without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?"" ""I will say — no, absolutely not, they should not be deported. And I actually —  this was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I always had a great relationship and a great deal of respect. ""But on the secure communities issue, I was attorney general of California. I led the second-largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, in a state of 40 million people. ""I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by ICE's own definition were non-criminals. So as attorney general, and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers, and instead should make decisions based on the best interests of public safety of their community."" President Obama halted Secure Communities in 2014 following opposition from states and cities who said it eroded trust between local police and undocumented communities. President Trump restarted it shortly after taking office in 2017.  Given the controversial history of the Obama-era policy, we wanted to know: Did Harris really disagree with it? And, if so, how much? And what did she do about it?  We set out on a fact check.   Democratic presidential candidates former vice president Joe Biden, left, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., right, stand on stage for the Democratic primary debate, Wednesday, June 27, 2019, in Miami (AP). Our research There’s some evidence Harris disagreed with Secure Communities. In 2014, then-AG Harris advised local police and sheriff’s departments, in the form of a bulletin, that they did not have to comply with ICE detainer requests.  ""Federal immigration detainers are voluntary and this bulletin supports the TRUST Act and law enforcement leaders’ discretion to utilize resources in a manner that best serves their communities,"" Harris said in a news release that announced the bulletin.  Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed The Trust Act  in 2013. It limited local police and sheriff’s cooperation with federal immigration agents, and was a precursor of the state’s sanctuary law, SB 54, signed by Brown in 2017, which further limited that cooperation.  Harris’ news release said that two years earlier, in 2012, she issued another ""information bulletin"" to law enforcement agencies clarifying that federal immigration detainers ""are not mandatory, but are merely requests enforceable at the discretion of the state and local agency.""  Several immigration experts said these memos show Harris resisted the Obama-era policy, at least to some degree. But, they said, that resistance did not take place early on. ""The bulletin on detainers was meaningful,"" UC Davis Law School Dean Kevin R. Johnson said in an email. ""It allowed local law enforcement agencies"" discretion ""to not detain low level offenders.""  ""Attorney General Harris was not as aggressive in opposing President Obama’s immigration policies as Attorney General Xavier Becerra has opposed President Trump’s,"" Johnson added. ""She could be criticized for that but she was a Democrat wanting to work with a Democratic administration.  It is clear that Senator Harris now is quite willing to criticize the immigration enforcement policies of this Republican administration."" Harris silent early on  The Huffington Post published an in-depth report last week on Harris’ lack of action early in California’s debate over immigrant protections.  It found Harris remained ""largely silent,"" from 2011 to 2013 as activists and lawmakers worked to pass the Trust Act, a landmark statewide sanctuary law over the objections of then-Gov. Jerry Brown and the Obama administration.  ""The Trust Act was a new way to limit ICE at the state level,"" Angela Chan, policy director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, told the HuffingtonPost. ""We were at the forefront. She didn’t get why it was important to support it at the time. … She only signaled support when it was safe to do so.""  Sameer Ashar, a UCLA law professor and former co-director of the UC Irvine Immigrant Rights Clinic, told us the record is mixed on Harris’ position.  ""My general sense is there was a lot of grassroots movement pressure on elected officials in California to direct local law enforcement not to cooperate with the federal government on immigration enforcement,"" Ashar said. ""And she responded to that pressure. She took some positive steps, but it was under great pressure.""  He added: ""She never led in California on the fight at the time. If anything, she led from behind … She has evolved over time.""  Harris’ campaign cited a 2009 Los Angeles Times article that paraphrased then-San Francisco District Attorney Harris as saying, ""It is not the duty of local law enforcement, she said, to enforce federal immigration laws.""  The campaign also cited a 2011 San Francisco Chronicle report. It quoted then-AG Harris’ spokeswoman saying her office ""was broadly examining the issue of Secure Communities and taking a serious look at the program.""  By late 2012, Harris was more vocal in her opposition, describing the program in news articles as ""flawed,"" and ""has not held up to what it aspired to be,"" as her campaign pointed out. Our ruling Kamala Harris claimed she ""disagreed"" with the Obama administration on a deportation program where local police and sheriffs partnered with federal immigration agents to remove people who were in the country illegally.   As attorney general in 2012 and again in 2014, Harris issued bulletins telling local law enforcement they did not have to comply with the program’s federal immigration detainer requests. She was also quoted in news articles in late 2012 strongly opposing the program. But immigration experts say Harris was largely absent in California’s early efforts to pass laws limiting local cooperation with federal agents. She resisted the program, they said, only after pressure built to pass those state laws and then ""led from behind,"" as one expert described it.  Harris’ statement about disagreeing is partially accurate, but it leaves out some key history and takes things out of context.

Joe Biden oversimplifies his school busing record in Miami debate
","Sen. Kamala Harris of California attacked Joe Biden for his position on busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s. In the second democratic debate in Miami, Harris said that Biden worked with segregationist senators to oppose busing. Harris asked Biden: ""do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?"" Biden responded: ""No. … I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That’s what I opposed."" (We’ll note the Education Department wasn’t established until 1979, but his general point was that he opposed busing if it was federally mandated either directly or through funding rules.) We found that Biden tried to oversimplify his complicated record on busing. He glossed over the fact that he regularly opposed busing, even though he supported other civil rights measures such as the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. Biden won his Senate seat in 1972 on a platform of integration, but once in office, he faced white constituents who hated the idea of busing. A federal court order in 1974 to integrate Wilmington schools brought the issue home for Biden. In the Senate, Biden began supporting much of the anti-busing legislation. University of New Hampshire historian Jason Sokol, who tracked Biden’s response to local opposition, has told us the amendments that Biden supported ""paint a somewhat muddled picture."" Biden proposed some amendments that would have hamstrung desegregation while at other times he backed off. Sokol told us after the debate that Biden’s position on busing evolved but by the late 1970s he was decidedly against busing.  Biden’s claim that he was for integration but against busing doesn’t make a lot of sense, he told PolitiFact. ""By that point in history, there were very few school districts voluntarily integrating by other means, which is why judges were ordering busing. He is using disingenuous logic,"" he said. The Biden campaign pointed to exceptions, including in 1974 when he voted to table an anti-busing amendment sponsored by Sen. Edward Gurney, R-Fla.. The amendment to an education bill was tabled by a single vote on May 15, 1974. The New York Times called the vote a victory for liberals. In 1975, Biden supported an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, a North Carolina conservative who opposed civil rights, while stating he didn’t share all the views of those who opposed busing.  The amendment was intended to prevent the federal government from collecting any data about the race of students or teachers in an effort to protect districts that refused to integrate.  ""I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept that, in fact, does not bear any of the fruit for which it was designed,"" Biden said. ""If anything, it obfuscates the real issue today which is whether or not there is equal opportunity within the educational field for all people within the United States.""  Biden urged his colleagues to reject busing and focus on access to housing, employment, credit, and voting rights, wrote Brett Gadsden, Northwestern University historian and author of ""Between North and South: Delaware, Desegregation, and the Myth of American Sectionalism."" When the Helms amendment defeated, Biden proposed an amendment to prohibit the use of federal funds to assign teachers or students to schools based on race.  Biden said that his amendment would not preclude court-ordered busing, Gadsden wrote, making it an ""admission of a certain incongruity between his legislative efforts and the concerns of his white constituents who were concerned about an impending court-ordered busing mandate."" The Senate affirmed Biden’s amendment by a vote of 50–43. Biden then introduced another amendment that narrowly targeted busing — rather than roundly forbidding all desegregation remedies. This amendment passed, too. The Senate passed the education bill with Biden’s anti-busing amendments, but after the House-Senate conference they were dropped from the final bill. The Washington Post this year cited an interview Biden gave to the People Paper, a Newark, Del., publication, in 1975: ""To 'desegregate' is different than to 'integrate.' . . . I am philosophically opposed to quota systems. They insure mediocrity."" In his book ""Promises to Keep,"" Biden recounted facing a group of constituents who were angry about busing during the 1978 election.  ""Look, I told them, I was against busing to remedy de facto segregation owing to housing patterns and community comfort,"" he said, recounting what he told people in a high school gym in Wilmington. ""But if it was intentional segregation, I’d personally pay for helicopters to move the children. There were howls in the crowd.""  Biden’s campaign pointed to a news story about Biden in 1975 in which he defended busing in certain scenarios. ""In cases where a school system has racially segregated by gerrymandering district lines or by other legalistic means, Biden said he supports desegregation by any legal means at hand – including busing,"" according to the Wilmington News Journal. ""However, for school districts which are all white or all black ‘because of historical pattern not involving segregation practices disapproved by a court’ he is against busing."" The Biden campaign pointed to examples of African Americans, both in the past and this year, who criticized the idea of busing in major cities in the U.S. ""It was the biggest sham,"" said longtime Wilmington education activist Bebe Coker told the Delaware News Journal in April. ""It destroyed our community."" Biden said ""I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education."" Biden qualified his opposition to busing by saying opposing the federal government forcing busing on communities. But the record shows Biden opposed busing, as shown through his positions on legislation, and statements multiple times starting the mid 1970s. We’ll note that while Biden opposed busing in the face of protests from his constituents, he nevertheless supported many other aspects desegregation and civil rights.  We rate Biden’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/jun/28/joe-biden/joe-biden-oversimplifies-his-record-school-busing-/

No, the first slaves shipped to the American colonies weren’t white Irish children
","The day after a congressional hearing to discuss legislation that would create a commission to study reparations for African Americans, an old claim about white, Irish slaves gained steam. ""The first slaves shipped to the Americans Colonies in 1619 were 100 white children from Ireland,"" reads the text of an image shared on Facebook on June 20. ""Truth matters."" The post, which features a black-and-white photo of three children, adds that the Irish arrived in the colonies ""four months before the arrival of a the (sic) first shipment of black slaves."" ""White slavery,"" it says, ""history denied, covered up, & marginalized.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because it’s not true.  Leslie Harris, a history professor at Northwestern University, told PolitiFact the claim is ""part of an attempt by several groups of people to claim that Irish people were enslaved in the Americas before and in excess of the numbers of people of African descent."" But Irish people were not enslaved in the Americas, she said, and people of African descent ""far outnumbered European migrants to the Americas before the 19th century.""  Harris directed us to Liam Hogan, a research librarian in Ireland who she described as the most knowledgeable source on claims of Irish slavery. Both Harris and Hogan are quoted in a 2017 New York Times story titled: ""Debunking a myth: The Irish were not slaves, too.""  As it turns out, Hogan also debunked this exact claim and image after actor James Woods shared it on his Twitter account on April 17. Responding in a Twitter thread that very day, Hogan started with the photo, which he said is a famous Lewis Hine picture showing three child laborers at a canning company at Port Royal, South Carolina, in 1911. (The Library of Congress has a digital file of the photo here.) In 1619, Hogan says in the thread, 100 ""poor English children"" between the ages of 8 and 16 were ""taken from the streets of London and sent to Virginia and sold into indentured servitude. This was a radical extension of the English Poor Law of 1601."" Meanwhile, Hogan says in the thread, there were 1,301 slave trading voyages from 1514-1619 involving about 500,000 Africans. ""In reality,"" Hogan adds, ""thousands of Irish people were sold as servants (most voluntarily) while (approximately) 1,900,000 Africans were shipped to the colonies as slaves (always involuntarily.)"" Hogan pointed us to another Twitter thread he wrote on the subject in November 2018. There, he explained more about the 100 English children sent to Virginia as part of the Poor Law that directed the children of paupers to work in the homes of other families as apprentices. Those that survived the journey to America, Hogan said, were to be apprentices for seven years.  Certainly, said Michael Guasco, a history professor at Davidson College, there was forced transportation and convict servitude in the American colonies. ""Certainly, things often did not work out well for people in these situations,"" he told us. ""Certainly, there were conversations about the use of slavery as a form of criminal punishment in England and some of the colonies in the 16th and 17th centuries. And, certainly, plenty of people from Europe complained about being treated or bought and sold like slaves (especially in the 17th century). BUT, there weren’t really Irish or English slaves in colonial America."" Such an argument is part of a bigger effort to minimize the tragedy of slavery, Guasco said. ""The argument that ‘whites were slaves too’ or ‘indentured servants were just like slaves’ are both distortions of the past.""  We rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2019/jun/28/viral-image/no-first-slaves-shipped-american-colonies-werent-w/

No evidence Robert De Niro made this statement comparing Trump to a village idiot
","Robert De Niro has called President Donald Trump a ""fool,"" a ""bozo"" and an ""idiot,"" among other digs. Did this motion picture icon take it one step further and also call the commander in chief a village idiot?  ""I preferred the time in America when the president and the village idiot were two different people,"" reads the text below a photo of Robert De Niro speaking. It was posted on June 23 on the Occupy Democrats Facebook page, where commenters cheered the actor on.   ""Thank you Robert!"" one account said. ""I wish I could have said it better."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  After searching for the quote as it appears in the post online we only found one result: a February post on another Facebook page that doesn’t attribute the statement to De Niro. The image in the post comes from a 2016 video released by Anonymous Content as part of a ""Get Out the Vote"" campaign featuring celebrities. But De Niro doesn’t make the statement in the Facebook post in that video.  He also didn’t say it at last year’s Tony Awards in June 2018, when he walked on stage and declared, ""f--- Trump."" Searching the Nexis news database for ""Robert De Niro"" and ""village idiot"" and ""Donald Trump"" we found no results. Searching for the same words online, we found instances of the insult slung at both De Niro and Trump, but not De Niro calling Trump a ""village idiot.""  If evidence surfaces proving the actor made this statement, we’ll reconsider our ruling. For now, we rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2019/jun/28/viral-image/no-evidence-robert-de-niro-made-statement-comparin/
