John Carter says Barack Obama wants to house 'illegal aliens' on military installations
","An Austin-area U.S. House member maintains that President Barack Obama has dangerous desires for military installations. U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, opened his commentary in the March 10, 2016, Round Rock Leader: ""This is not a joke: the president wants to house illegal aliens on our nation’s military installations."" Carter, saying that such a move would hinder troops’ effectiveness, wrote: ""With the growing global threats of terrorism, how could any president think that housing illegal immigrants on military installations is the right thing to do?"" His column also touted his 2016 proposal to bar such installations from sheltering anyone lacking ""lawful immigration status."" We wondered what Carter was talking about. By phone, Carter spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer said he was referring to an administration move that could have led to children lacking legal residency staying at Fort Hood, which is partially in Carter’s district. Schiermeyer said Carter learned in late 2015 that the Department of Defense had received a request for assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services to provide temporary housing for ""unaccompanied alien children."" Schiermeyer said Carter also was told a survey team would be investigating various U.S. locations, including Fort Hood in Killeen. We asked Schiermeyer if Obama had signaled his own desires to house immigrants on bases. She said: ""If the president did not want this to happen, that request would never have been sent."" We also sought documentation of the described plans; by phone, Schiermeyer urged us to obtain a November 2015 Pentagon memo to military officials that she said described the HHS request. We failed to come up with the memo but a White House spokesman, Peter Boogaard, emailed us a Dec. 7, 2015, letter from Sylvia M. Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, stating that ""we anticipate needing to establish shelter facilities on DOD installations very soon."" Burwell’s letter requested assistance in ""exploring a staged response in activating up to 5,000 temporary beds as quickly as"" possible. Burwell’s letter advised that her request came about because an ""unprecedented"" over 10,000 ""unaccompanied children"" apprehended along the country’s southwest border had been referred by Homeland Security in October and November 2015 to HHS for temporary housing. ""Although HHS has 8,400 current bed capacity,"" Burwell wrote, ""the highest in the history of the"" unaccompanied children ""program, we anticipate reaching 95% capacity within 10 days if recent trends continue."" According to the Administration for Children and Families, part of HHS, an unaccompanied ""alien"" child is ""a child who has no lawful immigration status in the United States; has not attained 18 years of age; and, with respect to whom, there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or no parent or legal guardian in the United States available to provide care and physical custody."" A Dec. 8, 2015, New York Times news story on Burwell’s request said youths had crossed into the U.S. mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras with several factors possibly explaining the late-in-the-year uptick, especially a surge in violence in El Salvador. Fort Hood facilities assessed And what of Fort Hood? By email, an HHS spokesman, Mark Weber, confirmed that after the Pentagon heard from HHS, an assessment of Fort Hood took place in advance of children possibly living at the base though, Weber said, that ""was determined not to be a viable option at this time."" A Dec. 20, 2015, Killeen Daily Herald news story said buildings chosen for the assessment were in North Fort Hood, near Gatesville, in an area the ""National Guard wants to use for soldiers who train at North Fort Hood throughout the year."" On Dec. 17, 2015, Carter announced he’d sent a letter to the president and other administration officials expressing his opposition to the government providing temporary housing for ""unaccompanied alien children at any U.S. military installation, including Fort Hood."" On Jan. 6, 2016, Carter posted a statement saying that ""after many discussions"" with Homeland Security, Fort Hood was no longer on the list of possible temporary shelter locations. And in February Carter introduced the Resist Executive Amnesty on Defense Installations Act, which would prohibit ""the use of military installations to house"" any ""aliens who do not have a lawful immigration status or are undergoing removal proceedings in the United States,"" which was referred to the House Armed Services Committee. Elsewhere, Weber told us, the Defense Department made space available to temporarily house 250 children at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, making possible housing for about 700 children. Children stayed on the base in January and February 2016, Weber said. Then the space went into ""suspended"" status after children were resettled with relatives, HHS spokeswoman Andrea Helling said by phone. Weber further advised that the Homestead Job Corps facility in Florida--lately vacant and not in operation as a Job Corps center--had been lined up to provide approximately 800 temporary shelter beds for unaccompanied children, if needed. In May 2016, Boogaard told us by email that ""no DoD facilities are being used as temporary shelters, but such facilities could be used in the future if it becomes necessary and provided that such use would not impact DoD operations."" Administration: Bases have sheltered children before As we looked into Carter’s claim, administration officials pointed out there’s precedent for children staying on bases--in accord with federal law. The first time vacant space was used to house children at a military base was in 2012, Weber said, at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio and HHS in 2014 opened three temporary shelters on bases to help the government handle a spurt in unaccompanied children apprehended near the border, Weber said. Temporary shelters at Lackland AFB, Fort Sill Army Base and Naval Base Ventura County-Port Hueneme ""played a critical role in the humanitarian response, providing care to more than 7,700 children,"" Weber said, before HHS ""suspended"" the shelters in August 2014. Thousands of children annually enter the U.S. without legal permission -- sometimes without parents or guardians along. Next, the government detains many in advance of releases to family members and immigration hearings. In the 12 months through September 2015, the U.S. Border Patrol reported detaining nearly 40,000 unaccompanied children hailing from Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. That count was down from 68,451 children detained in the region the previous 12 months -- with many crossers coming in expectation of an immigration hearing and amid fears of violence, especially gang violence, in home countries, we noted in a June 2014 fact check. Two laws guide how the government manages unaccompanied minors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the care and custody of ""unaccompanied alien children"" to HHS to ""move towards a child welfare-based-model of care for children and away from the adult detention model,"" according to a ""fact sheet"" last updated in January 2016 by the Administration for Children and Families. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, under ACF, places children in shelter facilities, foster care or group homes, residential treatment centers or secure care facilities, the agency says. In fiscal 2015, children stayed in an agency-supervised facility for an average of 34 days, according to the sheet. According to the ""fact sheet,"" the Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 requires HHS to promptly place each child in the ""least restrictive setting that is in the best interest to the child, taking into account potential flight risk and danger to self and others."" That act (which cleared the House without objection) has no proscription on placing children in federal facilities. Our ruling Carter said, ""This is not a joke: the president wants to house illegal aliens on our nation’s military installations."" It’s correct that on Obama’s watch, the U.S. agency responsible for temporarily caring for unaccompanied immigrant children has enlisted the Pentagon in occasionally sheltering children (a ""minors"" detail that didn’t appear in Carter’s commentary). Carter didn’t show nor did we spot an administration push to house adults on such installations. Also unsaid: The temporary housing of children in vacant military facilities is permitted under existing law. We rate Carter’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Florida agency's misleading attack on California's minimum wage hike
","Florida Gov. Rick Scott is not on board with the minimum wage increase in the sunny, oceanside state — of California. As Scott toured the West Coast for the second time attempting to attract businesses, Enterprise Florida (the state’s public-private economic development arm) ran radio ads in San Francisco and Los Angeles attacking California’s $15 wage and trumpeting Florida’s superior job prospects. ""Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage,"" the ad says, as the Miami Herald reports. ""Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them."" California Gov. Jerry Brown didn’t take this lying down, penning a letter welcoming Scott back to California, ""a state that in the last year has added more jobs than Florida and Texas combined,"" and not-so-subtly suggested Scott worry about more pressing matters back home. ""Rick, a fact you’d like to ignore: California is the 7th largest economic power in the world. We’re competing with nations like Brazil and France, not states like Florida,"" Brown wrote on May 2. ""If you’re truly serious about Florida’s economic well-being, it’s time to stop the silly political stunts and start doing something about climate change – two words you won’t even let state officials say. The threat is real and so too will be the devastating impacts."" Here, we’ll look at Scott’s claim that California will lose almost as many jobs as Florida will gain. The ad is comparing California's projected employment with Florida's past performance — an apples-to-oranges comparison. It also distorts what the 700,000 jobs-lost figure actually refers to. Even with the wage hike, California is expected to gain more jobs than Florida over the next decade, albeit not as many as without it. Furthermore, all the economists we spoke with cautioned against pinning a figure to the minimum wage hike’s impact on employment in California. All that glitters in Golden State jobs A spokesperson for Scott cited a post by American Action Forum, a self-described center-right policy institute, as the source of the 700,000 lost jobs. But the figure doesn’t refer to a decline in the total number jobs in the state, as the ad suggests. Rather, it’s the difference between the number of jobs that California could have gained without and with the wage hike. California will gradually increase the current $10 hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022. According to the institute's labor market policy director, Ben Gitis, that will lead to a 3.5 percent decrease in employment growth or about 692,235 jobs by 2026 that could have been added if the wage did not increase. Gitis walked us through his math. He used the California Employment Development Department’s latest 10-year forecast, which projects that the state will add 14.9 percent or 2.3 million more jobs from 2012 to 2022. Gitis then calculated the impact of the minimum wage hike; he concluded that California would see its projected 2026 jobs numbers reduced by 3.5 percent. In other words, California would have added about 3.4 million new jobs from 2012 to 2026 without the hike, but 2.7 million with it. So the state isn’t so much ""losing"" 700,000 jobs as ""forgoing"" them, said Jeremy West, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-authored the Journal of Human Resources study Gitis used for his calculations. Bright employment outlook in Sunshine State Scott’s office forwarded us a press release that says Florida has added more than a million jobs since 2010, a claim that PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. But Scott was talking about future projections for California, so we’ll look instead at the number of jobs Florida will gain in the same time frame as Gitis’ analysis. From 2012 to 2026, Florida is actually projected to add more than a million jobs. The increase, however, will still be less than California’s. (We would be remiss to not mention that California’s cost of living is higher than Florida's and its population size is almost twice as big. But as Enterprise Florida touted raw employment numbers, we’ll follow suit.) Florida added about 552,000 jobs from Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2015. According to the Florida Dept. of Economic Opportunity, the state will gain 1.1 million more jobs from 2015 to 2023. That’s a compounded annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, equal to about 445,000 new jobs from 2023 to 2026. Put it all together, Florida will add 2.1 million jobs from 2012 to 2026. That’s still 600,000 fewer jobs than California will add in the same time frame with the $15 wage. Waging in uncharted waters As we have previously reported, there’s a great amount of debate over the effect that minimum wage hikes have job growth. A spokesperson for Brown forwarded us academic and think-tank studies showing that past increases have had little or no effect on employment. California’s hike, however, is so unprecedented that past research may be less relevant. All the experts we spoke with suspect it will reduce employment. ""An increase the size of California’s is outside of the experience of any state over the last four decades,"" said Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist and co-author of the study Gitis cited. ""A dramatic increase in the minimum wage like California’s will undoubtedly reduce employment. However, I would be very cautious about putting any precise figures on the amount."" Two home-state economists — Jeffrey Clemens of the University of California, San Diego and David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine — agreed that the huge wage hike will likely cause job losses, but the magnitude is uncertain.   ""The recently passed minimum wage increases are sufficiently beyond the range of historical experience that I do not think it is possible to predict their effects on employment with any precision,"" Clemens said. Neumark added that Scott’s job-poaching mission is nonetheless ill-fated, given that the flow of jobs into or out of California is typically miniscule and the jobs most affected by hike (low-skill jobs in the service and agricultural sectors) are hard to move out of state. ""Maybe a few low-wage manufacturers will move. But there's no reason to expect they'd go to Florida more than many other low-wage states or overseas, so I suspect the employment growth in Florida from California’s minimum wage increase would be negligible, and statistically undetectable,"" Neumark said. ""So Gov. Scott is probably wasting his and his Florida taxpayers' time."" Our ruling A radio ad by Enterprise Florida said, ""Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage….Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them."" This is misleading. The 700,000 figure refers to the number of jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn’t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Based on projections, California will still gain more jobs with the minimum wage increase than Florida during the same time frame. While experts agreed that a $15 wage will reduce employment in California, they said it’s near impossible to pin a number on the impact given how unprecedented the hike is. We rate the claim Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2016/may/04/enterprise-florida/florida-agencys-misleading-attack-californias-mini/

The incomplete claim that Sen. Ron Johnson 'started' Pacur, his plastics manufacturing company
","Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who is trailing but gaining on Democratic challenger Russ Feingold in the latest poll, announced April 29, 2016 he is launching a tour of Wisconsin as part of his re-election campaign. A routine notice. Until this line in his news release: ""Ron’s statewide tour will include stops at Pacur, the Oshkosh plastics manufacturing company he started in 1979."" 
The statement suggests the company was started only by Johnson, or at least that he was main person who launched it. But that seems to contradict the established history of Pacur (pronounced liked packer), and is in conflict with some of Johnson’s own statements. It’s long been widely reported that Johnson was there at the beginning of Pacur. But with analysts saying he is among the most vulnerable Senate incumbents in the November 2016 elections, did Johnson’s campaign overstate his role in starting the company? After all, the name Pacur comes from Pat Curler -- Johnson’s brother-in-law. Rewriting history Questions first arose when Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative columnist Daniel Bice reported that Johnson had rewritten his own company history on Aug. 25, 2010. That was less than three weeks before the GOP primary and about 10 weeks before Johnson upset Feingold, an 18-year incumbent, in the 2010 Senate election. For nearly nine years, Bice wrote, Pacur carried this online description of its beginning:

Founded in 1977, Pacur occupies a facility constructed specifically for sheet extrusion, which provides polyester and polypropylene sheet and rollstock to converters, distributors, and end users. The revised description, now carrying an asterisk, said the founding occurred two years later, in 1979. The asterisk pointed out that Pacur had a predecessor -- Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies -- that came into existence in 1977 before it was renamed and restructured in 1979. In other words, Pacur grew out of an existing company, Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies. That company was owned by Curler, the brother of Johnson’s wife. Johnson’s statements Johnson’s own statements haven't always been as credit-taking as the line in the news release. Some examples from the 2010 campaign: The Journal Sentinel reported that Johnson said he began working as Pacur's accountant and co-founder in July or August of 1979. The article stated that both companies were led by Curler, and that Curler was Johnson's initial boss. Pacur ""was an opportunity for (Curler) to get into business for himself, and I just kind of came along for the ride as the accountant,"" Johnson said in another Journal Sentinel article. Johnson had been calling himself a co-founder of the company, but later acknowledged he joined several months after Pacur was established, the Associated Press reported. He started as a machine operator and accountant and eventually became its president, the article said. More recent statements also reinforce the idea that Johnson, who bought Pacur in 1997, didn't start the company alone. Johnson’s official Senate website says he started the company with Curler. So did a tweet Johnson sent in in March 2016. Defending the statement in the press release, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us Johnson ""helped build Pacur into a great Wisconsin success story, and we've never said anything counter to how it all began."" Our rating Announcing a statewide tour in his campaign for reelection, a Johnson news release said Johnson ""started"" the Pacur plastics manufacturing company he owns. The claim contradicts Pacur’s own company history and Johnson’s prior statements, which make it clear he helped start Pacur with his brother-in-law, who was more involved in the founding. Johnson didn't do it alone. The news release doesn’t indicate an attempt by Johnson to rewrite history, but he is responsible for his campaign statements, and this one left out important details. For a statement that is partially accurate but needs more information, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/may/04/ron-johnson/incomplete-claim-sen-ron-johnson-started-pacur-his/

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim linking Ted Cruz's father and JFK assassination
","Straight from the grocery aisle tabloids ... Donald Trump is linking Ted Cruz's father to the plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. ""(Cruz’s) father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald being, you know, shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right, prior to his being shot? And nobody even brings it up,"" Trump said on Fox and Friends on the morning of the critical Indiana primary. ""What was he doing — what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It’s horrible."" Is it true that Rafael Cruz ""was with"" Oswald before the assassination, or was Trump’s bombshell accusation itself ridiculous? The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us. Cruz tore into Trump, calling the billionaire ""utterly amoral"" and ""a pathological liar"" and admitting sarcastically that his father had killed JFK, ""is secretly Elvis"" and that ""Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard."" In an interview with ABC, Rafael Cruz called the claim ""ludicrous"" and ""typical Donald Trump."" Trump’s charge appears to be based on a National Enquirer report alleging that Rafael Cruz is the man standing next to Oswald in a photo from 1963. But technical experts told PolitiFact that no such firm conclusion is possible given the quality of the photograph, and several historians of the period told us they’ve never seen Cruz’s name come up in connection with Oswald.  The 1963 photo at left shows Lee Harvey Oswald (left) and an unidentified man who the National Enquirer claims is Rafael Cruz, the father of Ted Cruz. A verified image of Cruz (in 1959 wearing glasses) is at right.  Dubious photographic evidence The Enquirer based its report on photos of Oswald handing out pro-Fidel Castro pamphlets in New Orleans on Aug. 16, 1963, about four months before Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22. Two photo experts the tabloid hired — Mitch Goldstone of ScanMyPhotos, a digitizing photo service, and Carole Lieberman, a forensic expert witness — said another man in the image appears to be young Rafael Cruz, according to McClatchy. We could not independently verify these experts’ validation, as neither Goldstone nor Lieberman got back to us. When we reached out to Kairos, a Miami-based facial recognition software company, Chief Technology Officer Cole Calistra was skeptical about claims of a positive identification. Calistra told PolitiFact that the photos are too grainy ""to perform a proper match one way or the other."" James Wayman, the former director of U.S. National Biometric Test Center in the Clinton administration, said proper analysis requires two full-frontal facial images. ""Without such images, no professional face examiner will be willing to render an opinion,"" he said. That being said, we had freelance programmer Lucien Gendrot test it out using Kairos’ face recognition API. The software could not verify a match between photos of the unidentified man next to Oswald and young Rafael Cruz, even at a low threshold of a 25 percent match. In short, as Snopes wrote in an April 2016 analysis of a similar claim, the low-resolution photos are essentially ""of dark-haired young men with similar haircuts."" That’s speculation, not evidence. Would Cruz and Oswald have even run in the same circles? No In his 2016 book, A Time for Action, Rafael Cruz acknowledges being an early supporter of Fidel Castro. Cruz had agitated against Cuba’s previous leader, dictator Fulgencio Batista, which led to a beating at the hands of Batista forces in 1957. Cruz eventually applied to universities in the United States, was accepted by the University of Texas, and left by ferry to Key West, where he made his way to Austin. He attended classes and worked as a dishwasher, a story his son would often repeat on the campaign trail. Back in Cuba, Batista fled under pressure from Castro’s forces, and Castro assumed power at the beginning of 1959. Later that year, during Cruz’s summer break from college, he returned to Cuba and was ""shocked"" by the nation’s turn to communism. He left, never to return, leaving close relatives behind. In the spring of 1962, Cruz writes, he accepted a job with IBM in Dallas, where he lived for a time with his wife and two daughters from his first marriage. At some point, Cruz moved to New Orleans to take a different job, although the timeline is unclear from his book. It was in New Orleans that Cruz met his second wife, Eleanor. They had a son, the future presidential candidate, in 1970, in the Canadian city of Calgary. So Cruz checks a couple of boxes relevant to Oswald -- a stay in New Orleans (where Oswald had lived and where the photograph in question was taken), a period in Dallas (where Oswald also lived, and where he assassinated Kennedy), and an interest in Cuba. But there is nothing to suggest that this is anything more than simple coincidence. Indeed, historians of the period say that it’s unlikely that someone like Cruz would have palled around with someone like Oswald. Cruz would have already been a staunch anti-communist for several years by the time he was allegedly photographed with Oswald. Given that Oswald was handing out leaflets for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee -- a pro-Castro group -- a partnership between the two men would make no sense on its face. Moreover, it’s believed that Oswald in this period was more of a lone wolf than an organization man. The Warren Commission report examining Kennedy’s assassination quoted Marina Oswald, his widow, saying ""that her husband engaged in Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities ‘primarily for purposes of self-advertising. He wanted to be arrested. I think he wanted to get into the newspapers, so that he would be known.’ "" This interpretation rings true for Van Gosse, a Franklin & Marshall College historian and author of Where the Boys Are: Cuba, Cold War America and the Making of a New Left. Gosse said that the Fair Play for Cuba Committee had ""effectively ceased to exist by the middle of 1963,"" when the picture was taken. And to the extent the group was active at all by then, he said, it would have been in greater New York City, not a city in the South. In other words, whatever Oswald was doing pamphleting on that day in New Orleans was likely a freelance effort to ""provoke something"" that would get him attention, Gosse said. Tying Cruz to the photograph as an associate of Oswald ""just looks like a fabrication,"" Gosse said. Other experts on the period agreed that it was unlikely that Oswald and Cruz had crossed paths. ""Top leaders of anti-Castro organizations claim not to have met Cruz, and I have never come across his name in declassified records,"" said María Cristina García, a Cornell University historian and author of Havana USA: Cuban Exiles and Cuban Americans in South Florida, 1959-1994. ""You can be sure that if there is any dirt on Rafael Cruz, the Castro government will find it and release it."" William M. LeoGrande, an American University government professor and author of Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations between Washington and Havana, agreed. ""I have never come across Mr. Cruz's name as a pro-Castro activist,"" he said. David Abraham, a law professor at the University of Miami, concurred that the pairing sounds unlikely. ""I know of no evidence that would have put Cruz in the world of Oswald,"" Abraham said. ""The Fair Play for Cuba Committee types were a mix of ideological supporters of socialist transformation and romantic innocents. Whatever one thinks Oswald was, Cruz was neither of these, so I would doubt that they would have met."" And Steven Beschloss, author of The Gunman and His Mother: Lee Harvey Oswald, Marguerite Oswald and The Making of an Assassin, finds nothing to the supposed link. ""Any effort to find a more meaningful connection that somehow implicates Cruz Sr. seems outlandish at best,"" Beschloss said. Our ruling Trump said that Rafael Cruz ""was with Lee Harvey Oswald"" before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The sole ""evidence"" for this claim is a grainy photograph that shows Oswald with a man who may bear a resemblance to Cruz. But experts tell PolitiFact that the image is too degraded to offer much confidence. At the same time, multiple experts about the world of early 1960s pro-Castro advocacy said they have never seen evidence of Cruz associating with Oswald and consider Trump’s claim implausible at best and ridiculous at worst.

Ads attacking Tarkanian's NRA grade need context
","Politicians on both sides often wear National Rifle Association grades as a badge of pride, but one Nevada Republican is fighting off claims that he received a failing grade from the gun advocacy group. Republican Danny Tarkanian, who’s running for Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, is the target of a series of Web ads promoted by his primary opponent, state Sen. Michael Roberson, attacking his alleged poor grades from the NRA. The ads implied that Tarkanian has a poor record on Second Amendment issues, with one claiming that he is ""playing games with our gun rights.""  Only a handful of Nevada lawmakers have been the recipient of NRA F marks. We wanted to know if Tarkanian really received a failing grade, and if so, why. Failing grade NRA grades and endorsements are made by lobbyists and analysts who follow state and federal firearm issues, and are generally only supposed to represent a snapshot in time. ""Candidate ratings for previous election cycles were compiled in the year of the election and may no longer accurately represent a candidate’s or elected official’s position or rating,"" the NRA’s website says. (The NRA did not return our requests for comment on this fact-check.) Tarkanian’s F grade came a decade ago, during his Tarkanian’s unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state. But isn’t such a simple snapshot of his position on guns. During that 2006 race, the pro-gun control Brady Campaign for Gun Violence released a recorded robo-call supporting his candidacy. Tarkanian told PolitiFact that he doesn’t dispute the grade, but he never solicited the endorsement. ""I didn’t know about it, and I didn’t ask for it,"" he said. ""I have never in my life spoken to the Brady organization."" The timeline on the grade is slightly murky. Tarkanian says he wasn’t involved, and the NRA’s former lobbyist covering Nevada, Carrie Herbertson, passed away in 2014. But former Brady Campaign president Paul Helmke said someone from the Tarkanian campaign solicited the endorsement, because the group doesn’t typically involve itself in down-ballot races. ""There’s no way we would have been involved in (the) secretary of state race in Nevada unless somebody from the campaign got involved,"" he said. Dan Burdish, who served as an unpaid adviser to Tarkanian in 2006, said his memory was fuzzy but he believed the failing grade was due to confusion over some of the topics on the questionnaire. ""It just got screwed up,"" he said. Burdish said Tarkanian’s mother, Las Vegas City Councilwoman Lois Tarkanian, contacted the Brady Campaign about endorsing him in the secretary of state race against eventual winner Ross Miller, who got an A from the NRA in 2006. Lois Tarkanian didn’t return multiple calls seeking comment. Second Amendment issues didn’t appear to play a major role in the race, as a cached version of Tarkanian’s 2006 campaign website doesn’t mention firearms and a pre-election preview in the Las Vegas Sun doesn’t mention guns. The F rating resurfaced during Tarkanian’s 2010 run for U.S. Senate, when his then-primary opponent Sue Lowden tried to revive it as a campaign issue. Tarkanian campaign manager James Fisfis told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2009 that earlier poor grades were the result of a ""misunderstanding"" with the surveys. Tarkanian didn’t fill out the questionnaire in 2004 during his run for state Senate, and he received a C+ during his 2012 bid for a U.S. House seat. There’s no record of a grade during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate primary bid in 2010. Nevada Firearms Coalition president Don Turner said his state-based group gave Tarkanian an A rating in 2014, but doesn’t plan to endorse in the current primary. Roberson has a consistent A from the NRA, receiving high marks during his 2010 and 2014 state Senate elections. Tarkanian has generally run on a pro-Second Amendment platform since 2010. He’s written multiple op-eds highly critical of an assault weapon ban and supported reciprocity for concealed weapon permits throughout different states. On his current campaign website, Tarkanian clearly states his firearm policy: ""I oppose any and all efforts to register guns and their owners, and I oppose any and all efforts to restrict the sale or ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens."" Our ruling A series of Web ads claim Tarkanian has an F rating from the NRA.

Grayson right about lack of paid vacation in U.S. but misses details
","American workers aren’t getting the compensation they deserve, in either time or money, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson said at a recent Orlando debate. At a Senate campaign debate with U.S. Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, on April 25, 2016, Grayson said he supported a higher minimum wage. Providing more pay won’t hurt the businesses, he said, because other nations have higher wages with no ill effects. Furthermore, many countries also guarantee paid time off and their economies are fine, Grayson said. But not the United States. ""There's only three countries in the entire world where there's no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them. The other two are in Africa,"" he said. That stat stopped us cold, and not just because we’re overdue for a long weekend off. Could Grayson be right that the United States is one of the only countries in the entire world that doesn’t grant a legal right to paid time off? Well, not exactly; Grayson’s campaign admitted he had misspoken. But available research shows he’s not far off the mark by suggesting that America is unique by not guaranteeing vacation time. Zero guarantee Grayson campaign spokesman David Damron told us via email that the Orlando Democrat meant to say only a handful of island nations in the Pacific Ocean joined the United States in not guaranteeing paid time off — not two countries in Africa. Those five countries, according to Wikipedia, were Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and Nauru, he said. ""The congressman accidentally conflated guaranteed paid vacation and paid sick time in his recollection of which countries fell into this category of weak worker protections with the United States, which was the basis for his reference to Africa (rather than the Pacific),"" Damron wrote. We don’t take Wikipedia’s word as gospel, of course, but we could not get experts to speak to specific conditions in those five countries. Together, they have a population of around 300,000 — or about the population of Pittsburgh. The biggest repository of trusted data we found came from UCLA’s World Policy Analysis Center. Their database showed 13 countries, including the United States, with no guaranteed paid annual leave. Their list did include Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Nauru, but also larger countries like Pakistan and India. Now, sometimes leave varies by how long a worker is at a job or some other classification. The World Policy Analysis Center’s database notes they ""report the lowest amount of leave guaranteed to a worker with at least one year of tenure."" The World Bank has its own detailed numbers for vacation available to workers based on tenure. The bank measured paid annual leave for 189 economies, including splitting some countries into large metro areas. The United States, for example, is split into New York and Los Angeles. The bank’s table did list five Pacific island nations that did not guarantee paid leave time for any workers with one or more years of service: The Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Palau and Tonga. It didn’t have data for Nauru, where unemployment among its 10,000 or so residents hovered around 90 percent in 2004. If it sounds to you like those aren’t the kind of countries normally associated with a global economic powerhouse like the United States, you’d be right. Most studies on this issue stuck to smaller sets of much more comparable nations. These usually involved grouping countries with words like ""developed"" or ""rich."" For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international economic group composed of 34 generally wealthy countries, notes that in 2014 the United States was its only member country with no statutory minimum of paid days off. A 2011 Business Insider roundup using data from global human resources firm Mercer said 39 developed countries offered more vacation time than the United States. Mercer’s Worldwide Benefit and Employment Guidelines, last updated in 2015, tracks 74 countries across the planet (the Pacific island nations Damron cited are absent). It notes the United States ranks the lowest among the surveyed countries with no ""statutory holiday entitlement."" Often cited in media reports is the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s 2013 study, No-Vacation Nation Revisited. That paper compared paid vacation and paid holidays in 21 countries with advanced economies: 16 in Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. France led the pack with 30 paid vacation days. While the French get one paid holiday, Austrians get 13, plus 25 vacation days. The United Kingdom offers 28 vacation days. But almost every country in the CEPR study had more than 20 paid vacation days, except Canada and Japan, which only awarded 10. America came in dead last in guaranteed time off, with a grand total of zero days. Many employers do offer paid vacation and holidays, but there’s no law that says they must. And businesses do take advantage of the fact. ""In the absence of a legal requirement for paid vacation and paid holidays, about one fourth of the U.S. workforce has no paid vacation or paid holidays in the course of their work year,"" the CEPR report read. ""The sum of the average paid vacation and paid holidays ― 16 in total ― offered in the private sector in the United States would not meet even the minimum required by law in 19 other rich countries analyzed here."" Our ruling Grayson said, ""There's only three countries in the entire world where there's no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them."" Grayson’s claim, taken literally, is incorrect. A Grayson spokesman said the congressman had fumbled his talking point a bit, especially the part about a pair of African nations being the other two. But the point he was trying to make to viewers and voters largely holds up. The United States is certainly one of just a few countries that does not guarantee paid vacation as a right, and an outlier among developed nations. In that sense, Grayson’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/may/03/alan-grayson/grayson-right-about-lack-paid-vacation-us-misses-d/

Yep, Donald Trump gave $12K to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom & Kamala Harris
"," Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is no ally of California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. But Cruz is hoping to paint his rival for the GOP presidential nomination, Donald Trump, as a political friend of Brown and two other top Democrats in the Golden State: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Kamala Harris. ""Here in California, Donald Trump has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris,"" Cruz said during his speech on April 30 at the California Republican Party Convention south of San Francisco. Cruz went on to tell the GOP California audience: ""Y’all are experiencing first-hand the consequences of those misguided liberal policies."" We wondered if Cruz’s claim about Trump funding three top California Democrats was correct? And if so, how recently had Trump helped out these Democrats? Our research Turns out, Cruz’s claim is accurate, based on campaign finance data on the California Secretary of State’s website. But Trump’s donations to the Democrats aren’t recent. The GOP frontrunner contributed $3,500 to Brown’s run for state attorney general, making donations in 2004 and 2006. He gave $2,500 to Newsom’s 2009 truncated run for governor. And he chipped in a total of $6,000 to Harris in 2011 and 2013 for her successful re-election campaign for attorney general.  Source: California Secretary of State's website Trump has acknowledged financing both Republicans and Democrats during his long business career, all to gain political influence. Records show he gave $25,000 to the California Republican Party in 2005 and $12,000 to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state’s former Republican governor, a couple years later.

Donald Trump’s claim about receiving the most votes ever in Republican primaries is False … for now
"," Donald Trump’s march to the GOP nomination picked up steam last week, with dominant primary victories in the northeast. After the wins, several news outlets reported that the New York billionaire could break the record for most Republican primary votes in history — if Trump scores big in Indiana, New Jersey and California. Those states have yet to vote. Trump, apparently not wanting to wait, declared he’s already achieved the voting record. ""In the history of Republican primaries, I’ve gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party,"" Trump said during his speech on Friday, April 29 at the California Republican Party Convention south of San Francisco. Trump went on to say he’s broken the record without needing to wait for big states like California. Was Trump right? Had he already collected the most primary votes in history? We set out on a fact check. Our research Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics, has taken a look at the data. ""He is on pace to break the record, but he hasn’t yet,"" Ostermeier told PolitiFact California. ""I’ve seen no possible configuration of numbers that show he’s already broken it."" Ostermeier placed Trump’s primary vote total at about 10 million so far. That’s still short of the 10.8 million votes George W. Bush received in the 2000 GOP primaries. If one counts both primaries and caucuses, Trump would still be short of Bush’s overall tally, the professor said. Bush’s total is considered closer to 12 million if both types of elections are counted, he said. Ostermeier estimated Trump would likely achieve the primary vote record if he earns a strong win in California’s primary, where he could pick up more than a million additional primary votes. He said Trump’s large vote totals can be attributed to the relatively close match-up he’s had with Cruz late into the primary season. Several news articles, including by the Washington Post and Politico, used primary vote totals logged by RealClearPolitics.com. Its data show Trump has yet to break the record. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Donald Trump said he’s already earned the most Republican primary votes in history. Experts who track this say Trump is on pace to break the record, but is still shy by about 800,000 votes. They predicted a strong victory in California --- more than a month from now -- could hand Trump the milestone. We rate Trump’s claim False … for now. UPDATE: About one month after PolitiFact California rated Donald Trump’s ""most votes in history"" claim on April 29, 2016 as ""False … for now,"" the vote totals have changed. Trump now appears to have broken the all-time record for most votes in a GOP presidential primary. That’s according to Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics. Ostermeier told us on June 1, 2016 that Trump’s victory in the Washington primary on May 24, 2016 put him over the top. The rating on his April 29 claim remains the same because we judge statements based on the data available at the time. Trump got ahead of himself again during a speech in Sacramento, also on June 1, 2016, where he said he’s broken the GOP presidential primary record ""by millions"" of votes. We rated that claim ""False again … for now."" Ostermeier predicted Trump could smash the record by millions following the June 7 primary in California, New Jersey and other states.

Sanders: It's not impossible to get enough delegates to win
","With less than 20 primaries and caucuses left in the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton has about 290 more pledged delegates than her rival Bernie Sanders. To close that gap and beat her outright, the simple numbers say Sanders has to win about 65 percent of the remaining delegates. The host of CBS News’ Face the Nation, John Dickerson, pressed Sanders on his odds of pulling that off. ""To get there, many analysts who look at the pledged delegates just say, it's mathematically impossible,"" Dickerson said on May 1, 2016. ""Are they wrong?"" ""It's difficult,"" Sanders said. ""It's not impossible."" So is it possible? Or impossible? The current pledged delegate count, according to NBC News, is Clinton 1,641, Sanders 1320. If you add in the superdelegates, it’s 2,151 and 1,361. Seasoned primary watcher Alan Abramowitz at Emory University said Sanders had a point -- albeit, a limited one. ""Of course it’s mathematically possible for him to win 65 percent of the remaining pledged delegates,"" Abramowitz said, ""But the probability of that actually happening is near zero."" One way of gauging Sanders’ odds is to look at how many times he hit the 65-percent mark since the first contests in February. ""He has won that large a share of the delegates in a few caucus states,"" Abramowitz said. ""But he has never done it in a primary state other than Vermont, although he came close in New Hampshire."" The Sanders campaign sent us their count of pledged delegates. By their reckoning, he needs 64.17 percent of the remaining delegates available. This is pledged delegates, not the super delegates who are free to throw their support behind whomever they want. (The count can vary, but right now, Clinton has about 510 super delegates to Sanders’ 40, according to NBC News.) Under Democratic Party rules, the pledged delegates are divided proportionately to the number of votes each candidate gets. That means there are no winner-take-all contests as there are on the Republican side. Using numbers from the Sanders campaign, we compared the number of contests where Sanders has taken at least 64 percent of the vote to the ones when he didn’t. (We rounded down for fairness.) This table show why analysts give him long odds:  Sanders has crested the 64 percent mark on nine occasions, or about 20 percent of the time. For those who say that a 20 percent chance is tough but doable, Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, reminds us that not all primaries are equal. ""Sure, Sanders could win California, the biggest prize remaining, but by enough to capture 65 percent of its delegates?"" Kondik asked. ""Nothing is impossible, but there’s absolutely no reason to think he could do that. Additionally, is Sanders really going to win New Jersey, a mid-Atlantic state, after Clinton generally dominated him in that region? Again, very, very doubtful."" Abramowitz said the numbers don’t give Sanders any room for error. ""Even if Sanders does better than expected in the remaining states, he would only slightly reduce Clinton’s pledged delegate advantage,"" he said. Both experts told us that the Democratic Party rule of awarding delegates proportionately makes it very difficult for Sanders to gain much ground. Clinton’s strength among the super delegates, and her overall lead of about 3 million votes, further weigh him down. Our ruling Sanders said it is not impossible for him to surge past Clinton. The experts we reached agreed. Mathematically, it is not impossible. Outside the realm of theory, however, his performance in past contests shows it is far more likely that he won’t hit the winning percentage he needs. The proportional allocation rule works against Sanders, leaving him no room to fall short. Sanders' claim is accurate with a major caveat. We rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d546e1d5-6b47-4c08-962d-2b9643544db1",/factchecks/2016/may/02/bernie-sanders/sanders-its-not-impossible-get-enough-delegates-wi/

Donald Trump wrong that Hillary Clinton 'doesn’t do very well with women'
","During a May 2 interview on CNN’s New Day, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on his charge that his potential Democratic rival in November, Hillary Clinton, is playing the ""woman card."" ""She's playing the woman card,"" Trump told host Chris Cuomo. ""And if she didn't play the woman card, she would have no chance whatsoever of winning."" Trump went on to say that Clinton’s standing among female voters in particular is nothing to write home about. ""Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn’t do very well with women,"" Trump said. ""If you look at what happened recently, … in the last two weeks, including New York. I won with women by vast, vast majorities. I was way, way up with women far above anybody else in the exit polls of the recent election."" Clinton may have gleefully embraced Trump’s ""woman card"" attack line, but we thought it’s still worth checking whether Trump is right that Clinton ""doesn’t do very well with women."" Trump, as it turns out, couldn’t be more wrong. The recent primaries Let’s give Trump his due: He has a right to be braggadocious about his own record with women voters in recent GOP primaries. Trump unquestionably routed his opponents among female voters during the four recent primaries for which exit polls exist. He won 57 percent of women in the New York primary, 55 percent of women in the Connecticut primary, 50 percent of women in the Maryland primary, and 54 percent of women in the Pennsylvania primary. That said, even among women voting in these GOP primaries, Trump experiences a gender gap: According to these exit polls, women -- by a modest but consistent margin -- supported Trump by smaller margins than men did. In New York, he was six points stronger among men. In Connecticut that gap was five points, in Maryland it was nine points, and in Pennsylvania it was seven points. And there’s an even more important problem for Trump’s claim: His own success among Republican women doesn’t have anything to say about how well or poorly Clinton is doing with women. Polling a Clinton vs. Trump matchup We found seven April polls at realclearpolitics.com that asked respondents about how they would vote if Clinton faced off against Trump in November. Here’s a rundown: Poll Clinton share of female vote Trump share of female vote Lead among women IBD/TIPP 51 36 Clinton +15 Rasmussen 41 35 Clinton +6 USA Today/Suffolk 55 34 Clinton +21 GWU/Battleground 54 35 Clinton +19 NBC News/WSJ 56 33 Clinton +23 Fox News 55 33 Clinton +22 CBS News 58 31 Clinton +27 Average 53 34 Clinton +19 Clearly, this doesn’t support Trump’s assertion that Clinton ""doesn’t do very well with women."" We are still a long way from Election Day, of course, but if this pattern holds, it would represent a gender gap of historic proportions. Here’s how women have split their vote in presidential elections going back to 1980, as collected by Rutgers University's Center for the American Woman and Politics: Year Democratic candidate’s share of female vote Republican candidate’s share of female vote Independent candidate’s share of female vote Major party faring better among women 2012 Obama 55 Romney 44 Dem +11 2008 Obama 56 McCain 43 Dem +13 2004 Kerry 51 Bush 48 Dem +3 2000 Gore 54 Bush 43 Nader 2 Dem +11 1996 Clinton 54 Dole 38 Perot 7 Dem +16 1992 Clinton 45 Bush 37 Perot 17 Dem +8 1988 Dukakis 49 Bush 50 GOP +1 1984 Mondale 44 Reagan 56 GOP +12 1980 Carter 45 Reagan 46 Anderson 7 GOP +1 So, Clinton’s 19-point average lead over Trump among women -- if it held all the way to November -- would give her the biggest winning margin among women of any presidential candidate since at least 1980. Finally, it’s worth noting that Clinton is not universally beloved by women -- but her ratings are a whole lot better than Trump’s. In April’s GWU/Battleground poll, for instance, Clinton scored a 51 percent favorable rating among women, with 47 percent unfavorable. By contrast, Trump’s rating among women in the same poll was 26 percent favorable, 71 percent unfavorable. The flip side is that Clinton does under-perform among men; the GWU/Battleground poll found that views of Clinton among men are 33 percent favorable, 66 percent unfavorable. Karlyn Bowman, a poll analyst for the American Enterprise Institute, considers this ""a big problem for her."" But the silver lining, she added, is that ""if past elections are a guide, more women will vote than men – probably about 53 to 54 percent."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn’t do very well with women."" The evidence he used to support this claim during the CNN interview -- his large margins among women in recent GOP primaries -- is undeniable, but says nothing about how well Clinton does among women. In fact, looking at a cross-section of April polls, Clinton’s average lead over Trump among female voters is bigger than any nominee has registered in an actual presidential election election in at least 36 years.

Forbes says China's submarine fleet will double United States' in a decade
","U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes says the Navy’s periscope is focusing far across the Pacific Ocean. ""They’re seeing the Chinese, that they’re going to have twice the number of submarines we have in just over a decade,"" Forbes, R-4th, said during a recent interview on ""The John Fredericks Show,"" a Portsmouth-based radio program broadcast across Virginia. Forbes long has called for strengthening the military. He’s chairman of the 21-member House Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, which oversees the Navy and Marine Corps. The Fourth Congressional District, which he has represented since 2001, has its population center in Chesapeake and Suffolk and relies on defense spending that supports the world’s largest naval base in Norfolk and nearby shipbuilding. This year, Forbes is seeking election in the Second Congressional District, which is centered in Virginia Beach and also is home to naval installations. Forbes made the switch after court-ordered changes to his old district made it friendly to Democrats. He faces a June 14 Republican primary challenge from Del. Scott Taylor, a former Navy seal, and Pat Cardwell, a Virginia Beach attorney. We wondered if Forbes is correct in saying that China’s submarine fleet will double that of the U.S. in slightly more than a decade. Hailey Sadler, the congressman’s communications director, pointed us to a series of reports about the U.S. and Chinese submarine fleets. The U.S. submarine fleet Sadler cited a March 17 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It contains a table showing that in 2026, the U.S. submarine fleet is projected to have 47 general purpose boats - 45 attack subs and another two cruise missile subs. That chart is the latest update of the Navy’s projected 30-year shipbuilding plan. But the 47-sub estimate is a low figure, because it doesn’t count 14 ballistic missile submarines that can launch nuclear warheads. With those boats counted, the U.S. Navy projects it will have 61 subs in 10 years. After that, the total number of subs is expected to drop to 58 in 2027; 55 in 2028; and 53 in 2029 and in 2030. Then, the size of the submarine fleet is expected rise again through most of the 2030s and beyond. China’s submarine fleet China is guarded about its military numbers, making it hard for analysts to quantify its submarine fleet. While Congress publicly debates the U.S. military budget every year, China decides its defense spending behind closed doors, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, there are some estimates about the size of China’s submarine fleet now and into the near future. Sadler said Forbes was referring to 2015 comments by James Fanell, a retired U.S. Navy captain. An article in Defense News quoted Fanell as saying that during the next 15 years, China’s submarine fleet would expand to 99 vessels. It should be noted that Fannell, a year earlier, was fired from his post as the Pacific Fleet’s director of intelligence and information for making unauthorized statements accusing China of preparing for a possible attack on Japan. Forbes’ office also pointed to estimates of China’s submarine fleet that appeared in a second Congressional Research Service report released in March. The research service noted that an analysis by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence shows that China’s total submarine fleet -- mostly attack boats and a handful of ballistic missile subs - was 66 to 75 in 2015. In 2020, it’s expected to be 69 to 78 submarines. If that growth rate of three more subs over a five-year period was to continue till 2026, then China would have about 72 to 81 submarines that year, Sadler said. The Department of Defense, meanwhile, has said that by 2020, China’s submarine force would grow to 69 to 78 submarines. Forbes’ office focuses on the high-side estimate of 81 extrapolated from Congressional Research Service figures and the 99-sub estimate that Fanell cited. ""The U.S. Navy projects it will have 47 submarines. Twice that is 94 - which is the middle ground between the figures projected by the Congressional Research Service and the Pacific Fleet’s former chief intelligence officer, rendering Congressman Forbes’ assessment an accurate projection,"" Sadler said. As we noted previously, the 47-submarine figure for the U.S. doesn’t take into account ballistic missile subs - which are included in the projections of China’s strength that Forbes cited. By the late 2020s, the number of all U.S. submarines would drop to 53, and if you double that figure it would outpace slightly the high-side estimate of 99 submarines Fanell cited. But other projections in the Congressional Research Service report show China’s submarine force could be lower than that about 10 years from now. We ran Forbes’ statement by Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based think tank that examines national security and defense spending issues. Clark estimated that between 2025 and 2030, China will have 80 to 100 submarines. With the U.S. having more than 50 submarines at that time, Forbes’ numbers have validity, Clark said. Beyond the numbers But we need to consider more than numbers when comparing the two nations’ submarine fleets, Clark added. He noted all U.S. subs are nuclear-powered, while China’s fleet, in a decade, still will contain many diesel-powered vessels. ""It is notable, however, that all of the U.S. submarines are highly capable of long endurance, whereas about half of China’s submarine fleet will be non-nuclear submarines best suited for regional operations close to home,"" Clark wrote in an email. Harrison, the analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us that nuclear subs can stay submerged for months, while diesel subs have to surface periodically to recharge their batteries. One of the Congressional Research Service reports that Forbes cites cautions against using ship numbers to compare the naval strength of nations. ""The potential for obscuring differences in the capabilities of ships of a given type is particularly significant in assessing relative U.S. and Chinese capabilities, in part because China’s navy includes significant numbers of older, obsolescent ships,"" the Congressional Research Service wrote. ""Figures on total numbers of Chinese submarines, destroyers, frigates, and coastal patrol craft lump older, obsolescent ships together with more modern and more capable designs."" On the other hand, the report notes that the U.S. Navy has global responsibilities and that many ships are based in on the Atlantic coast, meaning the American fleet would be strained to respond to a conflict near China. Our ruling Forbes said that in just over a decade, China will have twice the number of submarines as the U.S. The congressman has a point in that, in sheer numbers of subs, China’s fleet is expected to increase during the next 14 years as the U.S. submarine force is scheduled to decline. China is close-mouthed about its military plans, and the U.S. doesn’t know exactly how many subs that nation will have in 10 years or more. Defense analysts have made projections that vary between 80 and 100 Chinese subs. Forbes relies on the very highest of these wide-ranging projections to state as fact that China will double the U.S. fleet. We should point out that even if China built up to 100 subs by 2030, it still would not quite double the 53-submarine fleet the U.S. Navy has planned for that year. Forbes’ statement also glosses over major differences between the nations’ subs. The U.S. fleet is entirely nuclear-powered and capable of long underwater deployments far from home. Most of the Chinese fleet, in a decade, still will be diesel-powered and designed for relatively shorter assignments in regional waters. So Forbes’ statement contains has some accuracy but leaves out important details.

Missouri state senator half-right on pay for state's workers
","Following a Missouri Senate Budget Committee hearing about Medicaid coverage, Sen. Kiki Curls claimed on April 4 that Missouri ""is the state with the lowest paid workers."" We decided to see how Missouri's workers compare to the rest of the country. Curls' office didn't respond to our requests for the background information behind her claim. We see three ways to read her words. She might be talking about all workers, just private sector workers, or possibly, just state government workers. We examined all three. All Workers The latest numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show the average weekly wage for all workers in Missouri is $846. This number places Missouri 31st and well above the state with the lowest paid workers, Mississippi, where workers make an average weekly wage of $706. Private Sector BLS reports show that in Missouri the average weekly wage in the private sector is $851. The national average is $965 per week. This ranks Missouri in the bottom half of all states, but far from having ""the lowest paid workers."" Public Sector The BLS also reports the average weekly wages for state workers. In the third quarter of 2015, Missouri's state government employees made an average weekly wage of $803. This puts Missouri dead last of all the states. The national average weekly wage is $1,083 for state government employees, more than $200 over Missouri's average. Our Ruling Sen.

Yes, John Kasich is bragging about being unpopular
","Gov. John Kasich has been repeating an odd talking point lately: He keeps saying how unpopular he was as governor. The Ohio leader and presidential candidate said it in a Republican debate on March 30. On April 24, he repeated it on CBS Face the Nation when host John Dickerson asked if he thought it was possible for a candidate to change negative perceptions about him. ""After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country,"" Kasich said. ""It takes a long time to change negatives. People have to see that you're actually being fruitful in your work. What happened with me is when people started getting work, and we started balancing budgets and reaching out to people, it changed."" Is he right about being the least beloved state leader across the land after his first year in office? An August 2011 poll by Public Policy Polling said that with a 36 percent approval rating, he was the second or third least popular governor in the country. That was at least a few points better than in March 2011, when the same pollsters found Kasich’s approval ratings in the basement at 30 percent, and in May 2011 at 33 percent. Where was the love? In April 2011, his third month in office, Kasich made boatloads of enemies with a stroke of his pen. Kasich signed a massive union reform bill that prohibited forced union membership for state employees, mandated merit pay, outlawed strikes and limited collective bargaining rights for public employees. Unlike a similar reform bill in Wisconsin, Ohio’s SB 5 included police and firefighters. The political backlash was immediate, and a repeal effort quickly coalesced and reversed Kasich’s attempt at reform. Vying for the title of most unpopular governor in 2011 was Florida’s Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Public Policy Polling found that Kasich edged out Scott for most unfavorable governor in September 2011 with a 53 percent disapproval rating, compared to Scott’s 52 percent. But Kasich said he was (maybe) the country’s most unpopular governor after his first year. If he took office in January 2011, then we’d need to know his approval rating for the first few months of 2012. PolitiFact’s Louis Jacobson looked at the cast of rookie governors in February 2012, one year into their terms, for Governing magazine. Kasich made Jacobson’s list of the seven rookie governors who were struggling the most. Here they are, by approval rating: Jerry Brown (D-CA): 47 percent Rick Scott (R-FL): 43 percent Neil Abercrombie (D-HI): 39 percent Scott Walker (R-WI): 38 percent Nikki Haley (R-SC): 35 percent John Kasich (R-OH): 33 percent Lincoln Chafee (I -RI): 22 percent Based on these numbers, Kasich is the second-most unpopular governor after his first year. But Jacobson’s analysis only counted the 26 governors who took office at the start of 2011. Jacobson notes that approval ratings for governors aren’t exactly the holy grail of polling. He had to consult a handful of different polling groups for his comparison. Peter A. Brown, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, concurred. ""Nobody’s done every governor in the country,"" he said. ""There’s no reason to."" He said Quinnipiac only polls from nine states. ""What you can say is that it’s not possible to determine (whether Kasich was the least popular governor in the country),"" Brown said. ""But in a general sense, he’s probably right. He was certainly close to the bottom."" Rob Nichols, Kasich’s presidential campaign spokesman who was also the spokesman for the governor’s office in 2011, told us, ""Well yeah, we had just come from the election with $10 million in negative attack ads against us. So the last thing you saw was all this TV, trashing him."" Nichols also gave us this anecdote: In August 2011, his official email inbox was bombarded with form letters that started out, ""Dear Gov. Kasich staff member, I wanted Gov. Kasich to know that I voted for him in the Worst Governor Ever contest at www.worstgovernorever.com...."" ""I got so many that I had to get our IT people to route them to a special mailbox so they wouldn’t destroy my inbox,"" Nichols said.   Ohioans started to warm to Kasich after the turbulent first year. Later in 2012, his rating bumped up to the 40s, and was up to 53 percent approval in 2013. Quinnipiac University had Kasich polling at 62 percent favorability in October 2015. Our ruling Kasich said, ""After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country."" At its lowest, in March 2011, his favorability among the Ohioans who had just elected him was an abysmal 30 percent. That was bad enough to crown Kasich as the least-popular governor in America for a brief period.  We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2016/may/02/john-kasich/yes-john-kasich-bragging-about-being-unpopular/

Youngkin shifts position on abolishing Virginia's income tax
","Has Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin changed his position on axing Virginia’s personal income tax? A central theme in his campaign is that more people are moving out of Virginia than coming in, and a large reason, he says, is because taxes are too high.  While seeking the GOP nomination this spring, Youngkin said he was working on a plan to cut or eliminate the state income tax. He said his key fiscal adviser is Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who shaped tax cuts in Kansas in 2012 that were blamed for causing years of deep budget shortfalls until they were repealed in 2017. ""We are absolutely focused on not just getting our income tax down, but how we can, in fact, eliminate it,"" Youngkin said during an April 26 interview with conservative radio host Larry O’Connor. On April 12, he told conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitt, ""We have to get our taxes down. As your governor, I’m going to work like crazy to get them down. I’ve got a great senior economic adviser; Stephen Moore is working with us in order to figure out how to get our taxes down. And we’re targeting on getting them down to zero because we need to compete (with other states)."" Since winning the GOP nomination in May, Youngkin’s talk about ending income taxes has become problematic. The tax has a top rate of 5.75% on earnings above $17,500. It’s expected to generate $16 billion this budget year, or 67% of Virginia’s $23.9 billion general fund that pays for public safety, education and health programs. McAuliffe has said Youngkin’s abolition of sales tax would bring huge cuts to vital programs. Several newspapers have run editorials coming to the same conclusion and criticizing Youngkin for not saying how he would replace the lost revenues. ""If Virginians want to see an economy run ‘into the ditch,’ Mr. Youngkin’s plan would do the trick,"" The Washington Post wrote in a July 31 editorial. Youngkin’s tone has recently changed. ""I don’t believe we can eliminate Virginia’s state income tax,"" he told WMAL radio in Washington on Aug. 4. Youngkin said he is still committed to cutting the income tax and that, while he had set a goal of ending it, he never promised to do so. ""What I said was we, in fact, need to reduce our state income tax,"" Youngkin said. ""It would be aspirational to get rid of it, but it’s very hard to get rid of it and therefore we need to bring it down to make it more competitive."" Youngkin made similar remarks during an Aug.10 interview with WLNI in Lynchburg. ""In Virginia, we can’t get rid of income tax but we sure can try to bring it down,'' he said. ""It’s an important part of funding our government. It can’t go down to zero like Tennessee and Florida, but we can certainly bring it down and that’s one of the things I’m really focused on when I go to work for all Virginians as the next governor."" We asked Youngkin’s campaign for more explanation and were told his radio comments speak for themselves. Seeking the GOP nomination in April, Youngkin said he was focused ""on not just getting our income tax down, but how we can, in fact, eliminate it."" Although that may have stirred some Republicans, Youngkin stopped short of saying he would abolish the tax. He said he was looking into it with a conservative economist. Four months later, Youngkin says he still wants to cut the income tax but has determined it’s infeasible to eliminate it. That’s a significant change in position, but he left himself some leeway.

No, a Liz Cheney amendment didn't block Afghanistan troop drawdown
","The rapid fall of the Afghan government has prompted predictably partisan finger-pointing throughout Washington, as well as an unusual amount of intraparty blame. One example of the latter is the criticism lobbed by Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, against fellow Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who was already in the doghouse in her party for supporting President Donald Trump’s impeachment and an investigation of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.  In an interview with Breitbart on Aug. 17, Davidson said that as president, Trump ""was blocked from getting troops out of (Afghanistan) by Liz Cheney and others."" Davidson’s office told PolitiFact that he was referring to an amendment backed by Cheney and Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado in 2020 that he said impeded Trump’s efforts to end the war earlier and more safely. The amendment required that, before reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan below specified levels, the executive branch needed to issue a report documenting that the troop reduction would not harm national security. A slightly modified version became law in 2020 as part of a much broader defense authorization bill. However, the amendment did not ""block"" a military drawdown, in its design or its effect. Service members await a surprise Thanksgiving Day visit from President Donald Trump at Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan on Nov. 28, 2019. (AP) Trump negotiated a February 2020 agreement with the Taliban that paved the way for the U.S. withdrawal completed under President Joe Biden. Crow’s amendment didn’t block getting troops out of Afghanistan. But it did impose some noteworthy hurdles for the government to clear before it could reduce troop levels below certain thresholds. Under the original amendment language, the U.S. government could not access funding to draw down troops until the U.S. certified that no harm would come to counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan; that it wouldn’t pose risks to U.S. personnel; that allies would be consulted; and that the drawdown was in the United States’ best interests. The restrictions would be triggered if the administration wanted to reduce troop levels in Afghanistan below 8,000 and again if they fell below 5,000. The amendment also allowed the defense secretary, in consultation with other military leaders, to waive these requirements through an explanation to Congress if there was ""an imminent and extraordinary threat"" to U.S. troops and to ""the national-security interests of the United States."" The amendment was tweaked before its enactment as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. In the final version, the troop thresholds were reset to 4,000 and 2,000. Both the amendment and the broader legislation that ultimately contained it received wide bipartisan support. The amendment passed the House Armed Services Committee by a 45-11 vote, including 17-8 support from Republicans. The committee unanimously passed the full bill that included the amendment, 56-0. The House passed the final version of the authorization bill 335-78, with Republicans supporting it by a 140-40 margin. Then, after Trump vetoed the bill — over issues unrelated to Afghanistan — 109 House Republicans joined a successful vote to override the veto. While the amendment became law, the Trump administration effectively flouted it when it carried out its troop reduction. There’s no indication that the administration ever submitted the appropriate reports before drawing down troops below the amendment’s specified levels. Yet the Trump administration at least went below the 4,000 level and was aiming to leave the Biden administration with 2,500 personnel in Afghanistan. Davidson’s office told PolitiFact that even if the amendment didn’t ""block"" Trump from drawing down troop levels, it still used significant leverage by tying funding for a withdrawal to the reporting requirements. ""The power of the purse is almost all the muscle that Congress has left,"" said Christine Ravold, Davidson's communications director. Ravold added that Trump’s defiance of the amendment shouldn’t be used to argue that it didn’t pose a significant obstacle to troop withdrawal. ""It’s another example of the executive branch acting unilaterally without consulting Congress,"" she said. ""This won’t be the first or last time that Congress’s war powers are trampled by the White House."" Davidson said that Trump ""was blocked from getting troops out of (Afghanistan) by Liz Cheney and others."" ""Blocked"" is too strong a term for what the amendment was designed to do, since it allowed troop reductions to proceed as long as reports were submitted confirming the safety of U.S. forces and the protection of national security. Moreover, Trump ignored the law: He did not produce a report as the amendment required when he began reducing troop levels. Still, the amendment laid out robust terms before a drawdown could proceed, setting a national security requirement, and imposing terms on funding.

Conservative influencers wrongly claim Capitol bomb threat was ‘false flag’
","Soon after police negotiated the surrender of a North Carolina man who said he had a bomb in his truck outside the U.S. Capitol, conservative influencers on social media baselessly claimed that the standoff was a staged false flag event designed to make Republicans look bad. The suspect, Floyd Ray Roseberry, appeared in federal court Aug. 20, one day after he drove his truck onto the sidewalk outside the Library of Congress. He was charged with threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction and explosives, according to court documents. The charges undercut the ""false flag"" claims that trended on Twitter and spread to Facebook and Instagram, where they were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Among the claims: ""They weren’t creative with this false flag."" ""We barely survived another hillbilly insurrection today.

""This is a false flag distraction to further demonize American Patriots because everyone knows that Joe Biden is done!! This guy is a paid actor."" A false flag is an event in which the identity of the perpetrator is deliberately misrepresented so as to implicate another person or group. False flag conspiracy theories often spread after mass shootings and other major attacks, such as the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.   Several conservative influencers and social media users baselessly claimed the Capitol bomb threat was a ""false flag."" There’s no evidence that the Capitol bomb threat was a false flag, that it was staged, or that the suspect was actually an FBI agent, as some online rumors alleged. Roseberry confirmed his identity to investigators after his arrest, an FBI agent wrote in the affidavit. ""It was very much a real investigation,"" the Capitol Police told PolitiFact in a statement. Roseberry traveled to Washington after telling his wife he was going fishing. He parked his truck, a black Chevrolet pick-up with no license plates, near the Capitol. Photos and video footage from the day depicted the scene as he engaged with and surrendered to police. From his truck, Roseberry broadcast a live video to Facebook. He claimed to have explosives and demanded to speak with President Joe Biden. Facebook later removed the video and took down accounts associated with Roseberry from Facebook and Instagram, a spokesperson said. Also in the video, Roseberry said that the 2020 election was stolen, called himself a ""patriot,"" and stated that the ""revolution starts today"" — comments that reflected the beliefs of many of the pro-Trump rioters who are now facing charges after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6.  Records that Facebook provided to the FBI showed that Roseberry was the subscriber behind the account, the affidavit says. A witness who had reported concerns to local law enforcement about Roseberry’s views and intentions to commit violence also confirmed that the account was Roseberry’s, that Roseberry owned the black truck, and Roseberry was the man in the truck. Similarly, the Washington Post spoke to people who know Roseberry, including his ex-wife, who described her shock at seeing his face on social media. She said she had received calls all day from friends and family who were expressing the same disbelief.  Congressional staffers and Washington residents who were at or near the Capitol as the threat unfolded also spoke to the Post. None indicated that the event, which prompted evacuations, was or seemed to them like a false flag. Mark Fenster, professor of law at the University of Florida and the author of a book about conspiracy theories, said false flag claims are ""an especially powerful version of how conspiracy theories try to instruct people that what they see, are told, and believe are wrong.""  ""A false flag claim turns what seems on its face to be an event that is easily explicable — the Capitol riot was conducted by far-right supporters of President Trump — into its opposite,"" Fenster said. He said such claims have been around for a long time, bolstered by the fact that some actual ""false flag"" operations have occurred or been planned in the past. Tweets and other social media posts claimed that the Capitol bomb threat was a false flag. There’s no evidence that the standoff that forced evacuations from the Capitol was a false flag.  There’s lots of evidence it was not, including photos, videos, witness statements, and court filings that lay out the charges against Roseberry and say he confirmed his identity to the FBI.

Joe Biden said that al-Qaida is 'gone' from Afghanistan. That’s wrong
","As President Joe Biden defended his administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, he suggested that al-Qaida was no longer a threat there. ""Look, let’s put this thing in perspective here,"" Biden said in Aug. 20 remarks. ""What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with al-Qaida gone? We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of al-Qaida in Afghanistan, as well as getting Osama bin Laden. And we did."" Biden is wrong to say that al-Qaida is gone entirely; officials in his administration have said the terrorist group remains active.  On the same day of Biden’s remarks, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said: ""We know that al-Qaida is a presence, as well as ISIS, in Afghanistan and we've talked about that for quite some time. We do not believe it is exorbitantly high but we don't have an exact figure for you."" Kirby added that al-Qaida’s presence isn’t enough to merit a threat to the U.S. as it did 20 years ago.  On Fox News Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed that, saying that there are al-Qaida members in Afghanistan, but their capacity for a 9/11 type of attack has been diminished. Biden’s statement that al-Qaida is ""gone"" lacked that nuance and went further than his statement days earlier that al-Qaida in Afghanistan was ""degraded."" A White House spokesperson pointed to comments Biden made on Aug. 20 stating the threat of terrorism broadly, and al-Qaida specifically, remains a concern. Biden said that there was ""a greater danger from ISIS and al-Qaida and all these affiliates in other countries, by far, than there is from Afghanistan."" Reports by government agencies in recent months show that al-Qaida remains a presence in Afghanistan. A United Nations report in June stated that a significant part of the leadership of al-Qaida resides in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border region. Al-Qaida is present in at least 15 Afghan provinces and ""is reported to number in the range of several dozen to 500 persons,"" the report stated. While al-Qaida maintains contact with the Taliban, it is laying low, and it’s longer term strategy is ""strategic patience for a period of time before it would seek to plan attacks against international targets again,"" the report stated. The Inspector General to Congress compiled information from various federal agencies about operations in Afghanistan and released the information in a report this summer. The Defense Intelligence Agency told the Inspector General that the Taliban ""maintains a relationship with al-Qaida, providing safe haven for the terrorist group while publicly denying its presence in Afghanistan."" Under a February 2020 agreement between the Taliban and the United States, the Taliban was supposed to prevent al-Qaida from using Afghanistan to threaten the U.S. Therefore, the Taliban is likely downplaying its relationship with the group.    Tricia Bacon, an associate professor who directs the Policy Anti-Terrorism Hub at American University, said while al-Qaida has been seriously degraded, it has also received a morale boost from the Taliban’s victory. The group in Afghanistan ""is seriously weakened, but it has proven to be a resilient organization, capable of surviving despite immense counterterrorism pressure and of recovering from setbacks,"" Bacon said. Following the recent statements by Biden and administration officials, a Taliban spokesperson said in an interview with Saudi Arabia’s al-Hadath TV that al-Qaida is ""not present in Afghanistan in the first place,"" according to the Washington Post. But the spokesperson said  there may be ""family ties'' between members of the two organizations. Bacon said that the Taliban is being disingenuous and the statement does not ""accurately reflect the situation on the ground."" Laura Dugan, a professor of human security at Ohio State University, said Biden is correct in that the U.S. drove al-Qaida out of Afghanistan years ago and greatly diminished its centralized power.  ""This was especially true after Osama bin Laden was killed. However, what is also true is that al-Qaida and the Taliban are closely aligned, and with the Taliban back in charge of Afghanistan, al-Qaida can move around more freely, which means that they can more easily plan large scale attacks,"" Dugan said. Biden said that al-Qaida is ""gone"" from Afghanistan. Biden’s statement is wrong. On the same day, a Pentagon spokesperson said al-Qaida is present in Afghanistan, but that it wasn’t as powerful as it was 20 years ago. Recent reports from the federal government and the U.N., as well as comments from government officials in recent months, indicate that al-Qaida is still present in Afghanistan. Its future capabilities remain unclear.

Twitter hasn’t suspended Afghanistan’s president, but they have suspended two other accounts
","As the Taliban consolidates control over Afghanistan, the debate over whether its accounts should be allowed on social media platforms has intensified. ""BREAKING: Twitter has suspended the account of Afghanistan’s elected President… And have allowed the Taliban to keep their accounts. Can’t make this up,"" reads the text of an Aug. 19 Instagram post. The Instagram post is a screenshot of a tweet by conservative activist Ryan Fournier. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the wake of the U.S. military’s withdrawal, the Taliban has beaten back the Afghan government as the two fight for power over the country. As the situation unfolded, a new Afghan president rose to power, and Twitter suspended two government accounts. Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani fled to the United Arab Emirates as the Taliban closed in on Kabul on Aug. 15, according to CNN. Two days later, Afghanistan’s First Vice President ​​Amrullah Saleh declared himself the ""caretaker,"" or acting, president. ""As per the constitution of Afghanistan, in absence, escape, resignation or death of the President the FVP (First Vice President) becomes the caretaker President,"" Saleh tweeted on Aug. 17. While Afghanistan’s Constitution does not include ""escape"" or ""caretaker"" in the English translation, Article 60 allows the first vice president to become president under these circumstances. The Twitter account Saleh used to tweet this is not suspended as of this writing, and neither is Ghani’s. However, there are two other accounts affiliated with Afghanistan’s president and Saleh’s political party that Twitter has suspended. Twitter suspended the accounts @Afghpresident and @AfgGreenTrend as of Aug. 23. In an email with PolitiFact, a spokesperson from Twitter said, ""We’re proactively monitoring accounts affiliated with government organizations, and we may temporarily suspend accounts pending additional information from the account holder that allows us to confirm their identity."" Both of these accounts seem to be legitimate. For example, the Associated Press called @Afghpresident the ""de facto official presidential account"" of Afghanistan in its reporting on the suspension. The Afghanistan Green Trend party used @AfgGreenTrend to update the public following an attack that injured Saleh and killed at least two others in 2019. The Instagram post implies that Twitter suspended these accounts to legitimize the Taliban as the rulers of Afghanistan, but there is no evidence of this. There is also no evidence that Twitter suspended the accounts to retaliate against Saleh, as some users and outlets have suggested, since Saleh’s account where he declared himself president is still active. As for the Taliban’s accounts, representatives from Facebook and YouTube told the New York Times that they consider the Taliban a terrorist organization and forbid the group from operating on their platforms. However, Twitter has taken a different route when dealing with accounts linked to the Taliban. The Taliban isn’t banned from Twitter, but Twitter’s spokesperson told us they would take action against any content that violates their policies on glorifying violence, abusive behavior, hateful conduct, wishes of harm and gratuitous gore. One Taliban spokesperson, Suhail Shaheen, has over 390,000 followers and recently tweeted that the group welcomes Afghans who have previously worked with the U.S. or the Afghan government’s administration. The Taliban has promised this before, but some Afghans believe they will be executed if the Taliban finds out about their previous work. As the situation in Afghanistan continues to evolve, we’ll have to see whether Twitter will continue to allow the Taliban on their platform or if their accounts break the website’s rules. According to the Washington Post, the Taliban has been careful to avoid suspension as they use social media to spread propaganda and present an image different from when they were last in power.  Meanwhile, some on Twitter have asked why the Taliban is permitted on Twitter while former President Donald Trump is not. Twitter permanently suspended Trump for tweets he sent after the riot at the Capitol. An Instagram post claimed that ""Twitter has suspended the account of Afghanistan’s elected President and have allowed the Taliban to keep their accounts."" Twitter has not suspended the accounts of either acting president Amrullah Saleh or his predecessor Ashraf Ghani.
The two Twitter accounts @Afghpresident and @AfgGreenTrend are currently suspended. Twitter likely suspended the accounts pending verification of who controls them. Taliban spokespeople have active accounts on Twitter, but they have not broken any of Twitter's rules and are still allowed on the platform.

Other versions that were being re-shared in light of the August 2021 withdrawal were posted to Facebook as early as 2012. On Aug. 6, 2011, a Taliban fighter shot down a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter, killing all 38 people aboard — 30 U.S. special operation troops, along with eight Afghan nationals. Early reports said the number was 31. The incident is sometimes referred to as Extortion 17, the call sign for the helicopter. Of the 30, 17 were Navy SEALs, including some in the unit that carried out the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. (Officials said none involved in the raid died in the helicopter attack.)  A few days later, the U.S. announced that international forces had killed the Taliban insurgents who were responsible for the attack. A U.S. military investigation later concluded that the Taliban fighters had used a rocket-propelled grenade.

U.S. is importing large amount of Russian oil, but Facebook post misstates Keystone XL role
","On social media, Americans are frustrated with rising gasoline prices. Online critics of President Joe Biden have blamed him personally for the price spike, though experts have told us that the price increase has more to do with higher demand during the economic recovery following the business shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.  One recent Facebook post merged this line of argument with another criticism: The Biden was coddling Russia with his energy policies. The post said, ""The imbecile in chief is now importing 800,000 barrels of oil from Russia. Guess how much oil the (Keystone XL pipeline) would have carried from Canada? I will give you a hint. It rhymes with 800,000 barrels."" After years of acrimony, Biden used the power of the executive branch to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported crude oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. From there, refined petroleum products could be sold either in the U.S. or to foreign buyers.   Oil experts say the post draws a misleading relationship between Russian imports and the Keystone pipeline project. The most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that in May, the U.S. imported 844,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia. That’s almost 10% of all the U.S. imports for that month. Historically speaking, this is a large amount, setting a new monthly record for Russian oil imports.  A large reason for the spike in Russian imports is believed to be sanctions the U.S. placed on Venezuela in 2019. Much of what the United States has been importing from Russia is a gooey, semi-refined fuel that the Russians call ""mazut"" that is similar to the Venezuelan product. Some U.S. plants have specialized systems to refine these fuels, and some oil companies have turned to Russia to keep those factories going in the absence of Venezuelan imports. As for the cancelled Keystone XL pipeline, it would have been able to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil every day. Experts said that any impact from the Keystone XL pipeline would have been years down the road. Even if all legal obstacles were to disappear, the project would have involved the construction of 1,204 miles of new pipeline in Canada and the United States. This means the pipeline wouldn’t have solved the immediate problem referred to in the Facebook post.  ""There is no justification for comparing oil import levels from Russia to the transportation capacity of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, or to suggest that these imports from Russia would have been entirely displaced by crude transported through Keystone XL,"" said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. In addition, ""the Keystone XL pipeline wouldn’t have produced oil — it would have transported oil,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business. In other words, just because Keystone XL might have been able to carry 800,000-plus barrels a day ""does not mean that production in Canada would have been 800,000 barrels a day higher than today,"" Bordoff said. The pipeline might have simply displaced other types of transportation, such as tanker trucks, that are currently used to carry oil away from Alberta. There’s no guarantee that oil producers in Alberta would have sold that theoretical excess production to the U.S. Finally, the United States produces much of its own oil and could produce more if needed. In 2020, the most recent full year, the U.S. exported 8.51 million barrels a day of petroleum and imported about 7.86 million, marking the first year since at least 1949 that the U.S. was a net annual petroleum exporter, according to the Energy Information Administration. That same year, the United States produced about 18.4 million barrels of petroleum per day, which is more than its daily consumption of 18.1 million barrels a day. A Facebook post said the U.S. is ""now importing 800,000 barrels of oil from Russia,"" but that this could have been prevented if the Keystone XL pipeline hadn’t been cancelled. The amount of oil being imported today from Russia has reached a record level of more than 800,000 barrels a day. That does roughly equal the transport capacity of the Keystone XL pipeline — but it’s not as simple as substituting one source for the other.  The pipeline would have required years of construction and likely more legal challenges, so it couldn’t have solved today’s demand needs. Even in the future, there would be no certainty that the pipeline could produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day, rather than just transporting oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way. Nor would producers be obligated to sell that entire amount to the U.S. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2021/aug/23/facebook-posts/us-importing-large-amount-russian-oil-facebook-pos/

No, Milwaukee election official didn’t admit to delivering just enough ballots for a Biden win
","Though the 2020 presidential election happened nearly 10 months ago, challenges to its results have not stopped.  In Wisconsin, former President Donald Trump and his supporters filed recount requests and election lawsuits but lost all of them. The state Supreme Court upheld Biden’s win and rejected Trump’s lawsuit in December 2020.   In February 2021, Republican lawmakers ordered an audit of the state’s elections through the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau.  Later, in July 2021, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, hired former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman to oversee another investigation into the election — even though  Gableman told Trump supporters last year that he thought the election had been stolen.  And, in August 2021, state Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, overseeing another partisan investigation, sent subpoenas to leaders of Brown and Milwaukee counties seeking ballots from the presidential election and the machines used to count them. Attorneys for the state Legislature have said Brandtjen does not have the power to do so.  Yet Trump is still falsely claiming that the election was stolen from him.  In an Aug. 12, 2021 email statement praising Brandtjen’s efforts, Trump wrote that Wisconsin ""shows many (to put it mildly) signs of cheating in the 2020 election, and people want answers, now.""  Later in the statement, he added: ""A Milwaukee election official even acknowledged dropping off just the margin of ballots needed for a Biden win at 3:00 AM.""  That incident has provided fuel for many claiming the election was stolen, but that’s not what happened.  Let’s take a look back.  Around 4 a.m. the morning after Election Day, an election consultant wrote to Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Elections Commission.  ""Damn, Claire, you have a flair for drama, delivering just the margin needed at 3:00 a.m."" the consultant wrote. ""I bet you had those votes counted at midnight, and just wanted to keep the world waiting!""  Woodall-Vogg responded about 10 minutes later.  ""Lol,"" she wrote. ""I just wanted to say I had been awake for a full 24 hours!""  The email exchange was published first by two right-wing websites that have focused on how the election was conducted. They have prompted numerous threats against Woodall-Vogg. She later told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel she read the email as a joking way to note the state’s results couldn’t be called until Milwaukee’s total came in. She called the email ""a very inappropriate joke"" but not evidence of an attempt to steer the election to Biden.  What’s more, it was expected that Milwaukee’s final tally of votes would come in the middle of the night because Wisconsin election officials aren’t allowed to start counting absentee ballots until Election Day, and there were many more of those ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Both Republican and Democratic observers were at Milwaukee’s absentee ballot-counting center until all results were tallied.  And there has been no evidence that ballots were deliberately miscounted. The process that night has stood up to both a recount requested byTrump and a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling.  Finally, in answering the email, Woodall-Vogg did not acknowledge what Trump claimed she has.  No election officials have said they threw the election. Trump claimed that a Milwaukee election official had acknowledged dropping off just the margin of ballots needed for a Biden win at 3 a.m.  Though Woodall-Vogg said she read the email she received from the election consultant as a joke, contrary to the Trump claim, she did not acknowledge doing what was claimed, nor has any election official acknowledged that they threw the election.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2021/aug/23/donald-trump/no-milwaukee-election-official-didnt-admit-deliver/

COVID-19 deaths of Broward County teachers did happen, despite claims otherwise
","CORRECTION, Sept. 1: We updated this article to remove the name of a former Broward County community member who died in early August. The woman was not a Broward teacher and had moved from the area, and her family said she died from other causes, not COVID-19. This does not affect the rating of the story. A CNN report on Aug. 13 stated that in a 24-hour span, four Broward County, Fla., schoolteachers had died from COVID-19 and at least three of them were unvaccinated.  The Broward Teachers Union later corrected the announcement that served as the basis of the report, saying it was three teachers and that the fourth person was actually a Broward County Public Schools graduate who interacted heavily with the school district due to the nature of their job. But an Instagram post sharing a clip from the CNN report questioned whether any of it was true. ""Ohhh look CNN is doing a story on (u)nvaccinated teachers who died of C0v1d in BROWARD COUNTY FL,"" the post said. ""But aren't the schools still closed there? At least until next week."" Commenters on the post called the report ""fake news."" That post has since been deleted, but we found similar claims that also called the CNN report into question. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The misspellings of words such as COVID and vaccine are common tactics to evade detection by fact-checkers. School hadn’t started when the teachers died. But the deaths did happen.  The three Broward school employees who died were Janice Wright, a teacher at Pinewood Elementary; Katina Jones, a Dillard Elementary teacher; and Yolanda Hudson Williams, a teacher’s assistant at Dillard. Each died within 24 hours of each other the week of Aug. 13. A fourth woman was identified by the teachers union, but she was a nonprofit worker who no longer lived in the area, and her family told PolitiFact on Sept. 1 that she died from other causes, not COVID-19, and in another state. The CNN report did not say that the four were infected at school, but it called attention to rising infection numbers locally that were causing concern about COVID-19 safety measures in schools. ""To say that we’re lying or faking deaths is just reckless and deplorable and a poor sense of human decency,"" said teacher union President Anna Fusco.  Broward County Public Schools did not respond to requests for comment. Schools opened Aug. 18. Fusco confirmed that Wright, Jones and Williams were not vaccinated. The women were Black and in their late 40s. According to data from Kaiser Family Foundation, vaccination rates for Black Floridians have been much lower than for white Floridians.   The Broward County School Board made headlines in early August when it defied Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ order barring schools from requiring masks. The board voted 8-1 to keep the existing mask mandate, even with DeSantis’ threats to sanction the school district. COVID-19 cases have been on the rise this summer in Florida, with daily cases and hospitalizations reaching their highest levels since the pandemic began. Florida’s Department of Health reported that there were more than 151,000 new cases during the week of Aug. 6. More than 40,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the state. An Instagram user implied that a CNN news report about teachers who died from COVID-19 was fake because the school year hadn’t started yet.  Broward County Public Schools reopened Aug. 18, a week after the post was made.

How do COVID-19 deaths, job losses in NC compare to other states?
","Gov. Roy Cooper says that, compared to other states, North Carolina has done an exceptional job of preventing job losses and COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic. His comments came during an Aug. 4 press conference after a state official offered an update on North Carolina’s rental assistance program. ""Thanks to you and your team for the hard work,"" he said. ""Several months ago, an analysis showed that in states across the country, North Carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest COVID-related deaths, as well as job losses per capita."" ""In a difficult year and amid too much pain, saving lives and jobs has been a point of pride for our state. It shows we follow the science to protect people’s lives without losing sight of their livelihoods."" Cooper was referring to an analysis by the research firm Hamilton Place Strategies, according to spokesman Ford Porter. The study, published in April, examined statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Labor to compare job losses and COVID-19 deaths in each state.  A chart accompanying the study shows North Carolina as one of only a few states where both death and job loss rates were well below the national average, though by the time Cooper spoke in August, those stats were a little outdated.  We wondered: How do North Carolina’s COVID-19 death and job loss numbers compare to other states as of August? It turns out that North Carolina’s numbers are still relatively low.  Data compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control shows the number of deaths in each state, as well as the rate of death per 100,000 people. To see what the data looked like on the day of Cooper’s press conference, we used the ""Wayback Machine"" at Archive.org.  On Aug. 4, the CDC’s most recent data was from Aug. 3. Here’s what it showed. Death rate: North Carolina had a lower death rate than the national average, which was 184 deaths per 100,000 people on Aug. 3 and its rate of 130 deaths per 100,000 people ranked 12th-lowest in the country on that date.  Only Idaho (123), Colorado (120), Nebraska (117), New Hampshire (102), Washington (80), Utah (76), Oregon (67), Maine (66), Alaska (52), Vermont (40) and Hawaii (37) had lower rates as of Aug. 3. As of Aug. 19, North Carolina’s rate was 133 deaths per 100,000 people, still the 12th-lowest in the country. David Wohl, a physician who studies infectious diseases at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, says it makes sense to judge a state’s responsiveness by looking at deaths per capita. He said low rates are influenced by a multitude of factors, from access to care to the general health of the population. ""NC does have a robust healthcare infrastructure with many local medical facilities and major regional tertiary care centers,"" Wohl told PolitiFact NC in an email.  ""Testing for COVID-19 has been widely available, leading to potential earlier diagnosis. The state has been very active in administering monoclonal antibody treatment and I suspect we are doing better at this than many other states, possibly preventing progression to more serious disease."" North Carolina’s unemployment rate is tracked by both the state’s commerce department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. North Carolina’s unemployment rate was 3.6% in February 2020, hit a pandemic high of 12.9% in April 2020, and fell to 4.4% in July. In July, 20 states had lower unemployment rates than North Carolina. When Cooper spoke on Aug. 4, the latest unemployment data available was from June. At that time, 21 states had lower unemployment rates than North Carolina.  But unemployment rates, which are based on household surveys, don’t alone provide a clear picture of each state’s employment level, says Michael Ettlinger, founding director of the University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy.  ""There are many otherwise employable people who want employment but who are not out actively looking for jobs because their industry hasn’t come back enough to make it worthwhile,"" Ettlinger said. ""With variations among states in people starting to seek jobs, differences in the unemployment rate between states can be as much because of those variations as actual job creation."" Ettlinger and Jordan Hensley, a policy analyst in his department, recently published a study that examined how many jobs each state lost and recovered during the pandemic. According to their study, North Carolina lost 2.7% of its jobs between February 2020 and June 2021, equal to about 124,000 positions. That percentage is tied for the 10th-lowest among the states, Ettlinger said.  Unemployment data released just hours before this fact check reinforce the idea that North Carolina’s economy is recovering faster than other states. The latest data show that North Carolina lost only 1% of its jobs between last February and this July, the sixth-lowest percentage in the country. A variety of factors might influence job gains, Ettlinger said. Weather, early COVID-19 rates, current COVID-19 rates, the type of businesses in each state, pre-existing employment trends, and ""a certain degree of randomness"" may all play a role in employment levels, he said. Mike Walden, an economist at N.C. State University, says the state may have benefitted from its mix of industries. ""Sectors like technology, financial services, and education — particularly higher education — largely continued operating. Also, agriculture and agribusiness were deemed necessary and continued their work,"" Walden told PolitiFact NC in an email.
Cooper appointed Walden to a business group that met with him virtually every two weeks. He said Cooper and others in state government ""worked with and listened to the business community for advice on managing both the economic and health issues of the pandemic."" Still, ""if I was asked prior to the pandemic if NC would have performed so relatively well, I would not have necessarily predicted these very positive results,"" he said. Cooper said ""North Carolina during this pandemic had among the lowest COVID-related deaths, as well as job losses per capita."" North Carolina was 12th from the bottom among states in the coronavirus death rate, and an analysis by the University of New Hampshire shows that North Carolina’s job losses during the pandemic were the 10th lowest among the states. These are not the absolute lowest rates nationally, but both measures can reasonably be described as being relatively low.

COVID-19 vaccination does not violate the Nuremberg Code
","A man calling himself the ""vaccine police"" posted a video on Facebook making unsubstantiated claims about COVID-19 vaccines and the people administering them at a Walmart pharmacy in Missouri. The video uploaded on Aug. 16 runs for more than 30 minutes and initially shows a man, identified as Christopher Key, driving up to a Walmart parking lot and filming himself inside his car. ""We are headed to Walmart, and we are going to present documents to the pharmacist, letting them know what they are doing is crimes against humanity and what they are doing is a violation of the Nuremberg Code, and if they do not stand down immediately, then they could be executed,"" he says. Later in the video, the man is joined by a few other supporters who join in filming themselves as they walk through the store and up to the pharmacy area, where employees are shuttering the service windows. The video shows Key confronting and threatening other Walmart employees. At some point, Key claims that he’s there to be vaccinated. Eventually, Key and his supporters leave the store, and police await them outside. No one appears to be arrested. The Washington Post reported that Key ""has a history of making discredited medical claims."" Key’s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Key’s claim that pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines are doing so in ""violation of the Nuremberg Code"" is false. The Nuremberg principles that Key alludes to are not part of U.S. law; they refer to a treaty agreed to after World War II to prosecute individuals for war crimes, and crimes against humanity, said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame School of Law. One of the principles is that humans should not be subject to medical experiments without their voluntary consent. O’Connell said that some individuals were charged under the charter with carrying out forced medical experimentation, and such forced experimentation is barred specifically in current treaties on the law of armed conflict, most notably the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977. Key’s argument is based on the false premise that COVID-19 vaccinations are medical experiments, O’Connell said. She noted that the COVID-19 vaccines were developed through testing by willing, volunteer participants, and when those clinical trials met the acceptable legal and ethical standards of safety and efficacy, the vaccines were given emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ""No one taking the vaccine is being subjected to experimentation,"" O’Connell said. ""Further, no one is forced to get a vaccine. If you refuse for reasons other than medical issues or religious teaching, you may lawfully be barred from certain activities where you may infect other people. That is your choice, not one coerced by the government."" Noah Feldman, a law professor at Harvard University and Bloomberg Opinion columnist, in June also wrote that vaccine mandates don’t violate the Nuremberg consent principle, because they are not experimental and because the Nuremberg code isn’t a federal or Texas law. His post was based on a Texas lawsuit challenging a hospital’s requirement that employees get vaccinated against COVID-19. ""But the fact that the code isn’t really law is unlikely to bring any comfort to vaccine skeptics. And the lack-of-consent point is not the point the plaintiffs are really trying to press, anyway. They want to promote the view that the vaccines are experimental,"" Feldman wrote. As PolitiFact has reported, while vaccine skeptics often use the term ""experimental agent"" when referring to the vaccines, the FDA refers to them as ""investigational vaccines."" The agency tells vaccine makers to file ""periodic safety reports at monthly intervals"" under an ""investigational new drug"" tracking system. The three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are being administered under emergency use authorization. During public health emergencies, like the coronavirus pandemic, the FDA has the legal power to grant emergency use authorization to certain products if they meet specific criteria and if there’s no adequate, approved and available alternative to treat the malady. A goal is to make products available quickly, when people urgently need them. Scientists and physicians at the FDA decide whether to grant such authorization. ""An emergency use authorization has a slightly lower bar to cross than full approval, but has come about after a comprehensive review of the data,"" Seema Shah, a Northwestern University professor of medical ethics previously told PolitiFact. Pfizer and BioNTech, which developed one of the three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S., in May completed their application for full FDA approval for use in people ages 16 and older. An FDA decision is expected by January. Moderna said in June that it had begun submitting parts of its full approval application. Johnson & Johnson has not yet submitted an application, but plans to this year, the company said. A Facebook post claims that COVID-19 vaccinations are ""a violation of the Nuremberg code."" One of the Nuremberg principles is that humans should not be subject to medical experiments without their voluntary consent. The vaccines have been tested in clinical trials with people who gave their consent. The post is also based on the premise that COVID-19 vaccinations are medical experiments and that’s not true, an expert told us.

The CDC’s not going to put people at high risk of catching COVID-19 into camps
","Conservative media commentator Candace Owens blasted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a tweet, saying that the agency published a document to discuss putting people in camps to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Owens drew attention to the document by tweeting, ""the CDC actually put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to ‘shield’ low risk people from them."" She continued, ""No — this is not a joke, and yes, every single person who has made a reference to 1930s Germany is vindicated.""  But Owens’ statement mischaracterized the purpose and findings of a CDC document that explored the merits and flaws in one method suggested as a means of stemming COVID-19 transmission in refugee camps and other humanitarian settings. By referencing 1930s Germany, Owens’ tweet gives the impression that the CDC proposed putting people into camps to mitigate the virus. It didn’t.  CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund put it straight — no, there are no camps being put into place to shield high risk people from low risk people, she said.  In a document titled ""Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings,"" which was last updated July 26, 2020 — a few months into the pandemic and months before vaccines became available —  the CDC sought to examine one idea for curbing COVID-19 transmission in places such as refugee camps.  The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s Health in Humanitarian Crises Centre in March of 2020 had published a paper about what it called the ""shielding approach"" as a means of reducing COVID-19 transmission and deaths in ""forcibly displaced populations residing in camps or camp-like settings"" such as refugee camps. The existing guidance at that point for reducing transmission among the general population involved ""mass ‘stay-at-home' orders, social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine"" — measures that the paper’s authors noted could be unfeasible or inappropriate in settings where already vulnerable populations are being cared for in group settings. In its own paper, the CDC sought to interpret and analyze scientific COVID-19 concepts and data, Norlund said. ""The purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC’s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data,"" the document said.  Under a shielding approach concept, high-risk individuals would have minimal contact with low-risk family members or residents. They would be moved to what was described as ""green zones."" In a household, that might constitute a separate room or area. In a neighborhood setting, it might be a designated shelter or house. And in a camp setting, it might be a group of shelters like schools or community buildings. The document highlighted several potential challenges with the approach, including that it could lead to stigmatization, isolation and separation from family members. ""While the premise is based on mitigation strategies used in the United Kingdom, there is no empirical evidence whether this approach will increase, decrease or have no effect on morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in various humanitarian settings,"" the document said. ""This document highlights: a) risks and challenges of implementing this approach, b) need for additional resources in areas with limited or reduced capacity, c) indefinite timeline, and d) possible short-term and long-term adverse consequences."" It continued: ""Public health not only focuses on the eradication of disease but addresses the entire spectrum of health and wellbeing. Populations displaced, due to natural disasters or war and conflict are already fragile and have experienced increased mental, physical and/or emotional trauma. While the shielding approach is not meant to be coercive, it may appear forced or be misunderstood in humanitarian settings.""  Owens tweeted that the CDC ""put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to ‘shield’ low risk people from them,"" and she likened it to ""1930s Germany."" The CDC did not recommend putting people who are at high-risk for COVID-19 into ""camps."" It published a document that explored a concept called ""shielding"" that researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s Health in Humanitarian Crises Centre explored as a means to contain COVID-19 spread among people who already live in settings such as refugee camps. The CDC’s analysis of the research highlighted several challenges with the concept and noted that there was ""no empirical evidence"" regarding whether it would even be effective at curbing COVID-19 deaths.

","A viral post on Reddit shows a dramatic photo of two people lying on the ground sick with COVID-19 seeking treatment. One appears curled against a wall, while another patient draped with a paper medical gown is curled up, face down. ""Everyone please be careful — whether you are vaccinated or not,"" wrote Suzanne Lopez on Reddit where she posted the photo taken by her husband Louie. ""My husband (vaccinated, but positive) has been waiting 2+ hours for monoclonal therapy and he says he has never seen people so sick. Moaning, crying, unable to move."" The Reddit thread drew hundreds of comments about the spread of COVID-19 in Florida, which has experienced a spike in cases this summer. ""I hate to see it, and I hate to say it, but we need more pictures like this showing the reality of the situation,"" wrote one Reddit user. The idea that, more than one year into the pandemic, COVID-19 patients in a major city in Florida would be lying on a floor moaning for help seemed improbable. But it’s real, according to city and state officials.  The photo was taken at one of multiple state-supported sites that opened in August to provide monoclonal antibody treatments that help COVID-19 patients avoid hospitalization or death. Nikki Kimbleton, a spokesperson for the city of Jacksonville, said in a written statement to PolitiFact that the volume of patients seeking the treatment more than doubled in recent days at the Jacksonville clinic, which is located at a public library. While the site provided 43 doses on Aug. 16, that rose in the following days to 97, 143 and 155.  Once the city realized the increase in patients seeking treatment, the city made sure the clinic had adequate supplies, including more wheelchairs, seats for patients waiting in line and signs directing patients to alert someone if they need assistance. Louie Lopez, who took the photo, told PolitiFact that he was vaccinated in the spring. But about a week ago he came down with symptoms of nasal congestion and a headache and then tested positive for COVID-19. Lopez said his physician advised him to take Regeneron, so he signed up for an appointment.  Lopez told PolitiFact he saw only a couple of chairs at the appointment site. He said that while he was waiting in line for his appointment, other people arrived including the two women in the photo.  He said the woman in the yellow dress ""was in the worst shape — she was moaning and in pain, and it was freezing in there. They brought one of those paper gowns and covered her up. She was just laying there,"" Lopez said. Lopez said he didn’t time the events precisely, but estimated the women were on the floor for about an hour. Later, clinic staff put the two women into wheelchairs.  City and state officials sent us a TV news report by News4Jax, which included an interview with Toma Dean, the woman lying face down on the floor. Dean, of Fleming Island, told News4Jax, that she was not vaccinated, and said that she had been suffering with COVID-19 and pneumonia for two weeks. An emergency room doctor had advised her to get the monoclonal antibody treatment.  Dean described herself as in ""very bad shape, light-headed, dizzy, shortness of breath. I couldn’t stand at all."" She told News4Jax that the staff at the library were excellent and scrambled to get wheelchairs. Dean’s voice in the TV interview showed she was still sick, but she said she felt better after the treatment. (PolitiFact was unable to reach Dean directly.) ""This is real, guys,"" Dean told News4Jax. ""If you have it, I advise you to go get this therapy. Go take advantage of the resources out there. Get vaccinated. It may not be the first thing that you want to do, but it's better than the end result."" In November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization to Tarrytown, N.Y.-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. for Regeneron to treat mild to moderate COVID-19. The product consists of two monoclonal antibodies, which are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. On Aug. 10, 2021, the FDA revised the authorization, allowing for emergency use of Regeneron as a preventive drug for people who are exposed to the virus and are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. The agency said the treatment is not a substitute for vaccination.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has urged people to take the drug, which was used by former President Donald Trump after he became infected. Both vaccines and Regeneron are free for Floridians.  The state of Florida has ordered more than 7,000 doses in total from the federal government, said Weesam Khoury, a state health department spokesperson. A photo shows two COVID-19 patients lying on the floor seeking treatment in Florida. City and state officials confirmed that the photo was taken at a state-supported site in Jacksonville where Floridians can get a free Regeneron treatment. The photo was taken by another patient as he waited in line for his appointment during a week that saw a rapid increase in patients showing up to receive treatment. More chairs and wheelchairs and signs have since been added at the site.  This image is real.

Claim wrong about Biden, Harris, Psaki being off of work amid Afghanistan crisis
","The day the Taliban declared the war over in Afghanistan, after swiftly seizing the country as U.S. troops departed, President Joe Biden’s administration was attacked on social media as having been off duty. ""Joe Biden is on a 2 week vacation. Kamala Harris has been nonexistent since Inauguration Day. Jen Psaki is taking a break from her duties as Press Secretary for one week,""  an Aug. 16 Instagram post that claimed. ""The country has questions, and there is nobody to answer them. This administration is a joke."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden had planned to take a two-week vacation, but interrupted it and cut it short. Harris has been active on several fronts, including Afghanistan. Psaki had planned to be on vacation, but reported to work. Here are the details, based on news reports and Factbase’s listing of Biden’s public schedule.  Biden went home to Delaware on the afternoon of Friday Aug. 6 for the weekend. He had planned to start a two-week vacation sometime during the week of Monday, Aug. 9.  But Biden returned to Washington for two days. He arrived at the White House late on the morning of Tuesday, Aug. 10; he and Harris gave remarks on the Senate’s passage of an infrastructure bill. He stayed until Thursday, Aug. 12, arriving home in Delaware late in the afternoon. On the afternoon of Friday, Aug. 13, Biden went from Delaware to Camp David. Biden interrupted his vacation on Monday, Aug. 16, the day the Taliban declared the war over, and arrived in Washington that afternoon. He gave a speech at the White House on the Afghanistan situation, then returned to Camp David. Biden ended his vacation when he returned to Washington on the night of Tuesday, Aug. 17. News reports said he cut his vacation short by one day. So, for the nine days from Monday, Aug. 9, through Tuesday, Aug. 17, during a period when Biden was expected to be on vacation, he was in Washington for all or part of five days — the 10th, 11th, 12th, 16th and 17th. He was not on vacation for two weeks. While in Delaware and at Camp David, Biden continued some duties, including receiving briefings, although some days, no public events were scheduled. Moreover, the White House staffers travel with the president while he is vacationing. Psaki had planned to take off the week of Monday Aug. 16, but returned to the White House that day.  The Los Angeles Times reported Aug. 18 that Harris ""has been, at least visually, front and center as President Biden has overseen America’s retreat from Afghanistan. She attends most of his security briefings and had to leave a meeting with business leaders Thursday afternoon to attend an urgent intelligence session as the Taliban rapidly cemented control over the country."" Harris has been active on other fronts. For example, in July, Harris released a strategy addressing root causes of migration; and in June, she began leading the administration's effort to bolster voting rights across the nation. Also in June, Harris took her first foreign trip as vice president, visiting Mexico and Guatemala to discuss strategy on stemming migration. On Aug. 16, the day the Taliban declared the war in Afghanistan over, an Instagram post claimed: ""Joe Biden is on a two-week vacation. Kamala Harris has been nonexistent since Inauguration Day. Jen Psaki is taking a break from her duties as press secretary for one week."" Biden had planned to take a two-week vacation starting sometime during the week of Aug. 9, but he interrupted the vacation to return twice to Washington, and then cut it short. Harris has been active, including with the Afghanistan crisis, and Psaki reported to work on Aug. 16, the first weekday that she was to have been on a one-week vacation.
