Donald Trump says 'he didn't say' the things about women that Megyn Kelly asked him about in debate
","Donald Trump maintained several times on the Sunday shows that he would not apologize for ""totally appropriate"" — yet widely criticized — comments about Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who questioned him during the first GOP presidential debate about the way he’s talked about women over the years. ""You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals,’ "" Kelly said. Trump cut her off with his index finger in the air, quipping it was ""only Rosie O’Donnell."" When the crowd’s roar settled, Kelly continued. ""Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women’s looks. You once told a contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice it would be a ‘pretty picture’ to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the 'war on women'?"" Trump, who owned up only to insulting comedian Rosie O’Donnell, disparaged Kelly after the debate — saying that she ""behaved very badly,"" that ""she had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,"" and sharing a Twitter post that referred to her as a ""bimbo"" — only inflaming debate about whether he is a misogynistic threat to the GOP. NBC host Chuck Todd tried to get Trump to understand why his comments are perceived as sexist, bringing up New York Times columnist Gail Collins and singer Bette Midler as two more examples of times he went after a woman’s ""looks."" ""Well, some of the things that she said, I didn't say, okay?"" Trump said of Kelly. ""And she went through a whole list. And this is a hell of a first question, by the way. But I will say this, I was attacked by the people that you talk about."" We decided to fact-check whether Kelly said things that Trump didn’t say and look at the context of some of his other arguments with high-profile women. A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign could not be reached for comment. ‘Fat pig,’ ‘slob’ and ‘animal’ Kelly said Trump had referred to women as ""fat pigs"" and ""slobs."" As he admitted during the debate, Trump has leveled both invectives at O’Donnell, the comedian and former panelist on The View. He rattled off the first in a Dec. 29, 2006, interview with Fox News while imagining how O’Donnell’s ex-wife Kelli might have explained the couple’s relationship to her parents. ""Can you imagine the parents of Kelli ... when she said, 'Mom, Dad, I just fell in love with a big, fat pig named Rosie?’ "" he said. Trump also referred to O’Donnell as an ""animal"" and a ""slob"" in 2006. So the insults clearly happened, apparently spurred by comments O’Donnell made on the Dec. 20, 2006, episode of The View. After Trump announced he would not fire a Miss USA winner who had been accused of drug use, underage drinking and ""sexual indiscretions,"" O’Donnell criticized Trump’s personal and professional dealings, pointing out that a few of Trump’s companies had gone bankrupt in the past and calling him a ""snake-oil salesman."" O’Donnell also lamented Trump’s appearance as the ""moral authority"" in the scandal, pointing to his two divorces as evidence that he should not be considered ""a model for the nation’s 20-year-olds."" ‘Dogs’ Kelly said Trump called women ""dogs."" One incident, as Todd brought up, refers to an insult he allegedly directed at Gail Collins, a liberal op-ed columnist for the New York Times who had interviewed Trump during his early years as a developer. In a 2011 Times column, Collins wrote, ""He is extremely sensitive to any gibes about his business record, which has been up and down over the years. During one down period, I referred to him in print as a ‘financially embattled thousandaire,’ and he sent me a copy of the column with my picture circled and ‘The Face of a Dog!’ written over it."" We could not independently verify Collins’ claim, or dig up her original story from a ""down period"" for Trump. But Trump directed similar language at Arianna Huffington on Twitter in April.  ‘Disgusting’ Kelly also referenced Trump’s treatment of a lawyer during a lawsuit involving one of his Florida developments. In a 2011 lawsuit, Elizabeth Beck, a lawyer representing Trump’s opponents, asked for a medical break, saying she had to pump breast milk for her 3-month-old daughter. But Trump objected, calling Beck ""disgusting"" when she took out the pump. Trump left the deposition, halting the day’s proceedings. Trump once traded barbs with the singer and actress Bette Midler, as Todd pointed out on Meet the Press. In 2012, Midler tweeted about Trump: ""The man who has ruined New York seeks to ruin the nation."" Midler deleted the tweet, but later referred to him as ""stupid"" and called his hairstyle a ""terrible dye job someone talked him into."" Trump replied by calling Midler ""disgusting,"" as well as ""grotesque,"" ""ugly,"" and a bad singer. We could not find documentation of an exact time he said ""disgusting animal,"" but he has certainly used both words. The Celebrity Apprentice Another remark came in 2013 during an episode of Trump’s reality show, The Celebrity Apprentice. During a judging session with Trump, former rocker Bret Michaels described a female contestant, Playboy playmate Brande Roderick, as ""falling to her knees"" and begging not to be fired. ""Excuse me,"" Trump said. ""You dropped to your knees?"" ""Yes,"" Roderick said. ""It must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,"" Trump said.  Our ruling Trump said that ""he didn’t say"" some of the things about women that Kelly talked about. The record, however, shows the opposite is true. He has said exactly what Kelly mentioned in the debate. We rate Trump’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9520c998-b1af-4223-a6b2-7acb3ccbb9c9",/factchecks/2015/aug/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-women-viciously-attacked-him-fir/

Dick Black says Jill McCabe backs selling fetal parts for profit
","Undercover videos in which Planned Parenthood officials discuss harvesting fetal tissue appall state Sen. Dick Black, R-Loudoun. A staunch opponent of abortion, Black is seeking to link the controversy to his Democratic opponent this fall, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician. McCabe ""supports selling late term abortions for bigger body parts,"" Black tweeted on July 28. He renewed the charge on Aug. 4, tweeting that McCabe ""supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable."" So we decided to examine Black’s charge. Let’s start with some background. The controversy over fetal parts erupted last month when the Center for Medical Progress, a conservative group that opposes abortion, released a nine-minute video secretly taped during a 2014 lunch with Deborah Nucatola, Planned Parenthood’s senior director of medical services. The center says the tape shows Nucatola talking about performing partial-birth abortions to keep body parts intact in order to ""sell"" them. The video put Planned Parenthood on the defensive and ignited Republican calls to end federal funding for the group and for investigations into its practices. Planned Parenthood provides a wide array of health services to women -- 97 percent of which are not related to abortions. The organization has denounced the secret taping as a misleading campaign by anti-abortion activists. Officials of the group say fetal tissues are integral to medical research and that the organization does not profit from their sale. Allegations by Black and others that profits were made raise legal questions. Federal law bars clinics from selling fetal tissue for gain. It’s legal, however, for clinics to donate the tissue for scientific research and receive reimbursement for their ""reasonable"" costs in providing the tissue. Cecile Richards, CEO of Planned Parenthood, has said the organization’s clinics don’t sell fetal tissue for profit but do provide it for research and are reimbursed for their collection costs. In the video, Nucatola discusses fees of $30 to $100 per specimen provided. Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, told PolitiFact National that the fees Nucatola discusses don’t appear geared to making a profit. Many of the sales are made to brokers -- middlemen who process the tissue and then sell it to researchers at significant markups. A vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells, for example, can sell for about $24,000. The brokers say their prices reflect their high costs of buying medical equipment and employing skilled technicians. Now, let’s get back to Black’s claim that McCabe supports selling fetal tissue for profit. Chris Lore, Black’s legislative assistant, told us the senator’s statement isn’t based on any statement from McCabe explicitly supporting the practice. Instead, Lore said, it’s implicit by the support she’s received from Planned Parenthood.The group has endorsed McCabe and has given her a 100 percent rating. Lore also noted McCabe has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia. In addition to those endorsements, Lore noted that amid the controversy, McCabe was quoted in a newspaper saying she still supports Planned Parenthood. ""You take those two facts into consideration and it seems her position is pretty clear,"" Lore said. Lore forwarded a copy of a Loudoun Times-Mirror story in which McCabe was asked about whether she still welcomed Planned Parenthood’s support in the wake of the controversy. ""I'm a doctor, and I take care of patients, including women,"" McCabe was quoted as saying. ""Women need health care choices and Planned Parenthood provides that. That's kind of the end of it for me."" We contacted Lore a second time for more information. After we spoke with him, Black posted this message on Twitter: ""PolitiFact is desperate to give cover to @DrJillMcCabe to give cover for supporting late term abortions. #MediaLies #PPSellsBabyParts."" We also reached out to McCabe to see what her position was on late term abortions and selling tissue for a profit. We heard back from Kyle Sutton, her campaign manager. ""Jill McCabe does not support late term abortions, but as a doctor she does understand that there are unfortunately circumstances where a pregnancy proceeding to full-term is not in the best health interest of either a mother, or child,"" Sutton wrote in an email.  What about selling fetal tissue for profit? ""Jill does not support selling fetal tissue for profit, the same way she does not support any illegal activities, because they're illegal,"" Sutton wrote. We also asked McCabe if she supports Planned Parenthood providing tissue for research at cost, without a profit. ""As a doctor, Jill McCabe understands life-saving medical research,"" her campaign manager wrote in an email. In an Aug. 1 story in the Washington Post story said McCabe said she had seen the Planned Parenthood videos and found them ""concerning."" But the newspaper also quoted her saying that ""Planned Parenthood is an important organization that provides vital services."" Our ruling Sen. Dick Black says McCabe, ""supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable."" McCabe indicates she supports late term abortions in instances when it is ""in the best health interest"" of the mother or child. She says she opposes the sale of fetal tissue for profit. Black links McCabe’s qualified support for late term abortions to what he says is an effort to profit from the sale of ""large baby parts.""  In effect, he’s accusing his opponent of supporting an illegal practice because U.S. law bans the sale of fetal tissue for profit. It’s incumbent of Black to prove his inflammatory claim and he offers nothing but speculation. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/aug/10/dick-black/black-says-jill-mccabe-backs-selling-fetal-parts-p/
"['Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Virginia', 'Jim Webb']","
Webb says U.S. has world's highest incarceration rate
","There are too many people in prisons, says former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, who’s seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. ""The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world,"" Webb says on his campaign website. Webb often made the same claim while representing Virginia in the U.S. Senate from 2007-2013, and he introduced unsuccessful legislation that would have set up a bipartisan commission to study prison and sentencing reform. He’s said alternatives to prison should be set up for nonviolent criminals such as drug offenders. Last December, we gave a True rating to Webb’s statement that the U.S. has 25 percent of the known global prison population despite having only 5 percent of the world population. This time, we’ll look into his claim that the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate on the planet. The most comprehensive and widely-cited examination of the world’s prison population comes from the International Centre for Prison Studies at the University of London, which looks at prison populations in more than 200 countries and territories. In a 2013 report, the group said the U.S. prison population rate of 716 inmates per 100,000 people was No. 1 in the world. But that’s not the end of the story. The center updates its figures monthly. The latest figures on the center’s web site show the U.S. has 698 prisoners per 100,000. That’s the second highest in the world. Before reading further, guess who’s No. 1 ... It’s the island nation of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean near Africa. It has a population of 92,000, including 735 living behind bars. That translates to an incarceration rate of 799 per 100,000 people. Experts have told PolitiFact National that Seychelles’ tiny population makes its incarceration rate difficult to compare to that of the United States, which has nearly 320 million people. After all, a modest increase of prisoners by U.S. standards, say 100, would dramatically spike the Seychelle’s rate. There’s a big caveat with the center’s rankings. The group does not have inmate tallies for several countries, including North Korea, which is widely believed to have a large prison population. Amnesty International estimated in 2011 that the reclusive nation had 200,000 prisoners. That would equate to a world-leading incarceration rate of 813 per 100,000. Among industrialized nations tracked by the center, the U.S. incarceration rate of 698 per 100,000 is in a stratosphere by itself. Russia ranks second at 455 per 100,000. There’s no doubt that the U.S. prison population has soared during the last 40 years. Department of Justice figures show the nation’s incarceration rate held steady at about 110 per 100,000 from 1925 to 1975. Experts have pointed to many reasons for more recent surge, including tougher sentencing laws and a zeal to crack down on illegal drugs. Our ruling Webb said the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world. The latest figures from the most comprehensive source show the U.S. is No. 2, behind Seychelles. There are data gaps for some countries, including such as North Korea whose prison figures can’t be verified but are estimated to be very high. That leaves the possibility that the U.S. could fall further down the list. It’s clear that the U.S. has one of the very highest incarceration rates in the world, but Webb’s claim that it’s the top doesn’t quite check out. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/10/jim-webb/webb-says-us-has-worlds-highest-incarceration-rate/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'John Kasich']","
Checking out John Kasich's claim that he was 'one of the chief architects' of balanced budget
","Days after the first Republican presidential debate, Donald Trump continues to exert a powerful gravitational pull on his GOP rivals. If they aren’t talking about him, they are talking about why they don’t care to talk about him. Ohio Gov. John Kasich aimed to steer clear of Planet Trump on the Sunday news shows. When ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Kasich if he thought Trump is a problem for his party, Kasich said he doesn’t think of things that way. ""What happened on Thursday is I was relaxed and I was able to talk about my record, balancing the federal budget, one of the chief architects, national security experience -- turning Ohio around."" Like Kasich, we’ll set Trump aside and dig into the facts behind Kasich and a balanced federal budget. This is one his prime talking points. Kasich often casts himself as one of the chief architects of a balanced budget. Sometimes he carries it a step further and says he’s the chief architect. In fact, he said that later in his talk with Stephanopoulos, and during his interview on CNN’s State of the Union. But in this fact-check, we’ll assess his more humble claim. Kasich the budget cutter Kasich first won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1982. He had a reputation as a young lawmaker with more than abundant energy, a brash style and a willingness to work across the aisle. He backed a balanced budget amendment when Republicans were in the minority, and he was a leading voice for the measure when a GOP wave put his party in charge of the House under Newt Gingrich in 1994. Gingrich promoted Kasich over more senior lawmakers and made him chair of the House Budget Committee. Kasich’s big moment came in 1997. The nation was poised for a balanced budget. Deficits had been shrinking for years, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Between 1992 and 1996, they fell at an annual average rate of 24 percent each year. When the Clinton administration submitted a budget that would eliminate the deficit by 2004, Kasich was the first Republican to reject and call for a do-over. In a February op-ed, Kasich wrote that ""it is not that difficult to cobble together a budget that could at least appear to be balanced within five years."" But he said a balanced budget amendment would force leaders to deal honestly with every budget in the future. ""If the politicians know they must not only achieve a balanced budget but also must maintain a balanced budget, they will have no choice but to develop credible solutions and do so sooner rather than later,"" Kasich wrote. No amendment emerged, but a bipartisan deal was struck by July, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, sponsored by Kasich, had a clear path. Kasich was at Clinton’s side when the bill was signed into law. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said of Kasich, ""More than any single man, he is responsible for balancing the budget."" There is no question that Kasich was a key player in the writing and passage of that law. Ramping up to a surplus The libertarian-leaning CATO Institute assessed the fiscal situation in 1998. Stephen Moore, the institute’s director of fiscal policy studies, gave the Republicans great credit for pushing for a balanced budget. He called the surplus the by-product of the GOP’s ""single-minded crusade to end 30 years of red ink."" But Moore argued that spending cuts had little to do with the final result. He noted that spending had risen $150 billion in two years. ""We have a balanced budget today that is mostly a result of 1) an exceptionally strong economy that is creating gobs of new tax revenues, and 2) a shrinking military budget,"" Moore wrote then. Other analysts reached much of the same conclusion, although with a few more nuances. John Gilmour is a political scientist at the College of William and Mary. Gilmour notes that there were significant spending reductions in the 1997 bill. It curtailed Medicare spending, but did it so severely that those cuts have been routinely reversed by Congress (the so-called ""doc-fix"" measures). When Gilmour ran the numbers from 1979 through 2000, he found a pattern that preceded that 1997 budget law. ""The budget surpluses resulted from revenues growing more rapidly than normal, and outlays growing somewhat more slowly than before,"" Gilmour said. That trend can be seen in this graph from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Both Gilmour and another researcher, political scientist B. Dan Wood at Texas A&M University, told PolitiFact that the groundwork for deficit reduction was laid in legislation passed in 1990 and 1993. The 1993 law increased taxes on the well-to-do as well as people of more modest means. Kasich opposed both measures. Wood notes that at least on paper, the 1997 law did trim spending by $127 billion between 1997 and 2002. He also points to the Tax Reduction Act of 1997 that, among other steps, reduced the capital gains tax from 28 to 20 percent, and child tax credits. But Wood says the timing of the surpluses and key elements of those two laws don’t line up. ""The budget was in balance before any of the provisions of these laws came into effect,"" Wood said. ""So, Kasich could not have been responsible for balancing the budget."" We came across a couple of reminders of how different the times were almost two decades ago. Not only did Kasich agree to do a fundraiser for a Democratic colleague in California (Gary Condit whose affair with Chandra Levy later toppled his career), but we came across this in a Washington Post article: ""Arianna Huffington, a conservative activist and columnist who has been encouraging Kasich to seek the nomination, said he is a fresh face in a party saddled with tired, ""recycled"" politicians. ‘He speaks with a passion,’ she said last week."" Huffington went on to become the publisher of the liberal-leaning Huffington Post. Our ruling Kasich said he was one of the chief architects of the balanced federal budget. Kasich has a long track record of pushing for a balanced budget, and contemporary accounts from 1997 place him very much at the center of the action. His description of being ""one of"" the chief architects, instead of the sole mastermind, also puts him on safer ground. Conservative and independent scholars point out that it is also worth remembering that there was more going on that actually led to not just a balanced budget but budget surpluses. Some of those factors were beyond Kasich’s power to influence, such as the economy. In addition, he opposed earlier fiscal bills that ultimately were followed by falling deficits, and deficits continued to fall before some key elements of the budget plans he crafted ever took effect. His statement is accurate but needs additional information. So we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/09/john-kasich/checking-out-john-kasichs-claim-he-was-one-chief-a/
"['Women', 'PunditFact', 'Heather McGhee']","
Republican presidential nominee hasn't won over women since 1988, says progressive pundit
","Personal attacks against Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly may have cost Donald Trump an invite to an influential conservative powwow, but a prominent progressive activist says ""batting away"" the frontrunner’s misogyny will do little to help the GOP. Heather McGhee, president of the liberal economic think tank Demos, said on Meet the Press that the Republican Party has both institutional and structural biases against women. ""I think it’s important to remember the Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won women since 1988, so this is a very deep problem for the party,"" McGhee said Aug. 9, 2015. ""It’s not going to be enough for anyone, a commentator or one of the candidates, to just disavow Trump’s sort of interpersonal sexist comments."" We were curious about McGhee’s 1988 statistic. Is it true that no GOP nominee candidate in almost three decades has earned more support from women than the Democratic nominee? McGhee pointed us to an article published Aug. 7, 2015, in the New York Times. Even though the article repeats the statistic without citing a source, we found several datasets that corroborate the claim with slightly different numbers. To be clear, the source of the information is surveys of voters, and includes exit polling data, so it's not an official record. But the surveys are widely cited as the best data available.  In 1988, Republican nominee George H.W. Bush received a single percentage point more of female votes (at 50 percent) than Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, according to research by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Since then, no GOP candidate has ""won"" the women’s vote.  Women overall have had a higher voter turnout than men in every presidential election for 35 years, almost always favoring liberal candidates. Their allegiance to the Democratic party is reflected in congressional races as well. Barack Obama earned 56 percent of women’s votes in 2008 — one of the highest shares of female voters ever — and 55 percent in 2012. Why do more women vote for Democrats? Aside from more women simply identifying as Democrats than men, women are also more likely to favor left-leaning policies of more government assistance for poor Americans, children and the elderly; providing better access to contraceptives and reproductive health; and protecting the environment, according to the Pew Research Center. Other factors include the rise of the powerful pro-choice PAC Emily’s List in the 1980s and 1990s and the controversy over Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, added Karen O’Connor, a professor of political science at American University's Women & Politics Institute. ""Women were very angry,"" O’Connor said of the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee’s questioning of Thomas’ former employee, Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment. The partisan gap has solidified in recent years, but experts say the female vote began to align with Democrats in 1980, eight years before Bush won a slight majority of female voters. Kelly Dittmar of Rutgers’ Center for American Women and Politics lists the feminist movement, increased participation in the labor force, and greater reliance on government programs as reasons for the shift. At the same time, men have shifted right, she said. Women generally favored GOP candidates from the suffrage movement in 1919 through the 1950s. Republican President Herbert Hoover was known as ""the woman's candidate"" in 1928, according to feminist scholar Jo Freeman. Democratic presidential candidates lost the female vote by double digits in 1952 and 1956, according to Gallup data. ""Early on, white upper-class women were Republicans,"" explained O’Connor. Then came the 1960s, with both parties responding to the feminist movement. The era of bipartisanship was reflected in the presidential elections, with Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson and Republican Richard Nixon each receiving substantial majorities of female votes. By the late 1970s, however, the political divide in women’s votes resurfaced and changed course. Christina Wolbrecht, a professor who studies gender and politics at the University of Notre Dame, points to a specific watershed moment: the 1980 Republican convention, when the party for the first time refused to endorse the Equal Rights Amendment. ""By the early 1980s, the two parties stood on opposing sides of the debate over women’s rights,"" Wolbrecht wrote in The Politics of Women’s Rights. Not that the GOP wasn’t aware of the divide. In his first term as president, Ronald Reagan responded by enacting policies that appealed to women. ""Reagan supported things like tax credits for child care and individual retirement accounts for homemakers, and the White House Working Group for Women was created in 1983,"" said Dittmar of Rutgers. ""He also appointed some women to high-profile posts (such as) Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court."" In his 1984 re-election, Reagan beat Walter Mondale and his female vice presidential pick with 56 percent of women supporting him. The experts said women are more driven by party lines than female candidates, which will make it hard for Republicans to upend the trend in 2016.   Our rating McGhee said, ""The Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won women since 1988."" The data, based on surveys of voters, backs her up. George H.W. Bush won his 1988 election campaign with just 1 percentage point more of female votes than his Democratic opponent. No Republican has ""won"" the fight for more women’s votes since. We rate McGhee’s claim True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/09/heather-mcghee/republican-presidential-nominee-hasnt-won-over-wom/

Christie says he was 'appointed' U.S. attorney the day before Sept. 11 attacks
","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wanted everyone at the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 cycle to know that he has experience prosecuting terrorists. When debate moderator Megyn Kelly asked him about Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's position on the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' phone records, he immediately invoked the worst terrorist attack on American soil in the country's history. ""I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state,"" he said. He said that meant he had unique experience as ""the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the PATRIOT Act"" as well as having ""prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after Sept. 11."" His comment started a back-and-forth with Paul, who spent more than 10 hours on the Senate floor in May protesting the PATRIOT Act. Christie characterized Paul’s experience as: ""sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this...."" Christie’s line about becoming the U.S attorney for New Jersey the day before 9/11 is similar to statements he’s made while campaigning in New Hampshire. We wondered: Is it true? A few of our PolitiFact readers were quick to point out a report published in the New York Times on Dec. 8, 2001, which said that on the day before – nearly four months after the terrorist attacks – President George Bush announced he would nominate Christie as the next U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The article notes, however, that the nomination had been ""expected for months."" Others pointed to a White House press release dated Dec. 7, 2001, saying the president ""intends to nominate"" Christie as the next U.S. attorney for New Jersey. That doesn’t appear to jibe with Christie’s claim that he was ""appointed"" on Sept. 10. We contacted Christie’s campaign in New Hampshire for clarification. A spokeswoman for Christie, Samantha Smith, wrote in an email Friday that Christie received a phone call on Sept. 10, 2001, from Attorney General John Ashcroft that set in motion a months-long hiring process. ""The point he was making was on Sept. 10 he accepted the job,"" Smith said in a phone interview. Smith pointed to an article in New Jersey's Star-Ledger newspaper from Sept. 11, 2001, which read: ""President Bush nominated former Morris County freeholder Christopher Christie as the state's next U.S. attorney yesterday."" It continues: ""...the White House notified Christie that he is the President's choice and that extensive background checks on his qualifications would begin immediately."" The story, written by Kate Coscarelli and Robert Cohen, estimated that those checks would take ""up to six weeks, after which the formal nomination would be put forth to the Senate."" Christie was officially confirmed by the U.S. senate on Dec. 20, 2001, and sworn into office on Jan. 17, 2002. Christie unequivocally stated twice that he was appointed on Sept. 10. Given free rein to choose his closing remarks, he circled back to the same story. ""I was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail,"" he said. As Christie stood on stage, he gave the impression that he took the job as U.S. attorney the day before the terrorist attacks and then he ""prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after Sept. 11."" However, the word ""appoint"" has more than one meaning. Merriam-Webster says the word can mean ""to fix or set officially,"" or ""to name officially."" Other definitions use verbs like ""assign"" and ""choose."" If that’s your interpretation, then Christie is closer to correct. In any case, the impression Christie left with the debate’s viewers was that he was in charge of prosecuting and investigating terrorists immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks. That’s misleading. Christie’s spokeswoman insisted that his point stood: The world was a different place after 9/11, and in that new world, Christie navigated the laws and brought terrorists to justice. Our ruling Christie said, ""I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state."" Christie said he received a phone call on Sept. 10, 2001, that began the process of his appointment as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey. However, he wasn’t nominated until months later, and he was sworn into the position until the following year. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4773c653-58b6-4f55-8158-c8b3e83ab0db",/factchecks/2015/aug/07/chris-christie/christie-says-he-was-appointed-be-us-attorney-day-/

Moderator Bret Baier of Fox News asked Carson whether he would have used military force against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after there was convincing evidence that Syrian forces had used chemical weapons on its own people. Carson didn’t answer the question directly. Rather, he said reductions in America’s military forces have curtailed its options. He segued from that into the charge that America’s stature on the world scene has suffered. ""Our friends can't trust us anymore,"" Carson said. ""You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We won't even give them offensive weapons."" In this fact-check, we will look at whether Carson has his history straight. Was Ukraine a nuclear state? And did it give up its nukes with assurances that the United States would protect it? The answer to the first question is: not really. As for promised protections, the signed documents tell us that America pledged not to attack Ukraine, and that’s quite different from a promise to defend it. Ukraine, nuclear weapons and the end of the Soviet Union The 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union generated enormous concern over the fate of the nuclear arsenal it had spread across three states that were newly independent -- Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- as well as in Russia itself. During the first six months of 1992, Moscow was quick to retrieve all of its tactical, or short-range, nukes. Corralling the strategic weapons, such as intercontinental missiles and bomber-based warheads, was trickier. Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed to dismantle or return what they had. But Ukraine looked at the roughly 1,900 warheads on its soil and began seeking something in exchange before it gave them up. Brian Finlay, a specialist in nonproliferation at the Stimson Center, a military-focused think tank in Washington, told us there was actually never any question that Ukraine would eventually relinquish those weapons. ""They had announced that they would become a non-nuclear weapon state even before their declaration of independence,"" Finlay said. ""Essentially, it was something that they traded off in order to encourage international recognition."" According to a report by Steven Pifer, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine between 1998 and 2000, Ukraine wanted Russia to promise to respect its sovereignty and its borders, a promise that Russia made but has since broken. But just as important, Ukraine wanted money. The highly-enriched uranium in the warheads was valuable, plus Ukraine wanted somebody else to cover the costs of dismantling the silos and other infrastructure. And Ukraine knew that going non-nuclear would open the door to better ties with the West. Ukraine couldn’t launch a single missile While Carson called Ukraine a nuclear-armed state, Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, told PolitiFact that there’s a big difference between housing a bunch of warheads and being able to fire them. ""The Ukrainians did not, repeat not, ever have the ability to launch these weapons — which is what would have made them a nuclear power, as Carson claimed,"" Bunn said. ""As you might imagine, command and control arrangements for intercontinental nuclear missiles are done very carefully, with an eye on security and making sure that nobody other than the authorized people can launch these things. There are codes and so on that are needed.  Even when you’re the officer sitting in the launch control center, launching the thing can’t be done without relevant commands, unlock codes, etc. from above."" Bunn said the Ukrainians were trying to figure out how to gain control of the weapons, but they never did. The only way they could be used was if the governments in Moscow and Kiev agreed to do so. Not only did Moscow hold the launch codes, but its troops had removed the firing systems on every warhead that was kept in storage in Ukraine. The deal that de-nuked Ukraine It took a series of agreements to finally clear the way for Ukraine to get rid of the weapons it held. Early in 1994, the United States agreed to provide money through the Nunn-Lugar program to dismantle Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure. Russia agreed to write down the debts Ukraine owed. In December 1994, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances. Pifer described in his report how Washington wanted security assurances that avoided creating broad guarantees. ""State Department lawyers thus took careful interest in the actual language, in order to keep the commitments of a political nature,"" Pifer wrote. ""U.S. officials also continually used the term ‘assurances’ instead of ‘guarantees,’ as the latter implied a deeper, even legally-binding commitment of the kind that the United States extended to its NATO allies."" The agreement stated that the United States, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom reaffirm certain commitments: To respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine. To refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine To seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used. Pifer writes that American diplomats went so far as to make sure that the Russians and Ukrainians understood specifically that the English meaning of ""assurance"" was not the same as a ""guarantee."" In short, the United States never promised to protect Ukraine. All it did was promise not to attack it. Our ruling Carson said Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state and that it gave up those arms with the understanding that the United States would protect it. While it is true that about 1,900 nuclear warheads were on Ukrainian soil, experts make it clear that Ukraine merely possessed the weapons and had no ability to use them. Meanwhile, the security agreements struck after the fall of the USSR specifically avoided committing the United States to protecting Ukraine, instead committing not to attack the newly created independent nation.

Ted Cruz: most GOP candidates 'have supported amnesty'
","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has a more aggressive stance on illegal immigration than the majority of his 2016 primary competitors, Cruz said at a primetime Republican debate Aug. 6. ""A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty,"" he said. ""I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer’s gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate."" (Schumer is U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.) Of the 10 candidates on the stage, how many of them have supported ""amnesty"" for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the United States? The tough part about this fact-check is that ""amnesty"" is a vague term; some consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements. We asked Cruz’s campaign staff how he would define ""amnesty,"" but they didn’t answer that question. Cruz himself has been adamantly opposed to a pathway to citizenship, but he’s been quiet on whether he would support some other legal status for illegal immigrants. We’ve previously found that in modern politics, the standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, supported and signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law allowed illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents if they met certain standards, such as proving they had been in the country for several years and paying back taxes and a fine. After meeting other requirements, the legal permanent residents could apply for a green card and eventually make their way toward citizenship. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. We do know Cruz considered the 2013 bipartisan Senate immigration proposal to be a form of amnesty and opposed the bill. The failed bill was similar to the Reagan law in that immigrants had to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status that put them on a path to citizenship, though the requirements are more stringent than the previous law. So we’ll use that bill as a rough standard for evaluating the positions of those who shared the debate stage with Cruz. Three debaters have expressed outright support for the Gang of Eight bill, so called after the bipartisan group of eight senators who proposed it in 2013. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., by Cruz’s standards, has been a clear supporter of amnesty, as he was a member of the Gang of Eight. At the time, he said the bill was ""not amnesty,"" and we rated that claim Half True because of the vague nature of the term ""amnesty."" Since then, Rubio has softened his support for a path to citizenship and emphasized border security, but he still supports passing immigration legislation. Fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, the former governor, said in March 2015 that he would put his support behind a Gang of Eight-style immigration bill that included a path to citizenship. Like Rubio, though, Bush insisted at the debate that his position is not amnesty, because his ideal plan requires illegal immigrants to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status. Recently, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has avoided saying whether or not he would support a path to citizenship, though he has suggested he would not blanket deport all illegal immigrants. But in 2013, asked by Fox if he would side with Cruz or the Gang of Eight, Huckabee said he would choose the latter -- though he emphasized an eventual immigration bill had to emphasize border security. He has also previously endorsed a path to citizenship. We could find only one of the candidates at the Aug. 6 debate (other than Cruz) who said he did not support this bill specifically. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., did not support the Gang of Eight bill because he said it did not include strong enough provisions for ensuring less illegal immigration in the future. But in a March 2015 speech, Paul walked a fine line -- supporting a path to some sort of normative legal status, but he did not use the word ""citizenship."" For the remaining four candidates, we could not find their opinions on the Gang of Eight bill specifically, but all four have at some point supported a path to citizenship or legal status, even if their position has since changed. While Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker no longer supports a path to citizenship, he said in 2013 that ""it makes sense"" people could not only stay in the United States but get citizenship after overcoming penalties, waiting periods and other requirements. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson has declined to comment on the Gang of Eight bill. He has said that the solution for illegal immigrants currently in the United States is for them to go back to their home country, where they can apply for a visa and return legally. In Carson’s 2012 book, America the Beautiful, he said a path to citizenship is a moral choice. In 2010, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he supported a ""commonsense path to citizenship."" But this year, he said he’s changed his mind and no longer supports such a path. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said in 2014 and 2015 that he isn’t keen on a path to citizenship, but he’s open to the possibility -- especially because you can’t deport everyone who is already here, and it would help get lawmakers to a point of compromise on immigration legislation. Despite his fiery rhetoric regarding Mexican immigrants, real estate mogul Donald Trump hasn’t said many specifics about what he’d do regarding the illegal immigrants already here. He has said this year that he would support a ""merit-based"" system for some illegal immigrants earning their right to stay, echoing comments he made in 2011. Many of these candidates have changed their position on what to do about the illegal immigrants already in the United States. But as far as we can tell, Cruz is the only one who has never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or some other form of legal status. Six have expressed outright support for a path to citizenship at some point in their recent political careers. It is worth noting again, however, that the definition of ""amnesty"" isn’t hard and fast, so what Cruz may consider amnesty might not be what any of these candidates considers to be amnesty. Our ruling Cruz said at a Republican debate, ""A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty,"" adding, ""I have never supported amnesty."" All of the candidates at the debate, with Cruz as the exception, have at some point in their recent political careers expressed support for a pathway to citizenship or other legal status for illegal immigrants currently in the United States, somewhat like was proposed in the Gang of Eight bill. Because there is no hard and fast definition for ""amnesty,"" some would argue that this does not necessarily count. However, it is reminiscent of 1986 legislation that was widely considered amnesty. By Cruz’s standards, any path to citizenship is amnesty. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/07/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-most-gop-candidates-have-supported-amnest/

Rand Paul says the Fourth Amendment 'was what we fought the Revolution over'
","During the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky stood out a bit when he cited America’s second president. It came during a heated exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about how much government intrusiveness was needed to keep Americans safe from terrorism. ""I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans,"" said Paul, who has been a leading voice in his party for privacy from government intrusion. ""The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights."" Taken in its most literal interpretation, this claim doesn’t make much sense, since the Fourth Amendment was ratified in 1791, about a decade and a half after the American Revolution began. But it’s pretty clear that Paul means that the issues embedded in the Fourth Amendment were a factor in the revolution, so that’s what we’re checking. Did Adams say the Fourth Amendment was ""the spark that led to our war for independence?"" For those who have forgotten what they learned in high-school civics class, the Fourth Amendment reads as follows: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."" From looking at the documents and checking with experts, it appears that Paul is basically correct in saying that Adams felt this way, though the second president never actually used the word ""spark"" himself. This goes back to the use of ""writs of assistance"" or general standing warrants that gave British law enforcement officials in Massachusetts -- Adams’ home state -- wide powers to inspect the property and possessions of colonists in order to root out the proceeds of smuggling. These warrants were long-lasting -- up to six months after the death of the issuing sovereign -- and they permitted officials to enter any house during the day. They did not require officials to obtain a more specific permission from a judge -- what would today be called a search warrant. Not surprisingly, many colonists saw these broad governmental powers as onerous. The issue came to a head in 1761, when a Boston lawyer, James Otis Jr., led a group seeking redress from the court. Otis and his fellow complainants lost the case, but their arguments made a deep impression on Adams, then a 25-year-old lawyer who was in the courtroom when the case was heard. Two documents show the significance of this case in Adams’ mind. One was a letter to his wife, Abigail, on July 3, 1776 -- 15 years later, and the day before the signing of the Declaration of Independence: ""When I look back to the Year 1761, and recollect the Argument concerning Writs of Assistance, in the Superiour Court, which I have hitherto considered as the Commencement of the Controversy, between Great Britain and America, and run through the whole Period from that Time to this, and recollect the series of political Events, the Chain of Causes and Effects, I am surprized at the Suddenness, as well as Greatness of this Revolution."" The second document was a letter Adams wrote to his former student, William Tudor, in 1817, more than half a century after the court arguments. Tudor was assembling Otis’ papers posthumously. ""Every Man of an immense crouded Audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take Arms against Writs of Assistants. Then and there was the first scene of the first Act of opposition to the Arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the Child Independence was born. In fifteen years i.e. in 1776. he grew up to Manhood, & declared himself free."" While some sources imply that Adams himself used the term ""spark,"" such as a Heritage Foundation guide to the Constitution, it was actually his grandson, Charles Francis Adams, who did. In 1856, Adams’ grandson published a biography of the second president. In it, the grandson wrote, ""In the year 1761, arose the question respecting the legality of writs of assistance, argued before the superior court of the province, by James Otis, and which Mr. Adams himself considered as the spark in which originated the American Revolution. …  No man can attentively read it without observing, in the argument, the seeds profusely scattered of the Revolution of Independence."" So Paul is generally correct about the centrality of the Otis case for Adams, even if Adams himself never used the word ""spark."" Was the Fourth Amendment ""what we fought the Revolution over""? According to experts we contacted, concerns about searches and seizures are more accurately described as one of the causes of the American Revolution, rather than ""what we fought the Revolution over."" ""The origins and issues over which the American Revolution was fought are complex, varied, and to this day, even among historians, debatable,"" said Amanda M. Norton, assistant editor of the Adams Papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society. While Adams did credit Otis’ argument, whether or not he was correct on that point ""is a matter of debate."" Serena Zabin, a Carleton College historian who specializes in the revolutionary era, agreed. ""It’s a gross oversimplification to say that the American Revolution as a whole was fought over search and seizure. Other key factors certainly include the British Empire trying to control white settlers from taking native Indian land, political arguments over economic regulations, and eventually a rising series of provocations and complaints on both sides."" The best place to look for a list of causes of the revolution is the Declaration of Independence, added Brian Murphy, an early-American historian at Baruch College of the City University of New York. These include the king’s refusal to acknowledge representative government, his close control of the judiciary, the forced quartering of British soldiers, the imposition of taxes without consent, and the provoking of Indian insurrections against the colonists, among many others cited in the founding document. ""The British lost the colonies through some very stupid, unforced errors, and (search and seizure) is one of those things,"" Murphy said. When we contacted Paul’s campaign, spokeswoman Eleanor May said that Paul didn’t claim that the Fourth Amendment was the only cause of the American Revolution. ""Sen. Paul stands by his statement, though he encourages every American to read the work of John Adams and our other Founding Fathers and draw their own conclusions,"" May said. Our ruling Paul said, ""The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence."" Paul definitely has a point. Adams’ writings clearly show that he believed the writs of assistance case was a key, early turning point of the revolution that began 15 years later. But even if it was one cause, it wasn’t the only one. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/07/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-fourth-amendment-was-what-we-fought/

Jeb Bush says he cut off funding to Planned Parenthood as governor
","Former Gov. Jeb Bush is using the recent release of activist videos criticizing Planned Parenthood as a chance to advertise his own record on restricting abortion. During the first Republican primary presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015, Bush sidestepped a question from Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly about his time on the board of the Bloomberg Family Foundation, which has donated millions to Planned Parenthood. Instead, Bush reiterated he had a long history of opposing abortion. ""Here’s my record: As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood. I created a culture of life in our state,"" he said. (Watch the exchange in the video here.) Bush earlier this week said the federal government should do the same. We’ve documented Bush’s opposition to abortion before, as well as his preference for abstinence-only education. But we wanted to check if he cut off state assistance for Planned Parenthood while governor, well before the current controversy. It turns out he did, long prior to recent calls to end federal funding for the group. Targeted cuts Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated nonprofit organizations that cooperate with each other, led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Funding comes from a wide range of sources, including private donations, grants, health center revenue and Medicaid. In Florida, there are currently two affiliates accredited with the national organization after several mergers, so the group is not organized quite the same as it was in 2001. There are now 23 health centers in the state, 16 of which provide abortion services. (Three of these were recently cited by the state Agency for Health Care Administration for allegedly providing second-trimester abortions without a license, violations Planned Parenthood has denied. A fourth was cited for improper recordkeeping.) Both Bush’s campaign and the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates pointed to the same thing: Two line-item vetoes Bush made to the state budget in 2001. According to a 2001 state fiscal analysis, Bush vetoed $115,759 in funding for Northeast Florida Planned Parenthood in Duval County and $187,084 for Department of Health contracts with Planned Parenthood in Collier and Sarasota counties. As governor, Bush was well-known for his frequent use of his veto power. That money was not for abortions, but was being used to provide family planning services to poor women, and had been available for more than a decade. To give you an idea of the scale of the state assistance, one of the affiliates confirmed in 2001 the payments made up about a quarter of their budget. It used the money to help pay for pap smears and sexually transmitted disease screening and treatment, among other services. The other affiliate noted the money went to treat patients who had no health insurance or access to Medicaid. Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida alliance, confirmed the group did not get any state funding after Bush’s 2001 veto. It still does not receive assistance from the state now. Our ruling Bush said, ""As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood."" In 2001, he used his line-item veto power to end funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates, and that funding never returned. We must note that the money was for family planning and health care services, not abortions, but he did cut off state money for the group. We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/07/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-cut-funding-planned-parenthood-go/
"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Rubio said he's never advocated for abortion exceptions for rape or incest
","In the wake of the Planned Parenthood video controversy, several of the Republican presidential candidates weighed in about abortion during the first GOP primary debate on Fox News. Here was the exchange between U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and moderator Megyn Kelly on Aug. 6: Kelly: ""You favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous. He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings. If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?"" Rubio: ""Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all --"" Kelly: ""You don't favor a rape and incest exception?"" Rubio: ""I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States."" PolitiFact readers asked us to fact-check Rubio’s claim that he never advocated for a rape and incest exception. Rubio’s record on abortion We soon found two Senate bills Rubio supported that includes exceptions for rape and incest. In November 2013, Rubio was one of 40 cosponsors of a Senate bill entitled ""Pain-capable unborn child protection act."" Several GOP presidential candidates backed the bill, including main sponsor Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and co-sponsors Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. The bill bans abortions at 20 weeks or greater but includes exceptions, including rape and incest: ""(1) where necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury, excluding psychological or emotional conditions; or (2) where the pregnancy is the result of rape, or the result of incest against a minor, if the rape has been reported at any time prior to the abortion to an appropriate law enforcement agency, or if the incest has been reported at any time prior to the abortion to an appropriate law enforcement agency or to a government agency legally authorized to act on reports of child abuse or neglect. …""  The 2013 bill stalled in committee; Graham sponsored a similar version in 2015 -- and again Rubio is listed as one of dozens of co-sponsors. This version also has a rape exception, although the language differs. It requires for adult women to obtain counseling or medical treatment for the rape 48 hours before the abortion, with separate criteria for minors about reporting the rape to law enforcement. We asked a Rubio spokesman about his claim in light of the 2013 bill. ""Marco has supported pro-life legislation with and without exceptions because they enhance protections for innocent life,"" Alex Conant told PolitiFact. ""Pro-life groups supported that legislation -- Marco has a 100 percent rating from National Right to Life in the 112th and 113th Congresses, and a 100 percent rating from the Family Research Council in the 113th Congress."" Rubio has long been an opponent of abortion rights, and his record bears that out. National Right to Life gave him a 100 percent rating for the 112th and 113th congresses. In both sessions, the ratings were based on five votes, such as cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood, repealing or defunding the Affordable Care Act and protecting free speech. The Family Research Council also gave Rubio a 100 percent rating for 13 votes in 2013-14. And NARAL, a group that supports abortion rights, gave Rubio a zero every year between 2011 and 2014. We found two examples of bills that Rubio voted for that did not appear to obtain a rape exception. In 2000, then state Rep. Rubio voted for a ban on late-term abortions, according to an article in the Miami Herald. The original version of that bill didn’t contain a rape exception, though it allowed a doctor to take steps to save the life of the mother. The Senate version of the bill had no rape exception, but it did have the exception about saving the mother’s life. That was signed into law by then Gov. Jeb Bush in May 2000. But within a couple of months, state officials gave up on enforcing the ban due to court decisions including a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The other example is a 2013 U.S. Senate bill that is similar to Graham’s proposal to ban abortion at 20 weeks or later; however, it only pertains to the District of Columbia. That bill, sponsored by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has dozens of co-sponsors including Rubio. The bill makes an exception to save the life of the mother but not for rape or incest. In an interview after the debate, Rubio told CNN’s Chris Cuomo, ""I'm in favor of a 20-week abortion ban. Does that mean I'm in favor of abortions at 19 weeks? No. Any bill that reduces the number of abortions is a bill that I'm going to support.""  Our ruling Rubio said during the debate about exceptions for rape and incest on abortion: ""I have never said that or advocated that."" Recently, Rubio has supported a bill that would have banned abortion after 20 weeks, and the bill did include exceptions for rape or incest. So Rubio has supported legislation with exceptions. However, we could find no evidence that Rubio has generally favored those types of exceptions, and we couldn’t find him specifically advocating for them. Rubio’s claim has an element of truth, but it leaves out important details. So we rate it Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2015/aug/07/marco-rubio/rubio-said-hes-never-advocated-abortion-exceptions/

John Cornyn says Planned Parenthood provided abortions, fielded aid, violating Hyde amendment
","U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said Planned Parenthood performed hundreds of thousands of abortions in a recent year while fielding hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars--in violation of federal law. Planned Parenthood has been under fire from Republican quarters in the wake of stealth videos showing its representatives talking about providing fetal tissue to individuals posing as medical researchers. And the day the Texas Republican piped up, the GOP-majority Senate was debating whether to shift federal aid from Planned Parenthood to other health care providers. Cornyn said in an Aug. 3, 2015, tweet brought to our attention by a reader: ""In FY 2014 Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions while receiving $528 million from taxpayers, in violation"" of ""the Hyde amendment."" Later in the day, after our initial inquiry, Cornyn deleted the tweet and posted a new one that left out mention of the Hyde amendment while saying that in 2013, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions; and in fiscal year 2014 received $528 million from taxpayers. Cornyn’s spokesman, Drew Brandewie, said by email that Cornyn wrote the new tweet because ""the timeframe for the data is inconsistent and presented in a confusing way in the"" latest annual report from Planned Parenthood, ""and it’s ambiguous as to whether or not federal funding is being directly used for or indirectly subsidizing abortions."" Separately, Cornyn left in place this similar tweet he’d posted Aug. 2, 2015:  We asked how Cornyn concluded Planned Parenthood received such money in violation of the Hyde amendment, which struck us as a potentially consequential no-no. Cornyn’s office did not say. The Hyde amendment refers to longstanding language barring federal funding for most abortions; the first version of the provision, named after its original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, passed into law in 1976. Texas is among more than 30 states to limit state funding of abortions in accord with the federal restrictions, according to a 2009 report by the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. The Hyde language does not single out specific groups barred from getting funds. Let’s cover Cornyn’s abortion count, then turn to the money he says Planned Parenthood got in violation of Hyde. Abortions provided To our inquiry, Brandewie pointed out Planned Parenthood’s latest annual report, published in December 2014. The report says the group provided 327,653 abortions in the 12 months from July 2013 through June 2014--while a headline on another chart says 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services in 2013 consisted of abortions and a footnote to that says the chart actually speaks to the 12 months that ran through September 2013. (Confusing? A bit.) Overall, the group said, its clinics provided nearly 11 million services to some 2.7 million patients. The report’s breakdown of other services: Sexually transmitted infection/disease testing and treatment: 4,470,597 Contraception: 3,577,348 Cancer screening and prevention: 935,573 Pregnancy tests: 1,128,783 Prenatal services: 18,684 Family practice services: 65,464 Adoption referrals: 1,880 Urinary tract infection treatments: 47,264 Other: 17,187 Government aid Brandewie also noted another page in the annual report listing $528.4 million in ""government health services grants and reimbursements"" in the 12 months through June 2014 as part of nearly $1.15 billion in total funding for the year. Other language on that page indicates this money reflects payments from Medicaid managed care plans. We spotted no other indication of what this aid was spent on. But news stories including an Aug. 2, 2015, New York Times article say defenders of Planned Parenthood, taking issue with a  move by Senate Republicans to divert the $528 million to other health care providers, say cutting the aid ""wouldn't affect the abortions it provides because federal money cannot be used for abortions except for cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is in peril,"" a reference to the Hyde restrictions. The Times’ story continued: ""Opponents say squeezing money from Planned Parenthood makes it choose between spending its remaining funds on abortions or other services."" Separately, Liz Clark, spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told us by email: ""The vast majority of public funding that Planned Parenthood receives is reimbursement for providing care to patients enrolled in Medicaid--2.2 million patient-visits a year. The rest helps provide basic, preventive care for low-income and uninsured women who have nowhere else to go; and goes toward important programs like teen pregnancy prevention and evidence-based sex education."" Clark also said: ""All government funds that Planned Parenthood affiliates receive are restricted for specific purposes. No federal funds can be used for abortion—with the rare exception of Medicaid funds in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman is in jeopardy (in accordance with federal law). As a high-quality health care provider, Planned Parenthood fully complies with this restriction and all federal and state laws and regulations."" Asked how many Medicaid-funded abortions were performed by Planned Parenthood over the 12 months within the Hyde restrictions, Clark said she didn’t have a figure. She otherwise pointed us toward a July 2015 Guttmacher Institute publication, ""Publicly Funded Family Planning Services in the United States,"" presenting detail on contraception services provided nationally. Generally in 2010, Guttmacher said, ""subsidized family planning services were provided at 8,409 safety-net health centers—3,165 (38%) were federally qualified health centers, 2,439 (29%) were health department clinics, 1,324 (16%) were other clinics, 817 (10%) were Planned Parenthood centers and 664 (8%) were hospital clinics."" But the document did not speak to abortions funded with government aid. To our query, Guttmacher spokeswoman Rebecca Wind guided us to a March 2012 institute report stating that according to its surveys of state and non-governmental agencies, U.S. states in fiscal 2010 spent $68 million on about 181,000 abortion procedures for low-income women, almost all of that in 17 states tapping their own funds to pay for most or all medically necessary abortions provided to Medicaid recipients. The report said federal aid, available only to pay for abortions permitted under the Hyde amendment, contributed to the cost of 331 of the procedures--including three in Texas, according to a chart. Our ruling Cornyn said: ""In FY 2014 Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions while receiving $528 million from taxpayers, in violation"" of  ""the Hyde amendment."" This tweet, which Cornyn later deleted, starts with basically accurate figures--the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood one recent year and government aid it says it fielded around that time. But linking the figures is misleading in that such funding largely pays for other health services. It’s also an unsubstantiated leap to say the money came in violation of decades-old restrictions on abortion funding. Far as we could tell, that just isn’t so. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Scott Walker says Wisconsin reserve fund 165 times larger under his leadership
","One of Gov. Scott Walker's talking points -- a claim about the size of Wisconsin’s budget stabilization fund -- is striking in seemingly contradictory ways. Here is how Walker phrased the claim Aug. 3, 2015 at a presidential candidate forum in New Hampshire: ""Our rainy day fund's 165 times bigger than when we first took office."" On one hand, ""165 times"" sounds like a huge increase. On the other, what was the size of the fund if it could be made 165 times larger? So let's dig in a little. To back Walker's claim, the governor's office cited two state reports. They show that the so-called rainy day fund was $1.68 million when Walker took office and now is $280 million. That's more than 165 times bigger. Some history The Wisconsin Legislature created the budget stabilization fund with a 1985 law. No significant deposits were made during the first 20 years of the fund’s existence, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s budget scorekeeper. But the 2001-’03 state budget added a requirement that whenever the state budget runs a surplus, 50 percent of the surplus must be transferred to the fund. So, a governor is required to put money in the rainy day fund whenever there is a surplus; it's not a voluntary act. At the same time, a governor can take some credit for there being a surplus in the first place. There have been three deposits to the rainy day fund as a result of budget surpluses since Walker took office in January 2011: Fall 2011: $15 million. That was a result of a surplus in the final budget of Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. (The end of that budget, it should be noted, came at the beginning of Walker's term. So, adjustments and actions in the final six months under Walker helped lead to the surplus.) Fall 2012: $109 million. While that was the largest deposit to the fund in state history at the time, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted, it was only enough to run state government for about three days. Fall 2013: $153 million. Those deposits, plus interest earned, put the total in the rainy day fund at $280 million. In 2014, with another surplus projected, Walker proposed a combination of tax cuts and adding another $117 million to the rainy day fund. But the tax-cut legislation he later signed suspended the required contributions to the fund for the 2013-’15 biennium. (The state's fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30.) Had the requirement remained in effect, it would have meant another $113 million in the rainy day fund. Walker instead used the money instead to help cut taxes. Still, there’s no question the fund has grown significantly under Walker. Our rating Walker said Wisconsin’s ""rainy day fund"" is ""165 times bigger than when we first took office."" The $280 million currently in the budget stabilization fund is 165 times larger than the $1.68 million when Walker took office. Walker signed a tax cut law in 2014 that contained a provision voiding a requirement that would have put another $113 million into the fund. But that doesn’t change how much larger the fund is.. We rate Walker’s statement True. (Editor's note: After this item was published, a spokeswoman for Walker's gubernatorial office noted that the budget that resulted in the Fall 2001 contribution overlapped with Walker's time in office. The item has been adjusted to reflect that. It does not change the rating.)",/factchecks/2015/aug/07/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-reserve-fund-165-times/

Not perfect with all the veterans
","Sen. John McCain isn't used to criticism about his support for veterans. After all, he spent five years in a Vietnamese prison camp and has staked his presidential campaign on a pledge to carry on the Iraq war.
 
But of late, McCain has taken heat from antiwar veterans groups such as VoteVets.org for hedging his support for legislation to expand federal funding to help veterans go to college and then for failing to show up for the Senate vote on a supplemental war spending bill that secured passage of the expanded GI Bill benefits last month.
 
So when a man confronted McCain during a July 7, 2008, town hall meeting — accusing the Arizona senator of speaking out against the GI bill — McCain got testy.
 
McCain responded that he hadn't opposed the enhanced educational benefits in the GI bill but wanted to ensure that they didn't stand in the way of the military securing re-enlistments. He said he and his allies successfully lobbied the bill's chief sponsor, Jim Webb of Virginia, to include a provision allowing a soldier who wanted to continue his military service to give his educational benefits to a family member.
 
All that was true. But then McCain took it too far.
 
""The reason why I have a perfect voting record from organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and all the other veterans service organizations is because of my support of them,"" he said.
 
To be sure, the VFW and the Legion have given McCain awards in the past and can be fairly described as McCain supporters. The VFW's political action committee has endorsed him for re-election to his Senate seat and to his House seat before that, but neither group keeps a voting scorecard.
 
At the same time, another veterans service organization cited by the McCain critic at the town hall meeting — the Disabled American Veterans — gave McCain only a 20 percent grade in its 2007 voting scorecard. McCain voted for only one of the amendments that the group tallied as key votes, while voting against the other four.
 
Likewise, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a relatively new group that was instrumental in pushing for the expanded GI Bill, says McCain only voted veterans' way on 58 percent of the 155 Senate votes it tallied between 2001 and 2006. Even the Vietnam Veterans of America reports that McCain has voted against 15 of 31 priority bills it tracked between 2001 and 2008.
 
As a result, we find McCain's claim to be False.

Killing the bill, or making it better?
","Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama have similar views on how to fix the nation's immigration laws. But that isn't preventing them from exchanging blame for holding up progress on the issue. McCain used a July 14, 2008, appearance at the National Council of La Raza convention to tout his work on immigration reform and fire a broadside at his Democratic rival. He depicted Obama as an obstructionist who helped derail congressional efforts to enact an overhaul package last year. McCain alluded to the political risk he took last year as a Republican presidential candidate by joining forces with liberal icon Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and others in promoting a compromise Senate immigration package. Then, he portrayed Obama as a politician willing to put short-term political gains ahead of substantive policymaking. ""I (helped draft the compromise bill) not just because I believed it was the right thing to do for Hispanic Americans. It was the right thing to do for all Americans,"" McCain said before the nation's largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. ""Sen. Obama declined to cast some of those tough votes. He voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the legislation, amendments that Sen. Kennedy and I voted against."" Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez, a McCain supporter, made similar charges in a July 11 conference call with reporters, saying Obama offered an amendment that bill supporters regarded as a ""poison pill"" for the way it would have terminated a temporary worker program. McCain and Martinez were referring to a series of votes the Senate took in early June 2007 at a particularly sensitive time in the immigration debate. A months-long effort to pass an overhaul bill that would have combined border security and enforcement measures with a temporary worker program had become caught in a stalemate between Democratic and Republican leaders over how much time to spend trying to amend the measure. The tension was exacerbated by a Memorial Day deadline that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., set for holding a final vote. Reid ultimately extended the debate into June, giving in to GOP demands. A key point of contention was a temporary worker program and a plan to allow millions of illegal immigrants to remain in the United States, work in the country and ultimately earn citizenship. President Bush campaigned in 2000 on the issue and had reached out to Democrats after they gained control of Congress. Some conservative Republicans criticized the so-called ""path to citizenship"" provisions, believing the best remedy was for Bush and Congress to address years of failed promises made by the federal government for stepped-up border enforcement. With the GOP divided, Democrats had little desire to boost the fortunes of a weakened president. And Democrats themselves were under pressure from their allies in organized labor, which opposed guest worker provisions. The result was that the Senate took up a politically fragile compromise package whose fate could have been threatened by any number of amendments. On June 6, Obama took aim at one component of the citizenship provisions, proposing to terminate after five years a new merit-based system for awarding green cards that confer permanent resident status. The merit-based system would have apportioned green cards based on the nation's economic needs and moved away from the existing system, which rewards family ties. A coalition of 40 immigrant rights groups, including La Raza, endorsed Obama's measure, saying the new system would discriminate in favor of immigrants with higher educations and training in specialty occupations. However, the Senate rejected Obama's amendment, 42-55. Hours later, Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., successfully offered an amendment to terminate the temporary worker program after five years. Dorgan contended the program would have the effect of bringing cheap labor in through the back door and squeezing out American workers. In spite of pleas from Kennedy, who said Congress should give the program a chance to work, the Senate adopted the amendment in a 49-48 vote, with Obama siding with Dorgan. Republicans like McCain who helped write the compromise immigration overhaul regarded the guest work provisions as essential and branded Dorgan's effort a ""deal-breaker."" But as they tried to undo the damage, Reid took steps to pull the bill from consideration and end the debate. The legislation collapsed amid three failed votes to cut off debate on June 7. Immigration experts say Obama was one of a host of senators who tried to influence the package, but was not a pivotal participant in the debate. ""McCain drove comprehensive immigration reform legislation and bucked his party knowing full well what the consequences would be. Obama was a player, but he was nothing like the central player McCain was in either 2006 or 2007,"" said Tamar Jacoby, president and chief executive officer of ImmigrationWorks USA, a Washington-based advocacy group advancing immigration reform. Angela Kelley, director of the Immigration Policy Center in Washington, said Obama's amendment put Senate Democrats in a particularly tough bind, because it would have scrapped a Bush administration points-based system of awarding green cards based on family ties. Yet adopting it would have greatly complicated prospects for the plan co-authored by Kennedy, one of the party's icons. ""There's no black or white answer on it,"" Kelley said. ""If you want to say Obama was offering that kind of an amendment (poison pill), the Republicans would say, sure, because they had a lot of control in what got to the heart of the bill. If you also want to say Obama wanted a sober debate about what made sense for the immigration bill, he did that, too. It was like an optical illusion, the same picture seen two ways."" Kelley said Dorgan's amendment was bitterly opposed by business interests and went to the heart of the bipartisan plan. ""They described the Dorgan amendment as a poison pill at that time,"" she said. It's a fact that Obama's actions came at a critical point in the immigration debate and threatened a fragile political compromise. And he supported Dorgan's amendment, which was considered the poison pill McCain describes. But it's not accurate to describe Obama's amendment in the same terms. It addressed what many experts viewed as a central component of any viable immigration reform package. McCain and his camp are exaggerating Obama's role by portraying him as a giant-slayer without offering any proof Obama was intent on killing the entire package. For these reasons, we deem McCain's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2008/jul/17/john-mccain/killing-the-bill-or-making-it-better/

27 states mandate equitable coverage
","Carly Fiorina, former Hewlett-Packard chief executive and now campaign adviser to Sen. John McCain, grabbed news headlines July 7, 2008, when she said: ""There are many health insurance plans that will cover Viagra but won't cover birth-control medication. Those women would like a choice.""
 
Her comments came during a discussion of consumer-driven health plans in a breakfast meeting with reporters in Washington, D.C.
Problem is, she's wrong to say that's the case with ""many"" plans.
 
A study by the Guttmacher Institute in 2002 found that 86 percent of employer-purchased insurance plans covered a full range of contraceptive methods, up dramatically over the previous decade. One reason is that 27 states have passed laws requiring fully-insured employer health insurance plans that cover prescription drugs to provide ""equitable"" coverage for contraceptives. In short, if an employer is going to offer prescription drugs, contraceptives have to be among the options.
 
A spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group that represents 1,300 health insurance companies, had no specific data but said both birth control and Viagra tend to be covered by its members' plans. Aetna, one of the nation's largest commercial insurers, said even its most restrictive drug plan includes generic oral contraceptives. Viagra, meanwhile, is only available from Aetna if an employer buys a separate rider for the company's policy.
 
The wild cards here — and the reason Fiorina is right in some cases — are large companies that are self-insured, paying claims directly. These employers define their own benefit plans and are regulated by federal, not state laws.
 
One such employer is Union Pacific Railroad, based in Omaha, Neb., which was sued for denying coverage for contraceptives while providing drugs to treat male erectile dysfunction. Last year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's ruling and determined that the railroad's policy did not discriminate against female employees.
 
Abortion rights groups have been working since 1997 on passage of federal legislation to expand equity for contraceptives to all employers' plans. McCain voted against such legislation in 2003 and again in 2005. According to NARAL, the abortion-rights advocacy group, McCain has voted against family planning 22 times. McCain has opposed insurance mandates on the grounds that they make health plans more expensive.
 
Two days after Fiorina made her statement, McCain ducked the issue in comments to reporters aboard his campaign bus in Portsmouth, Ohio. ""I certainly don't want to discuss that issue,'' he said.
 
Planned Parenthood is using McCain's response with the Viagra vs. birth control issue, as

captured on a YouTube video,

in ads now running in six states.

See it here.

 
Back to Fiorina's statement that ""there are many health insurance plans that will cover Viagra but won't cover birth-control medication."" Efforts to force employers to cover birth control have failed in Congress, but state mandates and employee pressure force most companies to make such coverage available. We rule this Barely True.

Backtracking on the path to citizenship
 ","Seeking to portray his Republican rival as a flip-flopper on a critical issue for Latino voters, Sen. Barack Obama used a July 8, 2008, appearance before the League of United Latin American Citizens to note remarks Sen. John McCain made that appeared to disavow an immigration plan McCain had championed in Congress.
 
""Now, I know Sen. McCain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform — and I admired him for it,"" Obama said. ""But when he was running for his party's nomination, he abandoned his courageous stance, and said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote.""
 
Obama is referring to comments McCain made during a Jan. 30, 2008, Republican candidates' debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. At issue was the immigration plan that McCain helped shepherd through the Senate in 2006 that combined border security and work-site enforcement to root out undocumented employees, with a guest worker program for most of the illegal immigrants in the country.
 
House Republicans, who favored tough enforcement measures, branded the Senate measure as ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants and the work of Democrats. They refused to participate in discussions to negotiate a compromise plan and instead passed a series of narrow bills aimed at thwarting illegal immigration. Most were never enacted into law, though Congress cleared a separate border fence bill.
 
Asked during the debate whether he would vote for his original proposal if it came to the Senate floor again, McCain first demurred, saying it would not return in that form. But when pressed, he said he would not, because public opinion favored enforcement over citizenship measures.
 
""I would not, because we know what the situation is today,"" McCain said. ""The people want the border secured first. And so to say that that would come to the floor of the Senate — it won't. We went through various amendments which prevented that ever — that proposal.""
 
Asked again to confirm he would not vote for his bill as originally drafted, McCain replied, ""My bill will not be voted on; it will not be voted on. I will sit and work with Democrats and Republicans and with all people. And we will have the principals securing the borders first.""
 
McCain's comments acknowledge many Republican primary voters' preference for tough enforcement measures. But in 2007, he supported another plan to rewrite immigration laws that resembled the previous year's effort and included a so-called ""path to citizenship"" for the estimated 12-million undocumented immigrants in the country. From these actions, one can infer McCain has toggled between endorsing enforcement measures and broader immigration plans that also address citizenship, depending on the circumstances. All of which backs up Obama's assertion.
 
However, Obama is laying it on thick in stating McCain bucked his party in crafting the original plan. The immigration plans McCain championed were a priority of the Bush administration and Republican leaders in the Senate. To be sure, they infuriated grass-roots conservatives, who constitute a core GOP constituency and have long been critical of McCain's position on a host of issues. But in this case, Obama may be giving McCain too much credit for being a maverick in order to make the about-face more dramatic.
 
Still, because McCain essentially disavowed his original comprehensive immigration proposal and said repeatedly he would focus on border security as president, we judge Obama's statement Mostly True.

Obama seems to have change of heart
","It comes at the end of a laundry list of alleged flip-flops by Sen. Barack Obama, contained in a news release from Sen. John McCain's campaign.
 
Change #17: ""Barack Obama said he would debate 'anywhere, anytime' but has rejected joint town hall meetings.""
 
McCain has repeatedly proposed as many as 10 town hall meetings this summer; the Obama campaign countered with a proposal for two joint appearances this summer. Currently in stalemate, the McCain campaign claims Obama reneged on a promise to engage him ""anywhere, anytime."" And so now, inevitably, we have a debate over debates.
 
The genesis of Obama ""anywhere, anytime"" comment dates back to a May 16, 2008, speech in Watertown, S.D.
 
""I am happy to have a debate with John McCain and George Bush about foreign policy,"" Obama said. ""If John McCain wants to meet me anywhere, anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in Iraq, Iran, the Middle East or around the world, that is a conversation I'm happy to have, because I believe that there is no separation between John McCain and George Bush when it comes to our Middle East policy, and I think their policy has failed.""
 
If it was a sitcom, Obama's ""anywhere, anytime"" challenge would have been followed by an audience ""Oooooh.""
 
In a speech on June 4, McCain stepped up and proposed a series of 10 town hall meetings, one a week until the week before the Democratic National Convention (in addition to the three traditional debates after the conventions).
 
""I suggest a town hall meeting format because I believe it's the best way,"" McCain said. ""I don't think we need any big media-run productions, no process questions from reporters, no spin rooms, just two Americans running for the highest office of the greatest nation on Earth responding to the concerns of the people whose trust we must earn.""
 
Many speculated that such an intense and unprecedented schedule of town hall meetings would benefit McCain, providing national media exposure to a campaign that is likely to be vastly outspent on television advertising.
 
Obama seemed warm to the idea.
 
On the same day, Obama told ABC, ""Oh, we're definitely going to be doing some town hall debates.""
 
""I look forward to, you know, having more than just the three traditional debates that we've seen in recent presidential contests,"" Obama said.
 
But then the Obama campaign countered with a proposal for five joint appearances: the three traditional debates after the conventions, plus a joint town hall on the economy in July and a debate on foreign policy in August. So really just two additional appearances before the regular debates.
 
The McCain campaign declined. Politico reported that the single town hall Obama agreed to would have been on the Fourth of July weekend, a guaranteed ratings loser that McCain spokesman Brian Rogers referred to as a ""total joke.""
 
McCain campaign manager Rick Davis wrote a letter to the Obama campaign stating, ""We fear that our negotiations over joint town hall meetings are turning into a debate about process. That is exactly what we have always hoped to avoid, and why we proposed a town hall format that would render many of these process issues moot.
 
""We remain committed to this idea because joint town hall meetings offer the best format for presenting both candidates' visions for our country's future in a substantive way. We have a chance to change the way presidential elections are run and elevate the political dialogue. Americans deserve this kind of opportunity, and we hope that Sen. Obama will join us at town hall meetings throughout the summer months.""
 
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe responded that Obama's proposal for five joint appearances ""would have been the most of any presidential campaign in the modern era, offering a broad range of formats and representing an historic commitment to openness and transparency.
 
""It's disappointing that Sen. McCain and his campaign decided to decline this proposal. Apparently they would rather contrive a political issue than foster a genuine discussion about the future of our country.""
 
An Obama campaign spokesman said on July 11 that nothing has changed since that stalemate.
 
Clearly there is a lot of posturing going on. But did Obama backtrack? His ""anywhere, anytime"" challenge was issued specifically ""to debate about our respective policies in Iraq, Iran, the Middle East or around the world."" The Obama campaign did offer an ""in-depth"" foreign policy debate in August.
 
And he didn't reject the town hall concept, he just wasn't willing to do as many as McCain wanted.

Still, after seemingly endorsing the idea, Obama's offer of just two appearances (one on a holiday weekend) beyond the traditional postconvention debates sounds like a change of heart.

 
We rate McCain's claim Half True.

Raised awareness, but doesn't get sole credit
","Trying to tap voter frustration with Washington's political establishment, Sen. John McCain used a July 8, 2008, appearance on Fox News to remind viewers about his role investigating the political corruption scandal involving disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. His comments imply that his work directly resulted in guilty pleas.
 
""The American people are angry when we see spending completely out of control . . . when we see corruption, that former members of Congress are now in federal prison,"" McCain said on the

Fox and Friends

program. ""I investigated Abramoff and people ended up in jail, of course we get angry. Americans are angry now.""
 
McCain is referring to a two-year investigation he led as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that detailed how Abramoff and his associate, Michael Scanlon, defrauded Indian tribal clients of tens of millions of dollars.
 
The probe involved extensive interviews and subpoenas, five committee hearings and a review of some 750,000 pages of records. A resulting 373-page report, approved by the panel in June 2006, outlined the circumstances under which six tribes paid Scanlon approximately $66-million for grass-roots lobbying activities during a three-year period, one-third of which Scanlon delivered to Abramoff.
 
Republicans and Democrats alike have praised McCain for aggressively pressing the issue. And the hearings led to expanded inquiries into Abramoff's efforts to pressure former Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and other senior Interior Department officials on behalf of Indian tribes with gambling interests.
 
But McCain wasn't the only one investigating. Federal prosecutors also were conducting extensive investigations into how Abramoff and Scanlon laundered millions of dollars through charities and front organizations in an effort take their cut of the proceeds and avoid paying taxes. Those probes and spinoff inquiries directly resulted in more than a dozen guilty pleas.
 
Scanlon in November 2005 pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge stemming from his efforts to defraud tribes as part of the corruption scheme. He agreed to cooperate with investigators.
 
Though there are several former members of Congress currently serving prison time on corruption charges, as McCain indicated, only ex-Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, was convicted as part of the Abramoff investigation. In January 2007, Ney was sentenced to 2 years in prison after acknowledging taking bribes from Abramoff. In February 2008, he was released from prison and moved to a halfway house. However, Ney's activities were not a particular focus of McCain's investigation.
 
McCain can legitimately take credit for snaring a senior Interior Department official in his probe. Ex-Deputy Interior Secretary J. Steven Griles, the former No. 2 official in the department, pleaded guilty in March 2007 to lying to the Indian Affairs Committee about his relationship with Abramoff during testimony on Nov. 2, 2005, and during an earlier deposition with panel investigators on Oct. 20, 2005. In June 2007, Griles was sentenced to 10 months in prison and a $30,000 fine.
 
Another Bush administration figure who went to prison in connection with the scandal was David Safavian, the former chief of staff of the U.S. General Services Administration. Safavian was sentenced in October 2006 to 18 months in prison for lying to McCain's committee, the GSA's inspector general and a GSA ethics officer about his efforts to help Abramoff obtain control of two properties controlled by the GSA and covering up a golf trip he took with Abramoff to England and Scotland in 2002. However, a federal appeals court in June 2008 threw out some of the charges and ordered a new trial.
 
As for Abramoff himself, the ex-lobbyist in March 2006 was sentenced to nearly six years in prison in a separate case — for defrauding banks of $23-million while purchasing a fleet of gambling boats in Florida in 2000. While he serves his sentence, Abramoff is cooperating with authorities in the ongoing corruption investigation of administration officials, lawmakers and their aides.
 
At least 14 individuals caught up in the corruption probe or the Florida case have pleaded guilty to various charges. Most were sentenced to probation in return for their cooperation in the investigation.
 
It certainly can be argued that McCain was the most aggressive member of Congress who investigated the Abramoff affair, and that his efforts expanded inquiries into wrongdoing that ultimately resulted in the convictions of Bush administration officials, congressional staffers and businesspeople. And though McCain didn't directly send any of the wrongdoers to jail, Griles, the former Interior Department deputy, wound up serving time specifically because he lied to investigators from McCain's committee. For this reason, we rule McCain's statement Mostly True.

Obama-Lugar measure included weapons of mass destruction
","In a new television ad, Sen. Barack Obama makes the case for America leading international efforts to control nuclear weapons.
 
""The single most important national security threat that we face is nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists,"" Obama says in the ad. ""What I did was reach out to Sen. Dick Lugar, a Republican, to help lock down loose nuclear weapons. We have to lead the entire world to reduce that threat. We can restore America's leadership in the world.""
 
We checked into Obama's legislative record with Sen. Lugar, a Republican from Indiana.
 
Obama's first foreign travel as a U.S. senator was with Lugar in August 2005, when the two men visited nuclear weapons storage and dismantlement facilities in Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.
 
The following spring, Lugar and Obama authored a Senate bill that authorized the president to carry out a program to provide assistance to foreign countries to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The bill does not specifically list different types of weapons of mass destruction, but we'll take as a given that it includes nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 
The larger part of the legislation was a separate measure to stop the spread of conventional weapons, notably shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles that the legislation refers to as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS.
 
The bill's provisions were incorporated into a House bill that passed later that year and was signed into law in January 2007.
 
The Lugar-Obama initiative is modeled after a 1991 bill authored by Lugar and former Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn. The Nunn-Lugar program provided U.S. funding and expertise to the former Soviet Union to dismantle stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 
We'll note here that the legislation Obama and Lugar sponsored did not deal solely with nuclear weapons, but rather with all weapons of mass destruction, and that a good bit of their legislation focused on conventional weapons. But it does seem like part of the legislation's intent is to ""help lock down loose nuclear weapons."" For that reason, we find Obama's statement to be True.

McCain's spokesman said Obama reversed a vow to filibuster any bill that immunized phone companies from lawsuits for letting the government eavesdrop on their customers without warrants.
 
""A few short months ago, Barack Obama outwardly opposed terrorist surveillance legislation, saying that he would filibuster any bill that includes immunity for American telecommunications companies that had been asked by the government to participate in the program,"" McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a

news release

on July 9, 2008. ""Today, the U.S. Senate will approve legislation providing the immunity Barack Obama supposedly opposed, and despite his promise, he will not support a filibuster.""
 
At issue is a surveillance program launched by the National Security Agency after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The agency asked telecommunications companies such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to help it monitor the international calls and e-mails of customers in the United States without warrants.
 
The

Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act

requires court approval for domestic surveillance. Anyone who violates the law is subject to fines of up to $10,000 or five years in prison.
 
So after the New York Times

exposed

the wiretapping program in 2005, the telecommunications companies were vulnerable to lawsuits from irate customers. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 46 lawsuits have been filed against the phone companies.
 
The Bush administration asked Congress last year to grant the telecom companies immunity from the lawsuits. McCain and most other Republicans supported a measure that would do so, but some Democratic leaders, under pressure from liberal bloggers and civil liberties advocates, opposed it.
 
Obama was one of those leaders.
 
In October 2007, Obama spokesman Bill Burton issued

this unequivocal statement

to the liberal blog TPM Election Central: ""To be clear: Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies.""
 
Key segments of the Democratic base — enjoying substantial influence in the run-up to the Democratic presidential primaries — were pleased. ""This is the kind of leadership we need to see from the Democratic candidates,"" MoveOn spokesman Adam Green said at the time.
 
But recently the Senate again took up legislation that would let the phone companies off the hook. It would also expand the government's domestic spying powers.
 
Obama supported an amendment that would have stripped telecom immunity from the measure. But after that amendment failed, Obama declined to filibuster the bill. In fact, he voted for it. It passed the Senate, 69-28, on July 9. The House passed the same bill last month, and Bush said he would sign it soon. (McCain missed the vote because he was campaigning in Ohio, but he has consistently supported the immunity plan.)
 
In a message to supporters, Obama defended his position, citing a phrase Democrats fought to include that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the ""exclusive"" means of wiretapping for intelligence. The bill ""is far better than the Protect America Act that I voted against last year... (because it) makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the FISA court.""
 
Obama also cited a provision requiring several inspectors general — who are internal government watchdogs — to investigate the program. ""It will allow a close look at past misconduct without hurdles that would exist in federal court because of classification issues,"" Obama said.
 
None of that, however, negates Obama's promise to filibuster ""any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies."" He declined to do so.
 
Obama's campaign did not respond to our request for comment. But in this case, it's clear that the McCain campaign's accusation of a flip-flop is True.

Obama wants to reduce stockpiles, not disarm
","Anonymous e-mails claim that Sen. Barack Obama wants to ""unilaterally disarm our nation"" — and they say they have the video to prove it.
 
""You do not have to check Snopes to determine if this is true or false ... watch and listen to Obama's own words,"" warns one e-mail.
 
""Look at this ASAP — it may be pulled from the Obama Web site very soon,"" another e-mail states.
 
""This is shocking and reprehensible,"" opines a third e-mail.
 
All the e-mails link to YouTube video that shows Barack Obama talking about his defense policies. The only problem is, Obama doesn't say in the video that he wants to disarm the United States.
 
Rather, Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq, curtailing wasteful defense spending, and negotiating with Russia to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. He says he wants ""a world without nuclear weapons,"" but as we'll explain shortly, that statement is well within the mainstream of U.S. foreign policy thought.
 
We went looking for the source of the video and found it fairly quickly on the Obama campaign Web site. The official version includes opening and concluding remarks in which he emphasizes he will eliminate wasteful spending and make his sole priority protecting the American people.
 
Obama's campaign created the video while campaigning to win the Iowa caucuses. Obama was seeking the endorsement of Caucus4Priorities, an Iowa-based advocacy movement that wants a portion of defense spending diverted to domestic issues like education and jobs. The group instead endorsed John Edwards.
 
Here's Obama's statement in its entirety. We've noted where the edited version in the chain e-mails begins and ends:
 
""Thanks so much for the Caucus4Priorities, for the great work you've been doing. As president, I will end misguided defense policies and stand with Caucus4Priorities in fighting special interests in Washington. First, I'll stop spending $9-billion a month in Iraq. [Edited video starts.] I'm the only major candidate who opposed this war from the beginning, and as president, I will end it.
 
""Second, I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems, and I will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary spending.
 
""Third, I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons. I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material, and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals. [Edited video ends.]
 
""You know where I stand. I've fought for open, ethical and accountable government my entire public life. I don't switch positions or make promises that can't be kept. I don't posture on defense policy, and I don't take money from federal lobbyists for powerful defense contractors. As president, my sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the American people. Thanks so much.""
 
We suspect that the phrase ""a world without nuclear weapons"" may have set off Obama's anonymous critics. Actually, that goal has been promoted by foreign policy experts on both sides of the political aisle. Obama's goal echoes an opinion piece published in the

Wall Street Journal

on Jan. 4, 2007, authored by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn. Its title: ""A World Free of Nuclear Weapons.""
 
""The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete,"" their essay said. ""Deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective.""
 
The piece then goes on to argue for similar points as Obama mentions in his statement, though in more detail.
 
The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee.
 
The piece kicked off enough discussion and debate in the foreign policy community that the quartet authored another piece for the

Wall Street Journal

a year later, titled ""Toward a Nuclear-Free World,"" in which they discussed growing support for their ideas.
 
Not everyone agreed, of course. In May 2008, the

Weekly Standard

published a detailed critique of the policies by Gary J. Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute and Henry Sokolski of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, who argued that their proposed solutions would be difficult to implement.
 
For our fact-checking purposes, the point here is that Obama's statement falls firmly within the mainstream of the U.S. foreign policy debate. His position does not constitute unilateral disarmament, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security.
 
""He's advocating the abolition of nuclear weapons in general, not nuclear disarmament,"" Pike said. ""If you're going to disagree with him, you have to understand what you're disagreeing with.""
 
The notion of unilateral disarmament is pretty much a nonstarter for both major political parties, including Obama, he added.
 
""Outside of the religious pacifist community, that is just not a policy position that has had meaningful political support in the United States,"" Pike said.
 
One of the outlets that has promoted the Obama-wants-to-disarm-us argument is the conservative blog Macsmind. Macsmind linked on Feb. 27, 2008, to a YouTube video; several of the e-mails we received linked to the Macsmind post. Macsmind posted the commentary, ""Sen. McCain, you should grab this video and play it on every ad you can. This is absolutely shocking reprehensible. He plans to universally disarm our nation (sic). The question is for what, and more specifically 'for whom'.""
 
On June 8, Macsmind posted a full version of the video, noting ""some lefties are complaining that the video is a hack job and it's out of context. Therefore I present to you context.""
 
Macsmind and others may not like the foreign policy goals that Obama outlines in his video, but it's deceptive to call those goals unilateral disarmament. For this reason, we find this the chain e-mail's statements to be False.

Ad takes most of McCain quotes out of context
","A new Web ad from the Democratic National Committee portrays John McCain as giving wildly different opinions on when U.S. troops can leave Iraq.
 
The ad begins, ""When Will John McCain Bring Our Troops Home? Depends on When You Ask.""
 
It then shows seven edited clips of McCain speaking, saying things like, ""Four or five years … five or six years … another year to a year and a half … maybe 100 … that's not too important."" (

View the ad here

.) A fever line tracks the years on a chart while ominous music plays in the background.
 
We decided to examine the transcripts of McCain's comments and see if he did give the many varied withdrawal dates that the ad claims. We found several problems with the way the ad portrays McCain's statements. In one case, he's not talking about troop withdrawal at all. In the ""100 years"" remark, he was talking about a permanent peacetime force similar to what the United States now has in Japan and South Korea. And the ""not too important"" comment is also taken significantly out of context.
 
Let's take the ad's points one by one and examine the context of the McCain interviews to see where the ad gets it right and where it gets it wrong.
 
•

From the ABC News show ""Nightline,"" Oct. 1, 2003:

 
Question: ""Over a course of how many years?""
 
McCain: ""Four or five years.""
 
This quote comes from an interview between Ted Koppel and John McCain, but the ""four or five years"" quote has nothing to do with U.S. troops. Instead, the show, which aired seven months after the initial invasion, focused on the costs of rebuilding Iraq. Koppel's report was skeptical of a claim from a Bush administration official that U.S. taxpayers would only be on the hook for $1.7 billion in reconstruction costs. (He was right to be suspicious; a 2007 GAO estimate put the reconstruction price tag at $40 billion and counting). Koppel interviewed McCain for his views on rebuilding costs, and even then McCain disputed the Bush administration claim.
 
Here's a fuller excerpt from the interview:
 
McCain: ""I think there (were) many of us, in fact, most of us that believed that the military part would be the easy part. And reconstruction and rebuilding Iraq would be the hard part. But I have to also tell you, we did not realize the state of total deterioration of the Iraqi infrastructure. We didn't appreciate how much Saddam Hussein had let everything go to hell. I knew it was going to be very tough. I didn't know until I went over there how much it was going to be. And may I say, it's going to be a lot more than $20 billion before we're through.""
 
Koppel: ""Do you have a sense of how much more?""
 
McCain: ""Estimates I hear as much as $50 to $55 billion more.""
 
Koppel: ""Over a course of how many years?""
 
McCain: ""Four or five years.""
 
Koppel never addresses the question of troops, deployments or withdrawal in this interview.
 
We looked for other McCain statements at this time, and found that in most cases he was actually urging the Bush administration to send more troops to Iraq to maintain order and security there. A few weeks before his interview with Koppel, a reporter on CNN asked him how long troops would have to be in Iraq to secure a true victory. McCain replied: ""I don't know, because I don't know how quickly we're going to act in the form of sending troops. I don't know how quickly we're going to be able to provide them with the security. So, it's sort of up to us.""
 
•

From MSNBC's ""Hardball,"" Feb. 25, 2004:

 
McCain: ""Listen, my friend, we're going to be there for five or six years.""
 
This exchange more fairly represents McCain's views, though his remarks aren't strictly about deployments. He seems to be more talking about how long troops will have to actively maintain order to help a newly formed government establish itself. After discussing that prospect, host Chris Matthews asked, ""What's the role of the U.S. military once we get a government out there?""
 
McCain: ""We'll still be there for security purposes. Listen, my friend, we're going to be there for five or six years. A little straight talk: We're going to have to be there for quite a while.""
 
Matthews: ""And we have to defend the government?""
 
McCain: ""We will try to maintain security. There's just too many bad elements both from outside and from within.""
 
•

From CBS News' ""The Early Show,"" Feb. 3, 2005:

 
McCain: ""If I had to guess, I would think that it's going to be at least another year to a year and a half...""
 
In this interview, Hannah Storm asks John McCain specifically about a withdrawal timetable. This snippet appears to be a fair presentation of McCain's views. Here's the fuller exchange:
 
Storm: ""What is a realistic timetable here? When would you like to see our troops leave?""
 
McCain: ""Tomorrow. But I think that if I had to guess, I would think that it's going to be at least another year to a year and a half. But hopefully before then we could have our troops out of a lot of the areas where they're vulnerable to casualties. And the Iraqi American-trained law enforcement--their armed forces with U.S. troops embedded in them -- could take over much more of the responsibilities. That will reduce the casualty levels. Let me just remind you, Hannah, we're got troops in Bosnia; we've got them in Kosovo; we've been in South Korea for 50 years. Americans are not upset about that. They're upset when young Americans are wounded and killed.""
 
Storm: ""So you're saying our troops could potentially be there for decades then, Senator?""
 
McCain: ""I don't think decades because I don't think that the Iraqis want American troops staying, but I think we'll be there for a while and the Iraqi government appreciates that as well.""
 
•

From NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" June 19, 2005.

 
McCain: ""I'd rather say two or three years, and be surprised a year from now.""
 
The questioning in this interview was about the training of Iraqi forces, not troop withdrawal. The time frame McCain mentions is when Iraqi troops will be fully trained, thought it's fair to say that the readiness of Iraqi troops is a pre-condition for U.S. withdrawal. Here's the full exchange between McCain and moderator Tim Russert.
 
Russert: ""Our only exit strategy is to have enough Iraqis who are willing to defend their country, spill their own blood, so that we can withdraw. How many security forces do you believe the Iraqis have right now that are fully capable of fighting and defending their nation?""
 
McCain: ""I don't know the answer. I know the number is increasing. … But I believe that there has been some improvement, and that improvement gives us, at least, some hope. Because, as you say, and everybody knows, the exit strategy from Iraq is not a time or a date. The exit strategy from Iraq is clearly the Iraqis being able to take over the responsibilities and the casualties, for policing and ensuring security in their own country. Look, nobody cares--in fact, I'm kind of glad that American troops are in South Korea. Why? Because there's no Americans in combat. So it's not a matter of time and date of withdrawal. It's a matter of Iraqis being able to assume the responsibilities for the security of their own nation. And, again, I think we should tell people it's not going to be a short--I'd rather say two or three years, and be surprised a year from now, than say, 'Everything's fine,' and then be disappointed a year or two from now.""

From a town hall meeting in Concord, N.H., Jan. 3, 2008:

 
Question: President Bush is talking about our staying in Iraq for 50 year...""
 
McCain: ""Maybe a hundred.""
 
We've looked at this claim previously; McCain's opponents have hammered him before for this statement, but its clear from the context that McCain is not urging a 100-year war. Rather, once combat ends and there are no more U.S. casualties, he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Japan. That presence could continue for many years, according to McCain.
 
Here's the full exchange McCain had with a voter at a town hall meeting:
 
Question: ""President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years — ""
 
McCain: ""Maybe a hundred.""
 
Question: ""Is that — ""
 
McCain: ""We've been in South Korea . . . we've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea for 50 years or so. That would be fine with me. As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, that's fine with me. I hope that would be fine with you, if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al Qaeda is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day.""
 
•

From a McCain speech on May 15, 2008:

 
McCain: ""By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly.""
 
This appears to be a fair representation of McCain's views; it comes from a major policy speech he gave on what he hopes to accomplish during a first term. Here's a longer excerpt on the portion of his speech about Iraq:
 
""By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom. The Iraq War has been won. Iraq is a functioning democracy, although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension. Violence still occurs, but it is spasmodic and much reduced. Civil war has been prevented; militias disbanded; the Iraqi Security Force is professional and competent; al Qaeda in Iraq has been defeated; and the Government of Iraq is capable of imposing its authority in every province of Iraq and defending the integrity of its borders. The United States maintains a military presence there, but a much smaller one, and it does not play a direct combat role.""
 
•

From NBC News' ""Today Show,"" June 11, 2008:

 
Question: ""Do you now have a better estimate of when American forces can come home from Iraq?""
 
McCain: ""No, but that's not too important.""
 
This is edited to seem like McCain doesn't care about when troops come home. But judging from what McCain said next, he meant it wasn't too important if troops were in Iraq as long as the fighting was over and there were few casualties. Here's McCain's complete answer:
 
""No. But that's not too important. What's important is the casualties in Iraq. Americans are in South Korea, Americans are in Japan, American troops are in Germany. That's all fine. American casualties and the ability to withdraw. We will be able to withdraw. General Petraeus is going to tell us in July when he thinks we are. But the key to it is we don't want any more Americans in harm's way. And that way they will be safe and serve our country, and come home with honor and victory, not in defeat, which is what Senator Obama's proposal would have done. And I'm proud of them and they're doing a great job, and we are succeeding. And it's fascinating that Senator Obama still doesn't realize that.""
 
So while the DNC ad gets some of its points accurate, it purposefully edits McCain's remarks to distort them in at least three instances (the Nightline interview, the ""100 years"" remark and the ""not too important remark""). Two of the instances (the ""Hardball"" interview and the ""Meet the Press"" interview) are borderline; his comments address issues that affect withdrawal but aren't precisely on point. Two instances (""The Early Show"" interview and McCain's speech) are fair and accurate representations of his views.
 
While the ad is right on two items, and partially right on two items, three of the quotes are out of context and distort McCain's original meaning. This weakens the DNC's case against McCain significantly. We rate the DNC's argument that McCain has given inconsistent and erratic answers on when troops should return from Iraq Barely True.

This dog won't hunt
","Sen. Barack Obama says the United States has its priorities about energy research all wrong: Case in point, the government spends less on energy research than the pet food industry does on its own research and development.
 
That's the claim Democratic nominee Obama makes in his ""Plan to Make America a Global Energy Leader,"" to explain why he wants to increase the amount the government spends on energy innovation.
 
""At present, the federal government spends over $3 billion per year on all energy innovation efforts,"" the Obama plan states. ""While this may seem like a significant sum, it is much less than what we spent in the late 1970s when adjusted for inflation, and is less than the pet food industry invests in its own products.""
 
A June 2008 Harvard study confirms that the part about the 1970s is true. In inflation-adjusted dollars, the government was spending more than $6 billion a year on energy research and development in the late 1970s, which is more than double what it's spending this year.
 
But that second claim? The pet food one? The Obama campaign declined to explain what the Illinois senator meant, exactly, by ""invests in its own products."" Instead, it referred Politifact to an August 2007 article by University of California (Berkeley) Professor Daniel M. Kammen, which makes precisely the same point Obama did: ""The federal government spends less on energy research and development than the U.S. pet food industry spends on its products in the United States,"" Kammen wrote.
 
The article, on global warming, contains no footnotes to support the pet food assertion, doesn't expand upon it beyond that one sentence, and Kammen did not respond to several requests for comment.
 
That forces us to take the Obama statement as any voter would: at face value. In his article, Kammen refers to pet food industry spending, which it could be argued, refers to everything the industry spends on its products, from raw materials to packaging to advertising.
 
But Obama uses the word ""invests"" – and given the parallel construction of his argument – it reads to us like a comparison between federal government energy research and pet food industry research, (i.e. the development of new products.)
 
For its part, the Pet Food Institute, the trade association for the industry, says that it doesn't keep such figures, leaving us to wonder where Kammen got them.
 
But a 2006 study by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, which examined the 1,000 companies across all industries that spend the most on research and development, found that on average those companies spent 3.8 percent of their gross sales on R&D.;
 
Given that the pet food industry as a whole grosses about $15 billion a year in sales, it's inconceivable that the industry spends more on new product research than the $3-billion the government spends on energy R&D.; That would be 20 percent of gross sales. As a result, we find Obama's claim to be False.

Thousands of ""green card"" soldiers in Iraq
","
Update: We originally addressed this when it was released as a web ad on Memorial Day. On July 11, the McCain campaign released the same video as a national television ad. Because it will be new to many people seeing it for the first time on television, we decided to re-post the item.
 
In a Web ad released on Memorial Day, Sen. John McCain praises the many Hispanic soldiers serving in the U.S. military, some of whom are not yet legal citizens of the United States.
 
""My friends, I want you, the next time you're down in Washington, D.C., to go to the Vietnam War Memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite,"" McCain begins. ""You'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names.
 
""When you go to Iraq or Afghanistan today, you're going to see a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background.
 
""You're even going to meet some of the few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country, who love this country so much that they're willing to risk their lives in its service in order to accelerate their path to citizenship and enjoy the bountiful, blessed nation.
 
""So let's, from time to time, remember that these are God's children. They must come into this country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them.""
 
We checked with the Defense Department to see how many noncitizens are serving in the U.S. military, and if McCain was accurate that there are thousands serving in Iraq or Afghanistan.
 
The short answer is that McCain is right.
 
As of Feb. 29, 2008, there were 20,328 noncitizens on active duty in the military (about 1.5 percent of the entire active military), according to a report provided by the Pentagon. Of those, 4,112 were serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, or in support of those operations elsewhere. There were another 2,236 whose citizenship was ""unknown.""
 
These are legal residents with green cards who have not yet become naturalized citizens. There are citizenship incentives for those who enlist. All immigrants who serve honorably in the military during wartime are eligible to file for immediate citizenship under special wartime provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
An analysis of the Pentagon report by PolitiFact determined that about a quarter of the ""green card"" soldiers are originally from Spanish-speaking countries. In addition, there are 10,533 naturalized citizens serving in the military who were born in Spanish-speaking countries.
 
The thousands of noncitizens serving in Iraq and Afghanistan is one of the military's little-known facts. But apparently not to McCain. We rate his statement True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
Obama shifts emphasis on Iraq but not position
","The day before the Fourth of July weekend, Barack Obama talked about the likelihood that he will soon travel to Iraq and what it means for his foreign policy.
 
""I've always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability. That assessment has not changed,"" he said. ""And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground, I'm sure I'll have more information and will continue to refine my policies.""
 
The John McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee pounced on those comments, charging Obama with flip-flopping.
 
""Since announcing his campaign in 2007, the central premise of Barack Obama's candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately,"" said Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman. ""Today, Barack Obama reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter. He has now adopted John McCain's position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in Iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground.""
 
""There appears to be no issue that Barack Obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience,"" said Alex Conant, a spokesman for the national Republican Party. ""Obama's Iraq problem undermines the central premise of his candidacy and shows him to be a typical politician.""
 
We reviewed Obama's statements on Iraq from the campaign to try to uncover whether he was back-tracking on earlier promises. Iraq was one of the most pressing issues of the Democratic primary, discussed and dissected during more than 20 debates.
 
We found that Obama has made a few points about Iraq over and over again: that he opposed the war ""from the start""; that U.S. troops should leave Iraq quickly and in an orderly fashion (""as careful getting out as we were careless getting in""); and that the U.S. should not have permanent bases inside Iraq.
 
How quickly should troops leave? His campaign Web site says the following: ""Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. Obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in Iraq. He will keep some troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats; if al Qaeda attempts to build a base within Iraq, he will keep troops in Iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al Qaeda.""
 
The McCain campaign and the RNC have pointed to the ""16 months"" statement as an indication that Obama favors a ""precipitous withdrawal"", presumably as early as the middle of 2010. (We checked

that claim earlier here

and found it Half True.) They also point to a March 2008 statement from Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe.
 
""On Iraq, he has been very clear,"" Plouffe said in March 2008. ""He offered a withdrawal plan well over a year ago. It's essential to his candidacy and a rock-solid commitment. ... It will be 16 months at the most where you can withdraw combat troops.""
 
Plouffe's statement appears to be the best evidence to support the McCain campaign's argument. Plouffe was responding to comments from former Obama adviser Samantha Power, who had said the 16-month timeframe was a ""best-case scenario"" that Obama wouldn't necessarily follow once he was in office. Power was forced to resign after calling Hillary Clinton a ""monster.""
 
But does this mean a sixteen-month clock starts ticking the moment Obama enters office? We could not find a direct statement from Obama saying that, and found statements he made throughout the campaign that contradicted that.
 
For example:
 
• At a Democratic debate in Hanover, N.H. on Sept. 26, 2007, the late Tim Russert pressed Obama as to whether he would have all troops out by the end of his first term. ""I think it's hard to project four years from now, and I think it would be irresponsible. We don't know what contingency will be out there,"" Obama said. ""I will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy, protecting our civilians and making sure that we're carrying out counterterrorism activities there. I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out.""
 
• At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, Obama said, ""As soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed.""
 
• At a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said, ""Now, I will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics. Once I've given them a new mission, that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of Iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out, we will not have permanent bases there, once I've provided that mission, if they come to me and want to adjust tactics, then I will certainly take their recommendations into consideration; but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief.""
 
• On ""Meet the Press"" on May 4, 2008, Russert asked Obama what he would do if advisers thought ""a quick withdrawal"" from Iraq would result in genocide. Obama replied, ""Of course, I would factor in the possibilities of genocide, and I factored it in when I said that I would begin a phased withdrawal. What we have talked about is a very deliberate and prudent approach to the withdrawal -- one to two brigades per month. At that pace, it would take about 16 months, assuming that George Bush is not going to lower troop levels before the next president takes office. We are talking about, potentially, two years away. At that point, we will have been in Iraq seven years. If we cannot get the Iraqis to stand up in seven years, we're not going to get them to stand up in 14 or 28 or 56 years.""
 
Taken in their entirety, Obama's comments reflect a philosophy of ""about 16 months"" for withdrawal. He also appears to be willing to take advice from commanders on the ground that might affect the general pace, but not the overall goal of withdrawal. Yet Obama has been artful in his rhetoric. His campaign has clearly emphasized ""16 months"" when speaking to anti-war audiences and ""

about

16 months"" when answering questions from withdrawal skeptics. But Obama never urged a ""precipitous"" withdrawal; even a bill he offered in January 2007 that set a deadline for getting out of Iraq contained an exemption for national security.
 
The Plouffe statement, however, stands out. Plouffe said the 16-month time frame was a ""rock solid commitment."" But it's the only statement we found that supports the idea of withdrawal with no allowances made for circumstances on the ground.
 
After the McCain campaign attacked Obama as a flip-flopper, the candidate responded with another press conference the same day.
 
""I intend to end this war,"" Obama said. ""My first day in office I will bring the joint chiefs of staff in, and I will give them a new mission. And that is to end this war. Responsibly, deliberately, but decisively. And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month. And again, that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months' time.""
 
Weighing all these statements together, we find the McCain campaign is off-base in saying Obama has changed position. Obama repeatedly said facts on the ground could affect the tactical moves of an overall withdrawal. Obama's position was not an iron-clad withdrawal timeline in the first place. We find the McCain campaign's statement that Obama has reversed position to be False.

Big oil, like all companies, would get tax break
","A new TV ad from the Obama campaign called ""New Energy"" takes three swipes at John MCain.
 
We've addressed two of them previously at PolitiFact: that McCain voted with President Bush 95 percent of the time; and that McCain's plan to open up offshore drilling wouldn't result in oil production for at least seven years.
 
Here we will focus on an attack in the ad that has become a common jab in Obama's stump speeches: ""McCain will give more tax breaks to big oil.""
 
If you read the small print at the bottom of the ad, it cites a March 27, 2008 report from the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The report is titled ""The McCain Plan to Cut Oil Company Taxes by Nearly $4 Billion.""
 
Here's how the think tank - which is headed by former Clinton chief of staff John D. Podesta - arrived at its headline. McCain has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent to make U.S. corporations more competitive.
 
Says the McCain campaign Web site: ""John McCain believes the taxes we impose on American companies should be no higher than the average rate our major trading partners impose on theirs. We currently have the second-highest combined corporate-tax rate in the industrialized world, and it is driving many businesses and the jobs they create overseas.""
 
The Center for American Progress Action Fund grabbed the five largest U.S. oil companies from Fortune Magazine's list of the Fortune 50. Then they obtained financial statements for those five companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission and listed the reported current and deferred taxes paid in 2007 to the federal government for income earned from U.S. operations. Based on those figures, they calculated how much less those companies would pay if the corporate tax rate were dropped from 35 percent to 25 percent. The total savings to the five oil companies, $3.8 billion; $1.2 billion Exxon Mobil alone.
 
Obama cited these same numbers in a speech on June 24th, 2008, in Las Vegas.
 
""He's willing to spend nearly $4 billion on more tax breaks for big oil companies,"" Obama said, ""including $1.2 billion for Exxon alone.""
 
Obama is cherry-picking here. The corporate tax rate reduction would apply to ALL corporations. Yes, Exxon Mobil, but also to Wal-Mart, General Motors and Home Depot, to name a few of the other Fortune 50 biggies. Even everybody's favorite, Starbucks, would get the same tax break.
 
Obama's statement is technically true, but singling out oil companies suggests McCain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks. He hasn't. We rate Obama's statement, and the claim in the ad, Barely True.
 
As for the other two claims in the ad:
 
* ""McCain and Bush support a drilling plan that won't produce a drop of oil for seven years.""
 
We addressed

this before

in PolitiFact, finding that most oil experts say if the U.S. pursued oil drilling in prohibited offshore areas, as McCain has proposed, it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant oil production. McCain has even acknowledged that fact himself, saying in a June 23 town hall meeting in Fresno, Ca., ""Even though it may take some years, the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that I think is beneficial.""
 
* McCain has ""voted with Bush 95 percent of the time.""
 
We've also dealt with

this claim previously

and concluded that it accurately reflects a 2007 ""presidential support"" score from Congressional Quarterly.

McCain's argument tangential at best
","As political attacks go, this one is about as well-worn as they get.
 
I, the Republican, will cut your taxes. He, the Democrat, will raise your taxes.
 
Such was the gist of a speech Sen. John McCain made in a town hall meeting in Denver on July 7.
 
""If you have an investment for your child's education or own a mutual fund or a stock in a retirement plan, he (Obama) is going to raise your taxes.""
 
This statement is based on Obama's plan to raise the long-term capital gains tax from the current rate of 15 percent to as high as 28 percent (Obama has not been specific about the rate he'll seek). It's part of Obama's strategy to shift more of the tax burden to wealthy people.
 
But according to the McCain campaign, Obama's plan would hit the middle class. What's interesting about McCain's statement is that it's so specific; retirement plans, investments for education. For most people, those investments are made in tax sheltered plans, such as 401Ks or 529 plans for college funds.
 
The McCain explanation is that Obama's tax plan would have a broad effect on investing, essentially taxing everything.
 
""Obama has pledged to raise capital taxes - on capital gains and dividends - potentially impacting tens of millions of Americans,"" said Brian Rogers, a spokesman for the McCain campaign. ""All investors would face the impact of higher capital taxes on the valuation of their investments. While those in non-tax preferred accounts may not immediately be affected by capital gains and dividend tax hikes, funds ultimately withdrawn from tax-deferred accounts are subject to taxation as ordinary income -- on which Senator Obama has also pledged to raise the top marginal rate.""
 
To support the argument, the McCain campaign points to some statistics: That 52% of American adults own stocks, and that in 2006, 8.5 million of them paid a capital gains tax. McCain's campaign also notes an Investment Company Institute survey that concluded 88 million people invested in the stock market through mutual funds.
 
Lastly, they point to a report from the Joint Committee On Taxation that found in 2005, about 20 percent of the taxpayers who were expected to report capital gains income - and 24 percent of those expected to report dividend income - earned less than $50,000 annually.
 
These statistics ignore a very important caveat Obama has included in his tax plan, his unequivocal pledge that he will not raise capital gains taxes (or any other taxes) for families making less than $250,000 a year.
 
""A lot of what (McCain campaign people) are saying is noise,"" said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C.
 
Those statistics on the large percentages of Americans who hold stocks and pay capital gains taxes are accurate, Toder said, they just aren't relevant to the argument. Yes, he said, there are 88 million people who have invested money in the stock market but ""not too many of them are making $250,000 a year."" So the higher rates in Obama's plan wouldn't apply to them.
 
""I would say this stuff is, at best, misleading,"" Toder said.
 
Toder also said that if McCain is talking about traditional college savings plans, like a 529, then he's ""just wrong.""
 
The Obama campaign argues that not only is McCain wrong, they say that Obama is proposing some tax relief on those very fronts. Obama's plan calls for a fully refundable $4,000 college tax credit; and a 50% match of the first $1,000 of retirement savings you do each year.
 
There is another school of thought on this issue, in support of the McCain campaign's argument, that raising capital gains and dividend tax rates will harm the value of stocks in general, and discourage investing in the long term.
 
That may not translate to a direct tax on an individual, said Patrick Fleenor, chief economist for the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group, but the effect is the same. Any stock portfolio, whether it's earmarked for a child's education expenses or retirement, or anything, is going to suffer, he said.
 
""The underlying value of the fund would be lower,"" Fleenor said. ""To economists, there's no difference.""
Even if you agree with this argument, that's not what McCain said. He said if you have an investment for your child's education, or own a mutual fund or stock in a retirement plan ""he (Obama) is going to raise your taxes.""
 
The fact is the capital gains tax would have absolutely no direct effect on savings in a traditional college savings plan. As for retirement savings through stocks or a mutual funds, people who cash out would not face higher tax rates unless you make more than $250,000. That doesn't apply to most Americans. We rate McCain's statement False.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Barack Obama']","
No shortage of choppers for floods
","In a news conference in Chicago, Sen. Barack Obama took a question about whether ""a terror attack might be good for Senator John McCain's campaign.""
 
The theory behind the question was that McCain is a military veteran who has spent his decades in Washington developing strong foreign policy credentials. Obama answered by arguing that the policies supported by McCain and President Bush have actually made the country more vulnerable to attack:
 
""I don't think that the Bush administration or John McCain have shaped policies that are optimal in order to deal with the terrorist threat. We're seeing backsliding in Afghanistan. We've got bin Laden sending out audio tapes. We've got interactive Internet sites that al-Qaida has put up because they've got a place where they feel relatively secure. We are weakened financially and our military is strained to the breaking point as a consequence of our incursions into Iraq. We've neglected some of the homeland security investments that we could have made here.
 
""Our National Guard, as we saw in the Midwest flooding, can't function as effectively as it could. I was talking to National Guard representatives. Fifteen of their 17 helicopters in this region were overseas during the flooding.""
 
Obama was making two points about the Guard: First, that the strain on the Guard from fighting two foreign wars hampered its response to the June Midwest flooding; second, that the number of helicopters overseas at the time supports that conclusion.
 
We didn't find evidence that either of these points were true. Three states affected by the flooding said his math is incorrect on the number of helicopters available to work flooding missions. Only one state had more helicopters slotted for overseas work than domestic missions. The Obama campaign didn't specify what region the candidate was referring to or where he got his information, but it acknowledged that the helicopter figure was wrong.
 
• In Iowa, the state worst hit by the flooding, all 21 of its helicopters were stateside and available to help with the flooding.
 
The figures for manpower show the Iowa National Guard was ready to respond as well. At the time of the flooding, about 850 service men and women were overseas. That's less than one-tenth of the state's total forces of 9,400.
 
""We had what we needed to get the job done,"" said Lt. Col. Greg Hapgood, a Guard spokesman. ""If we needed more people we had more to call up.""
 
Before and during the flooding, service members returned from Iraq. Now, Iowa has about 560 serving on active duty, and the majority of those aren't involved in the war on terrorism. About 330 are on a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, about 140 are in Iraq and 90 on the Sinai Peninsula, Hapgood said.
 
• Missouri National Guard spokeswoman Capt. Tammy Spicer said the Missouri Guard has 10 Black Hawk helicopters that are on their way to Iraq. That leaves them with eight choppers to work the flooding.
 
""Every request for aviation support that has been passed to the Missouri National Guard for this particular disaster has been met,"" Spicer said. Kansas had offered aviation support, but Missouri didn't need it.
 
For personnel, the Missouri Guard has 11,500 soldiers and airmen, about 1,800 of which are mobilized for the war on terrorism. The largest number, about 1,000, are in Kosovo, followed by Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
• Mike Chrisman, spokesman for the Illinois National Guard, said eight of the state's eighteen helicopters are overseas in Kosovo. They've been using only three of the available helicopters for flooding missions. And the helicopters that are overseas aren't even in Iraq.
 
""We've had the assets,"" Chrisman said. ""We would have had more had they asked for more.""
 
Illinois has about 13,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen, with about 800 in Iraq and Afghanistan. Later this year, about 2,700 National Guard soldiers will deploy to Afghanistan, the state's biggest overseas deployment since World War II.
 
Still, the flooding required only about 1,400 soldiers.
 
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama, conceded in an e-mail that the 15 out of 17 figure on helicopters was inaccurate, but he did not provide more specifics on where the information came from.
 
""The exact data point on helicopters that was relayed to Senator Obama was off, but the sentiment behind his statement was correct – that the Iraq war is overstretching our national guard,"" Vietor wrote.
 
We're not sure exactly what ""region"" Obama was referring to, but the numbers for the states affected by flooding don't match up at all. We understand Obama's larger point,

and explore it in this story about the readiness of the National Guard.

But he chose a terrible example in the Midwest floods to illustrate that larger point. The fact is his facts wrong, so we say False.

"['National', 'Guns', 'John McCain']","
Obama consistently on the fence
","When it comes to gun control issues, there is clear separation between John McCain and Barack Obama.
 
So when on June 26 the Supreme Court made one of the most important gun rulings in decades - concluding that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm and that the Washington DC gun ban is unconstitutional - one naturally expected contrasting opinions from the political rivals.
 
Instead, they acted like opposing boxers who both raise their arms in victory after the final bell.
 
McCain quickly pronounced it ""a landmark victory for Second Amendment freedom."" McCain noted that while he was among a bipartisan (though mostly Republican) group of congressmen who signed a ""friend of the court"" brief arguing against the DC law, Obama did not.
 
""Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness,"" McCain stated, ""today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right -- sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly.""
 
That was a dig at Obama for his heavily scrutinized statement about people living in struggling rural towns. He said it was ""not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion...as a way to explain their frustrations.""
 
But when Obama issued a statement an hour after McCain's, he said the Supreme Court ruling affirmed what he has been saying all along.
 
""I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms, but I also identify with the need for crime-ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common-sense, effective safety measures. The Supreme Court has now endorsed that view, and while it ruled that the D.C. gun ban went too far, Justice Scalia himself acknowledged that this right is not absolute and subject to reasonable regulations enacted by local communities to keep their streets safe. Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country.""
 
The McCain campaign responded by accusing Obama of waffling on the issue.
 
""Throughout his time in elected office, Barack Obama has taken multiple positions on banning handguns and the D.C. handgun ban. He has stated his belief that handgun bans were constitutional and he supported them. Then he actually refused to state a position.""
 

Silent on the DC ban

 
In the months leading up to the Supreme Court decision, Obama did, in fact, skirt the issue of whether he though the DC gun ban was constitutional. Instead, he repeatedly said he believed the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to bear arms, but that it does not preclude local governments from enacting ""common sense"" laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.
 
The main issue before the Supreme Court was whether the second Amendment protected an individual right to possess a firearm, or whether it only protected possession of a firearms connected to service in a militia.
 
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it was an individual right.
 
Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Center and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says the Supreme Court ended up right where Obama was.
 
""Obama has said pretty consistently that he felt the second amendment provided an individual right to own a gun,"" he said.
 
That position was at odds with the Brady Center's position - which it submitted to the Supreme Court - that the Second Amendment only guaranteed the rights of gun ownership for militias.
 
""We lost,"" Helmke said.
 

McCain's case against Obama

 
But the McCain campaign says Obama has waffled, that he has supported the DC gun ban in the past. They provide three main pieces of evidence:
 
* The first is a 1996 voter questionnaire Obama completed while running for a seat in the Illinois senate. The ""Independent Voters of Illinois"" asked if the candidate supported state legislation to ""ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns."" Obama's answer: ""Yes.""
 
The 1996 voter form surfaced again last year. The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who ""unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position."" The Web site Politico.com investigated and found that while Obama's campaign claimed Obama never saw or approved the responses in the questionnaire, the campaign at the time filed an amended version, which appeared to include Obama's own handwritten notes added to one answer (not the one on gun control).
 
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama's campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, ""He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn't change the fact that some answers didn't reflect his views.""
 
• The second alleged contradiction comes from a Chicago Tribune article on Nov. 20, 2007 in which the Obama campaign is quoted as saying Obama ""believes that we can recognize and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and the right of local communities to enact common sense laws to combat violence and save lives. Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constitutional.""
 
The statement, which came from an unnamed campaign aide ""was obviously an inartful attempt to explain the Senator's consistent position,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton told ABC News.
 
• Lastly, the McCain campaign notes that in a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008, Obama did not dispute a questioner's characterization of Obama's position as supporting the DC handgun ban.
 
Here's the text of the exchange:
 
Leon Harris of WJLA: ""One other issue that is of great importance to the people of the district here, is gun control. You said in Idaho here, recently, that ""I have no intention of taking away folks' guns."" But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you've said that it's constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?""
 
Obama responded, ""Because I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it's important for us to recognize that we've got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people – law-abiding citizens use if for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for protecting their families. We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage. And so I think there is nothing wrong with a community saying, we are going to take those illegal handguns off the streets, we are going to trace more effectively how these guns are ending up on the streets, to unscrupulous gun dealers, who often times are selling to straw purchasers, and cracking down on the various loopholes that exist in terms of background checks for children, the mentally ill...We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measure that I think respect the Second Amendment and people's traditions.""
 

A look at the votes

 
The National Rifle Association isn't buying Obama's ""election-year rhetoric"" in support of individuals' right to keep and bear arms.
 
The NRA says Obama's voting record -which they have consistently rated an ""F"" - suggests he would be ""a serious threat to Second Amendment liberties.""
 
Here's some of Obama's voting record:
 
As a state senator in Illinois in 2004, Obama voted against a measure to lower the minimum age to apply for a Firearm Owner's Identification Card from 21 to 18. That same year, an Illinois state senator proposed giving people who violate city gun bans the right to use self-defense as a legal argument if they were charged for violating a ban. Obama opposed the measure.
 
As a U.S. Senator, Obama voted in July 2005 against a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers or dealers resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRA contended the bill was designed to bankrupt the firearms industry. McCain voted in favor of the prohibition, which passed 65-31.
 
Obama also voted for an amendment to expand the definition of prohibited, armor-piercing ammunition. The NRA claimed it would have banned much of the rifle ammunition commonly used for hunting. McCain voted against it and it failed.
 
Both Obama and McCain voted in favor of a requirement that manufacturers and importers of handguns provide child safety locks.
 
In 2006, both Obama and McCain voted for an amendment to prohibit the confiscation of a lawfully owned firearm during an emergency or major disaster.
 
According to Obama's campaign Web site, Obama supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent, ""as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets."" McCain has voted against the assault weapons ban.
 
There's no question McCain has taken a far more conservative line on gun ownership.
 
But he hasn't always been a darling of the NRA. Although for years McCain enjoyed an A rating from the NRA, in 2004, the NRA gave McCain just a C+. The drop was based largely on two votes the NRA did not agree with: one in favor of instant background checks at gun shows (McCain even cut TV ads lobbying for it); and McCain's campaign finance reform legislation, which the NRA viewed as an attempt to stifle its voice.
 
Since 2004, Parsons said, McCain has voted 100 percent in line with the NRA.
 

On the fence

 
So here's what we have to support the claim of an Obama flip-flop: one answer to a questionnaire in 1996 that Obama claims was completed in error by a staffer; a quote attributed to a campaign aide in 2007, also later disavowed by Obama; and failing to dispute the characterization of his position in a campaign forum in February.
 
It's a bit too convenient for the Obama campaign to dismiss a record it doesn't like by claiming that twice in his career aides misstated his position on gun control. At the end of the day, voters simply have to decide if they believe Obama's explanation or they don't.
 
Finally, there's the question in the forum in which Obama's position was characterized as supporting the DC gun ban, and that it was constitutional.
 
Obama's answer seemed like an attempt to cling to his position atop the fence, repeating his belief that the Second Amendment affirms an individual's right to own a gun, but that local governments ought to be able to limit that right.
 
But what about DC's outright ban of guns? Obama not only didn't correct Harris' characterization of support for the DC gun ban, his answer seemed to affirm that it was accurate. At the very least, if Harris was wrong, here was the perfect opportunity to set the record straight.
 
By and large, Obama's fence-sitting has been pretty consistent. Still, twice claiming an aide botched your position and failing to go on record even when directly asked about it gives the McCain campaign enough ammo to merit a Half True.
