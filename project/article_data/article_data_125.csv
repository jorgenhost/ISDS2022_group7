Fox Business pundit: 'No good data' for deaths from secondhand smoke
","All those warnings you heard about secondhand smoke from your mother, federal government PSAs and school D.A.R.E. instructors? Bogus, a Fox Business host claimed recently. In a discussion about waning personal freedom in the free world, pundit John Stossel went off about the onslaught of government rules and regulations telling Americans what they can do and when, where and how they can do it. He used cigarette-smoking as an example, arguing that business owners should have the right to allow smoking in their bars or restaurants even where ordinances or laws ban the practice. ""Yeah, they kill smokers,"" Stossel said on Fox & Friends of cigarettes. ""But there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people."" A Fox spokeswoman did not return our inquiry, and Stossel, who has long questioned the lethal nature of secondhand smoke, did not reply to emails and tweets. (The exchange in question was a follow-up to a Dec. 4 segment on his Thursday show, when he said, ""the secondhand smoke scare turns out to be bunk. But the smokers still take it."") Stossel’s definition of ""good"" might be different than ours, but there is plenty of scientific research and consensus that secondhand smoke does indeed kill people. Secondhand smoke is a mixture of smoke emitted from the burning end of a cigarette or other tobacco products and what’s exhaled by smokers. It’s regarded as a cancer-causing agent, a ""known human carcinogen"" (a healthful classification, that is not). The government has campaigned for tough anti-smoking policies in public places and workplaces as a way to protect Americans from secondhand smoke, saying there is no safe level of exposure. Reports from the country’s top doctors say these laws are reducing risk. The U.S. surgeon general has released 31 reports about the effects of smoking since 1964. These reports are extremely detailed, summarizing the latest research on smoking and peer-reviewed by dozens of the nation’s top scientists. Consensus on secondhand smoke really began to form in the 1980s, even as the tobacco industry’s""doubt-creation machine"" spun opposing talking points, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, senior scientific editor of the 2014 surgeon general report and director of the University of Southern California’s Institute for Global Health. The surgeon general’s 2006 report stated rather bluntly that inhaling secondhand smoke ""causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in nonsmoking adults."" Involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke killed more than 49,000 nonsmokers in 2005, plus 430 newborns who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the report said. In 2014, the acting surgeon general released a new report, one that factored in input from more than 80 contributing authors and 150 reviewers who are experts in medicine and public health. Secondhand smoke can also increase risk of stroke, the new report found. Beyond that, involuntary exposure poses significant problems for children, worsening asthma and leading to other respiratory conditions. Since 1964, the report said, 2.46 million non-smokers have died from exposure to secondhand smoke. How does the government calculate its numbers? Scientists don’t keep a count of deaths by secondhand smoke as recorded in death certificates. (Death certificates don’t list ""secondhand smoke"" as a cause of death.) Instead, they rely on statistical methods used by epidemiologists, who are experts in disease patterns within populations. To figure out lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke, for instance, the individual risk of lung cancer is analyzed next to the proportion of people exposed to secondhand smoke. It’s a complicated statistical analysis (page 659 explains more), one with which Stossel obviously finds fault. But it’s not unusual. The same method is used to attribute the number of deaths from obesity through diabetes, for example, Samet said. ""This is the basic way to use to understand how the disease is exposed to this risk,"" Samet said. ""We understand that there are uncertainties that go with this, but this is a very basic tool. ... The approach here is embedded in science and policy and understanding how much a disease is caused by something."" The surgeon general is not alone in major scientific organizations linking secondhand smoke with deadly diseases. There’s also the World Health Organization’s International Center for Research on Cancer, the Environmental Protection Agency, the American Cancer Society, and the National Academy of Sciences. ""At this point, the evidence is firm and very powerful, and important conclusions have been reached,"" Samet said. You can quibble over specific numbers since they’re approximations, said Gary Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. But not that secondhand smoke kills, he said. ""Chronic exposure produces disease and death,"" Giovino said. How do folks such as Stossel respond? The libertarian Cato Institute published a response to the 2006 surgeon general’s report on secondhand smoke that highlighted testimony before a committee of the British Parliament by Oxford epidemiologist Richard Peto. Peto, who has studied the causes of cancer and the effects of smoking, testified that he could not quantify deaths from secondhand smoke because ""these hazards cannot be directly measured."" (The story was written by Gio Gori, an epidemiologist who wrote publications on behalf of the industry-backed Tobacco Institute refuting studies about nicotine’s harmful effects.) Conversely, some scientists say the government is actually undercounting secondhand smoke-related deaths. ""The criticism … is not that they overestimate the risk, it’s that they’re underestimating it,""  said Stanton Glantz, a University of California San Francisco medicine professor and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. And dog lovers, beware: New evidence shows secondhand smoke can also kill pets, including lung and nasal cancer in dogs and malignant lymphoma in cats. Our ruling Stossel said ""there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people."" His definition of good obviously differs with the vast majority of scientists and researchers studying the effects of secondhand smoke. They say the data does show that secondhand smoke kills people. And that the data is indeed solid. Stossel’s claim rates False.",/factchecks/2014/dec/11/john-stossel/fox-business-pundit-no-good-data-deaths-secondhand/

Adler says Mike Martinez voted to raise taxes and utility rates, also ending free buses for seniors
","Austin voters should doubt mayoral aspirant Mike Martinez’s commitment to an affordable city, his opponent in a Dec. 16, 2014, runoff maintains. The narrator of a Steve Adler TV ad says that as an Austin City Council member, Mike Martinez ""has voted to raise taxes and utility rates while ending free bus service for seniors."" That statement is made against this visual backdrop:  Source: TV ad from Steve Adler, Austin mayoral candidate, ""Mike Martinez Record on City Council,"" posted online Dec. 2, 2014. Martinez has been a council member since June 2006. So it’s no surprise he would have had a say on taxes and rates charged by the city-owned utilities, though unsaid here is that no single council member controls any such decisions; it’s been a seven-member body, including the mayor. Martinez also chairs the eight-person board overseeing Capital Metro, which provides local bus and limited rail service. So he could have voted on fares charged the elderly. Let’s recap Martinez’s actions on fares, city taxes and utility rates. Bus fares To our inquiries, Adler’s campaign didn’t provide comprehensive backup for his ad claim. But by email, spokesman Jim Wick pointed out a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman news story stating the Cap Metro board voted to require bus riders 65 and older to pay 50 cents a ride or $15 for a 31-day bus pass, starting in 2011. The story also said the board was deciding to charge seniors and people with disabilities to ride buses for the first time since 1989. For Capital Metro, spokeswoman Francine Pares told us by email Martinez has been a board member since June 2007 and chairman since January 2010. Pares also confirmed the board’s decision to charge the 50-cent fares, though she said that change was adopted at the board’s November 2010 gathering, which Martinez didn’t attend, she said. According to minutes of the Nov. 10, 2010, board meeting, the six members who were there unanimously approved a resolution authorizing higher fares in part, the resolution said, to generate additional operating revenues ""while striving to meet growing demand for transportation options."" Martinez and another board member were recorded as absent. Pares told us the board in September 2013 approved another increase in senior fares, to 60 cents, effective in 2015. Generally, she said, senior citizens receive 50 percent off regular fares. By phone, Martinez agreed he and fellow board members agreed to charge the fares for elderly residents. But that happened, he said, only after a state panel issued ""marching orders"" including a recommendation calling for Capital Metro to raise more money from fares. In a 2010 report, the staff of the Sunset Advisory Commission recommended the authority charge a bus fare of 50 cents for groups currently riding free. The commission had said 30 percent of Capital Metro’s passengers were riding for free and, it noted, the board had rejected proposed fares in 2008 and 2009. In its final July 2011 report on Capital Metro, the commission said: ""While fare increases are difficult, requiring only a portion of its ridership to bear the burden of these increases is not equitable or sustainable, especially in bad financial times."" Martinez pointed out the sunset review occurred in keeping with legislation passed into law by the 2009 Legislature, which wanted Capital Metro to get its finances in order. City taxes On taxes, Wick of Adler’s camp offered as backup news stories indicating that in 2009, Martinez said taxpayers would have to pay ""a little more"" in taxes and fees through 2010 to maintain services and in 2010, the council acting to raise the city’s property tax rate from 42.09 cents per $100 of property value to 45.71 cents; the city tax on a median value home was expected to increase $52 to $843. Wick followed up by emailing us a chart made by Adler’s campaign indicating city property taxes on a median-valued home going up on Martinez’s watch. For a non-campaign analysis, we turned to the Travis Central Appraisal District; the chief appraiser, Marya Crigler, emailed us a chart indicating city property taxes on a median-value homestead in 2007 were $715; in 2014, the comparable figure was $1,014. We converted the 2007 figure to 2014 dollars, using a federal inflation calculator. Upshot: Adjusted for inflation, city taxes on a median-value Austin homestead went up $278, or 34 percent, from 2007 through 2014, Martinez’s council years. Over those years, according to the district, the median taxable value of an Austin homestead went from $177,257 to $228,032. Adjusting for inflation suggests there was a nearly $18,800, 9 percent, increase. Martinez agreed property owners paid more in taxes in his council tenure, results influenced by surging property values, he said. Still, he said, in five of eight years, council members voted to keep the city’s property tax rate the same or to lower it. When the rate was raised, he said, the economy was in recession. For another fact check, the city provided this chart of tax rates, which shows the council raised the rate three times in Martinez’s tenure, most recently for 2013,  but cut the rate four times, most recently for 2014. In September 2014, the council left the 2014 rate intact for 2015.  Utility rates In 2011, we found Mostly True a claim that Austin Energy, the city electric utility, was considering its first hike in rates since 1994. The base electric rate, covering staff, the electric system, power plants, vehicles and the like, hadn’t changed since 1994. Meantime, residential customers were paying less for electricity than they once had, taking inflation into account. On June 7, 2012, the council unanimously voted to raise the base rate, the American-Statesman reported. The news story said: ""The complicated new rate structure will hit customers in different ways; generally speaking, the larger and more energy-hungry the home, the higher the percentage increase,"" effective October 2012. ""A typical home, which uses an average of 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month over the course of a year, will see its monthly bill rise by $8, to $113, according to Austin Energy calculations. A home that uses a lot of electricity would see its monthly bill increase by $59, to $332,"" the story said. How would Adler have voted? We asked Wick how Adler would have voted on the bus fares, tax and utility rate hikes we confirmed. There’s no simple answer, Wick said by email, but Adler favors free fares for senior citizens. Our ruling Mike ""Martinez has voted to raise taxes and utility rates while ending free bus service for seniors."" Austin residents pay more in taxes and could be paying more for electricity thanks to council actions Martinez supported. He also backed a decision by the Capital Metro board to charge half fares to elderly bus riders who had previously not been charged, though Martinez hardly did this by himself; it’s worth clarifying, too, that Capital Metro was under pressure to improve its finances and that Martinez missed the vote creating the then-50-cent fare. We rate this statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Marco Rubio says committee's torture report failed to include interviews of CIA officials
","In a preemptive strike to a Senate committee report detailing past examples of alleged torture by the CIA, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio called the release of the document ""reckless and irresponsible."" Rubio raised concerns that the release could endanger lives of Americans overseas, incite violence and create problems for our allies. ""The one-sided report that will be released by Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cost U.S. taxpayers over $40 million dollars to produce, and its authors never interviewed a single CIA official,"" Rubio wrote in a statement with Sen. Jim. Risch, R-Idaho, on Dec. 8. The report garnered widespread media coverage upon its release. But did the authors really fail to interview a single CIA official? We took a closer look. CIA torture report drew from inspector general interviews On Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIA’s interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11 that had been years in the making. About 500 pages of the 6,700 page report were made public. The report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as ""rectal rehydration"" and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes. Rubio has a point that the committee did not conduct face-to-face interviews with CIA employees and contractors. Here’s how the report addresses that point: ""CIA employees and contractors who would otherwise have been interviewed by the committee staff were under potential legal jeopardy, and therefore the CIA would not compel its workforce to appear before the committee."" But there are two wrinkles. First, then-CIA Director Michael Hayden -- whose tenure started in 2006 years after the interrogation techniques under scrutiny started -- testified in a closed-door session before the committee in 2007, though the committee deemed the testimony less than entirely helpful. A 38-page appendix in the report -- ""Example of Inaccurate CIA Testimony to the Committee April 12, 2007"" -- shows how Hayden’s testimony conflicted with CIA records on multiple points including the number of detainees, the information gleaned from them and interrogation tactics used. For example, Hayden suggested that the CIA interrogation program was successful in obtaining intelligence from all detainees. But the report counters, ""CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports."" The second problem with Rubio’s claim is that the report did draw from existing interviews of CIA officials, not to mention ""more than six million pages of CIA materials,"" including ""operational cables, intelligence reports, internal memoranda and emails, briefing materials"" and other records. Specifically, the committee had access to interviews of CIA officials that had been conducted by the CIA's inspector general, as well as the CIA’s oral history program. A background document provided by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the committee’s chair, stated, ""These documents included summaries of more than 100 CIA inspector general interviews with extensive quotations, as well as CIA cables, emails, letters, briefing notes, intelligence products, classified testimony, and other records. Of particular value were the interview summaries, which included responses to many of the questions the committee would have asked had the committee been able to conduct its own interviews."" The interview reports and transcripts included former CIA director George Tenet; Jose Rodriguez, director of the CIA’s counterterrorism center, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller; CIA Deputy Director of Operations James Pavitt; CIA Acting General Counsel John Rizzo; CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin; and a variety of interrogators, lawyers, medical personnel, senior counterterrorism analysts and managers of the detention and interrogation program, according to Feinstein. Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said the senator didn’t count Hayden’s interview because it pre-dated the 2009 start of work on the report. ""Any appearance before that was simply the CIA director appearing before the oversight committee,"" told PolitiFact. As for the transcripts of prior interviews, Sammon echoed a point in the Republicans’ minority report that argues that transcripts of interviews done by the inspector general aren’t the same as if the committee had done their own, fresh interviews. The minority report criticizes the study for ""failure to interview the relevant intelligence officers"" and argues that it led to ""significant analytical and factual errors."" Republicans withdrew their participation in the study in 2009 when Attorney General Eric Holder decided to re-open the criminal inquiry. But the minority report argues that the committee could have interviewed witnesses after the Justice Department closed the investigation in August 2013. Examples of information from CIA interviews cited in report However, there’s ample evidence that the interviews of CIA officials provided the report’s authors with details about the interrogation of specific detainees and techniques. For example, it includes multiple statements about ""Cobalt,"" a detention facility. The agency’s chief of interrogations told the inspector general that Cobalt ""is good for interrogations because it is the closest thing he has seen to a dungeon, facilitating the displacement of detainee expectations."" One senior interrogator told the inspector general that his team found one detainee who, ""'as far as we could determine,' had been chained to the wall in a standing position for 17 days."" The report also includes information about the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11. James Pavitt , the CIA’s deputy director of operations, told the inspector general that he ""did not recall specifically ordering that a detainee be waterboarded right away,"" but he ""did not discount that possibility."" Experts weigh in on the report We checked with intelligence experts to see whether the lack of face-to-face interviews with CIA employees (other than Hayden) casts a shadow on the report, and most said the committee had plenty of testimony to draw from without them. While in-person interviews with CIA officials could have potentially been useful to the committee, said Anthony Clark Arend, a government and foreign service professor at Georgetown University, ""all the necessary information that could have been obtained from those interviews was available to the committee through other means."" University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O’Connell, a specialist on international law, said the large amount of information from CIA officials available from the inspector general and other sources meant that the Senate panel had ""ample basis on which to draw conclusions."" ""Indeed, this testimony could be viewed as more reliable than anything officials might have given directly to an investigating committee, given that such a committee and staff might have been viewed as adversarial,"" she said. Patrick Eddington, a former CIA analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, noted that the CIA was given the opportunity to respond to the draft report. He also noted that the CIA’s current director, John Brennan, submitted his response to the committee and mentioned that an agency review team responded to the report. ""I do not think the reliance on other investigative transcripts—especially those of the CIA IG —in any way diminishes the power of this report summary,"" Eddington said. Our ruling Rubio said that the authors of a report on CIA’s torture techniques ""never interviewed a single CIA official."" He has a point that the committee did not conduct fresh, face-to-face interviews with CIA officers as it was writing the report. However, this glosses over important context. The committee used testimony by then-CIA director Hayden, and the committee had access to transcripts of numerous prior interviews of key CIA officials conducted by the Inspector General and other entities. Rubio’s statement creates the misleading impression that the report wasn’t based at all on interviews with CIA employees, and that’s not the case. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/dec/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-committees-torture-report-failed-/
"['Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Robin Vos']","
Did Robin Vos change his tune on timing of right-to-work debate?
","As they sought re-election in 2014, Gov. Scott Walker and Republican legislative leaders downplayed their interest in blocking private-sector unions from requiring workers to become members when hired at unionized shops. But as 2014 winds down, a sudden push for quick consideration of so-called ""right to work"" legislation is attracting much attention at the Capitol. The turn of events drew scorn from Democratic legislative leaders and labor officials but was cheered by some conservatives. ""Reversal: WI Republicans to push right-to-work legislation after all"": That was the headline over conservative blogger Ed Morrissey’s commentary in a Dec. 4, 2014 posting. This is a good opportunity to put the Flip-O-Meter to use. We’ll focus on Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a longstanding and high-profile backer of right-to-work -- specifically on his stance on when Wisconsin should debate the issue and when it might take effect. In short, on the urgency of the issue. As usual, we offer our disclaimer. The Flip-O-Meter does not rate the rightness or wrongness of a position, of even the merits of changing it. It is simply a measure of whether someone has changed positions or made inconsistent statements. Right to work  A state is considered a ""right-to-work"" state if it prohibits unions from negotiating contracts with employers that provide for a ""union shop."" A union shop is a workplace in which all employees are required to pay union dues. On the flip side, a state that allows union shops is considered by unions to be a ""free-bargaining"" state. The National Right To Work Legal Defense Foundation says the 24 states that have passed Right to Work laws are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming. Unions say right to work laws break people’s bargaining power and lead to reduced wages and benefits. Proponents of such laws, including Vos, have cited higher rates of income growth and employment in right-to-work states. We have summarized the evidence this way in various fact checks: There is some evidence of economic advantage in right to work states. But evidence is lacking that right to work, rather than other factors, is the cause. Let’s look at what Vos has said in recent years, since Republicans won control of the three branches of government, about taking it up. December 2010: After Walker’s election, Vos said he might propose rewriting state law so Wisconsin workers could no longer be required to pay union dues to hold a job. At the time, he was the incoming Finance Committee co-chairman. ""From my perspective, I think that if you look at all of the data that has been collected, states that have non-forced, compulsory union membership when you want to work somewhere have higher rates of income growth, have higher rates of manufacturing -- actually, over time, have seen much greater increases in their standard of living,"" Vos said at the time on WISN’s ""Upfront with Mike Gousha."" A few months after Vos spoke, Walker introduced Act 10, which focused only on public-sector unions. It all but eliminated collective bargaining for most public employees. Act 10 also prohibited the automatic deduction of union dues from government workers’ checks. Amid the controversy over Act 10, Vos did not pursue a similar measure for private-sector unions. May 2012: During the Walker recall race, Vos said he supported right to work but ""I am not going to pursue that any time in the foreseeable future, and I am confident that Gov. Walker is not either."" He spoke after a video surfaced in which Walker told a billionaire backer of his that he planned to ""divide and conquer"" unions starting with public-sector ones. January 2013: A month after Michigan outlawed forced union membership, Vos pledged that no private-sector right-to-work bill would be voted on in the legislative session starting January 2013 and ending January 2015. He kept that promise. April 2013: When conservative talk show host Jerry Bader asked if right to work would be on the agenda if Walker is re-elected in 2014, Vos said it could be four or more years away. ""It's going to take a long while for us to really see the impact of what it will take to turn Wisconsin around."" July 2014: After Act 10 was upheld in the state Supreme Court, Vos said he remained a backer of right to work, but he ""does not think this is the time to try it in Wisconsin."" October 2014: Days before the Nov. 4 elections, Vos said on Wisconsin Public Radio: ""It’s not on our agenda. I know the Democrats have used a lot of scare tactics to say it’s going to be brought up in the next two years. It’s not going to be."" He spoke as the Assembly Republicans released a detailed written agenda for 2015. It did not mention right to work. Nov. 9, 2014: Less than a week after Republicans retained full control in Madison, Vos again appeared on Gousha’s show. He was asked if there was ""any chance"" right to work could happen in the next couple of years. ""I definitely think we should have the discussion of whether it’s good or bad,"" Vos said. Vos made it clear, though, that he wanted to make a detailed case to the public and not rush to action. ""The public support for right to work is not necessarily there today, and I say that once again as a supporter,"" Vos said. He noted the ""big ruckus"" ignited in Madison in 2011 when Walker introduced Act 10. Dec. 1, 2014: After news broke of a newly formed private group to promote right to work legislation in Wisconsin, Vos issued a statement: ""I have long been a supporter of right to work and drafted a proposal in the past. I look forward to a healthy discussion as the case is made for the benefits of being a right to work state."" Dec. 4, 2014: Republican Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate leader, jumped in and gave new urgency to the issue. Fitzgerald said right to work must be debated early in the session that begins in January 2015. Vos didn’t disagree that it should be debated during the session, but said he had no plans to take the issue up right away in January in the Assembly. For this item, we asked Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer whether Vos had been consistent on the timetable of taking up right to work. The Journal Sentinel’s story about Fitzgerald’s comments, she noted, quoted Vos saying: ""Rushing into it certainly doesn't serve any purpose."" ""As a supporter of right to work, he welcomes a healthy discussion on the issue, one that looks like it is just beginning,"" Beyer told us. Our rating There’s no dramatic change by Vos here, even on the timing of considering right to work. Even after the election, Vos seemed reluctant to let another contentious debate over unions take precedence over the rest of his agenda. But he’s no longer talking about years of waiting before legislators take up the issue, in contrast to his campaign-season rhetoric. On balance, we rate this a Half Flip.",/factchecks/2014/dec/10/robin-vos/did-robin-vos-change-his-tune-timing-right-work-de/

Texas Right to Life says UT students signed petition to abort babies, children up to age 5
","An anti-abortion group soliciting contributions to bolster its presence on Texas college campuses drew our attention by associating University of Texas students with legalizing child murder. A Dec. 5, 2014, ""Murder: urgent"" email blast from Jim Graham, executive director of Texas Right to Life, opened: ""I received word that students at the University of Texas in Austin signed a petition seeking the legal right to abort newborn babies up to five-years-old. You read that correctly. You and I call it murder and infanticide. As ridiculous as this petition sounds, I do not take it lightly, and I know you don't either."" For real? Video basis of claim To our request for detail, a group spokeswoman, Melissa Conway, emailed us a link to a video posted on YouTube by InfoWars.com, the reporting project shepherded by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. In the video, a sports-jacketed man in shades seemingly draws UT students to sign just such a petition. An unsigned version appears on screen, stating: ""Please support the Post-Birth Abortion Act of 2014. This is to emphasize that the moral status of the newborn baby is comparable with that of a fetus … rather than that of a child. Therefore, we claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be. This post-birth abortion can take place until a newborn is self aware or reaches 5 years old. This act is supported by numerous scientists and medical doctors as a safe and effective way to preserve the quality of life."" The man shown collecting the signatures, Joe Biggs of InfoWars.com, says on camera he’s ""here at the University of Texas in Austin,"" then says there’s a trend going around U.S. college campuses of talking up post-birth abortions. ""It’s all the new rage,"" he says. The video flashes part of a student-written story posted online Oct. 29, 2014, headlined ""Trending: More college students support post-birth abortion,"" quoting an activist saying support for infanticide or child killings had been noted from students at Purdue, the University of Minnesota and the University of Central Florida. (On Oct. 30, 2014, the debunkists at Snopes.com acted on the same story, finding False the idea that a ""growing number of college students support ‘post-birth abortions,’ extending to children as old as four or five."") In the video, Biggs says a lot of college students around the country ""agree with killing babies up to the age of four or five. So I came out here today to find out whether or not UT agrees with post-birth abortions."" All told, the video shows Biggs talking to 16 students about the petition; 12 sign, it appears, three decline and it’s unclear what one man decides. By our sights, not everyone is paying attention. At least two students act while wearing headphones, two sign while talking on phones and another signs while holding a plate of food in her other hand. ""The more the merrier,"" Biggs says to one student, ""the more we can help empower women."" He tells another the proposal is to ""give women the right to have abortions."" If an abortion is botched, Biggs says, and the baby is born, ""it gives the mother the opportunity to continue on with it,"" meaning the abortion. A woman refusing to sign tells Biggs: ""I’m not doing that. That’s freaking ridiculous."" Petitioner: About 30 students approached To our inquiry, Biggs said by phone he collected the signatures on the campus at midday Oct. 29. Biggs said he showed the petition to about 30 students -- meaning around 17 declined to sign, he agreed. ""Some people walked by me"" and said ""this is crazy, you’re out of your mind,"" Biggs said. Student comments At our request, Biggs emailed us a page listing 13 names and signatures, enabling us to identify the purported signers and try to reach them. We heard back by email from three students who confirmed signing the petition, each one expressing surprise at what she or he had endorsed: --Danielle Bainter said she signed the petition in a rush to class after the presenter misrepresented its purpose. ""Had I fully understood the actual position the organizer was advancing, there is absolutely no way that I ever would have signed his petition. To be clear, I unequivocally do not support"" such an act, she wrote. ""To me, the stated purpose is so horrifying and revolting that I find it difficult to imagine that such a petition or related act could be advanced for anything more than a political stunt."" She said she wouldn’t make the mistake again. --Milla Lubis said she signed the petition after ""the man petitioning led me to believe it was about keeping a women's health clinic open. After reading what was printed on the petition I realized this was not the case but I felt obligated to sign,"" Lubis said, ""because I had already been handed the petition.""

Mike Martinez, PAC says, cut a deal to avoid possible jail time, sticking taxpayers with legal bill
","This message may have landed in your mail: The Austin City Council member in the hunt for mayor may have averted imprisonment with taxpayers’ assistance. ""Politician Mike Martinez cut a deal with prosecutors to avoid facing possible jail time and stuck us with his $24,657.50 legal bill,"" the Progress for Austin PAC’s mailer says. Does that statement about Martinez, who faces lawyer Steve Adler in a Dec. 16, 2014, runoff, hold up? To our inquiry, Marc Winkelman, an Austin businessman listed in the PAC’s campaign treasurer paperwork, said by email the claim was based on news stories in the Austin American-Statesman and Austin Bulldog and government documents. From the cited information and interviews, we confirmed the city paid that much in attorney costs for Martinez after a nearly two-year investigation of council practices. Also clear, Martinez wasn’t alone in reaching an accord effectively ending the inquiry. In 2011-12, the Travis County attorney, David Escamilla, oversaw the investigation touched off by a complaint that council members were routinely meeting privately, in groups of two or three, to discuss city business. Escamilla wanted to know if the council was trying to circumvent the Texas Open Meetings Act, which prohibits elected officials from secretly deliberating about upcoming votes. At issue was whether members were creating ""walking quorums,"" in which they relayed information to each other to work out a vote’s outcome in advance of the body’s public meetings. According to an October 2012 Austin American-Statesman news story, agreements signed by Mayor Lee Leffingwell and six fellow council members who had been in office when the inquiry started spared the members from misdemeanor charges that could have led to jail terms of up to six months and $500 fines. Per the agreements, the signers agreed to take open-government courses and keep following such laws, the story said. At the time, Escamilla said his office had found ""multiple violations"" of state open-meeting laws. Council members ""regularly deliberated outside of the public’s purview by use of almost every modern communication medium that exists. We found probable cause to believe that multiple violations"" occurred, he said, though he also noted the practice had existed before the affected council members were in office. But criminal charges weren’t filed, he said, in part because the council had taken open-government steps, notably ending the private meetings, instead holding public work sessions — long, wide-ranging discussions — two days before each council meeting. In a press release, Escamilla said that if council members didn’t comply with the agreements, ""we will file criminal charges based on the alleged violations that were the subject of the investigation"" with convictions possibly leading to fines of $100 to $500 and/or ""confinement"" of 30 to 180 days. We contacted Martinez’s attorney through the investigation, Joe Turner, who said by phone the statement in the mailer misrepresented events in that ""there never was a prosecution, there was never a criminal case filed,"" Turner said. In contrast, Escamilla told us of Martinez: ""It is true that he entered into an agreement where my office deferred prosecution for two years on the condition that he agree and abide by the terms of the agreement, which had multiple terms designed to prevent him or the city from violating the public information, records retention and open meetings acts."" The agreement signed by Martinez, which we downloaded from the Bulldog, said that since Martinez joined the council in June 2006 until the investigation, Martinez had routinely participated in private meetings with fellow council members in advance of public council meetings. ""The aforementioned meetings or one-on-one's"" between council members ""were calendared on the mayor's and each member's public calendar. A number of these were posted on the Internet. There was no attempt to hide them nor keep them a secret,"" the agreement said. In the agreement, Martinez said he hadn’t violated the open-meetings law and wasn’t admitting guilt to any offense. The agreement ""is a good-faith effort by both parties to resolve the county attorney's office investigation, and in consideration of the county attorney's legitimate effort to enforce the Open Meetings Act and Mike Martinez's efforts to ensure that even the potential for appearance of impropriety is avoided by implementing best practices related to and open government,"" it said. Escamilla elaborated to us that if a member had refused to sign the ""plea bargain"" agreement, he or she would have been charged with violating a provision in the state’s government code barring a member or group of members of a governmental body from knowingly conspiring to circumvent the open meetings law by meeting in numbers less than a quorum for the purpose of secret deliberations. ""The"" PAC’s ""statement is accurate with respect to the fact that Mr. Martinez entered into an agreement deferring prosecution on the condition he abide by the agreement,"" Escamilla said. Taxpayers stuck with legal tab? Next, we looked into city taxpayers getting ""stuck"" with Martinez’s legal costs, as the mailer says. When the investigation closed, the city had generally spent about $383,000 out of contracts worth $444,000 in hiring three law firms to advise city officials and the council on the investigation and open-meetings matters, the Statesman then reported. One of several web links in the mailer’s fine print led us to an April 2013 Austin Bulldog news story stating $157,636 was paid by the city to attorneys who had represented council members in connection with the inquiry. And that story included a link to what appeared to be a Dec. 7, 2012, city document showing $24,657.50 paid to Turner, who reported 69.75 hours of work serving Martinez from March 25, 2011, through Oct. 24, 2012, at a fee of $350 an hour. Turner’s tabulation also showed $245 in charges for a paralegal to copy 440 notebook pages. In our conversation with him, Turner said the city was obligated to represent Martinez and other council members because the inquiry concerned their official actions. To our inquiry, city officials didn’t say if a particular ordinance requires as much. Martinez and Adler By phone, Martinez said any insinuation council members cut a deal to avoid jail time isn’t accurate in that no charges were filed. If charges had been leveled, he said, a judge or jury would have determined guilt or innocence as well as any penalties, he said, not the county attorney. Finally, we wondered whether Adler would have signed one of the agreements if he’d been on the council. His campaign manager, Jim Wick, replied by email: ""We'd prefer not to comment on this issue as it is not one that our campaign has ever raised."" Our ruling The PAC said Martinez ""cut a deal with prosecutors to avoid facing possible jail time and stuck us with his $24,657.50 legal bill."" Martinez, like fellow council members who’d routinely conferred before public meetings despite restrictions in law, signed an agreement arguably heading off the possibility of jail time, though the county still would have had to file charges before winning a conviction and a sentence. Council members including Martinez also went along with the city paying related legal bills. We rate the statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Barack Obama']","
Is America younger than its economic rivals due to immigration?
","We’re not sure what a sexy argument for immigration reform would sound like, but President Barack Obama admitted that one he offered last week was a bit on the wonky side. ""It's not a sexy argument to make to the public, but we are younger than our competitors, and that is entirely because of immigration,"" Obama told a group of business executives. ""And when you look at the problems that China, Japan, Europe, Russia, are all going to have, a lot of it just has to do with their getting old. And we stay young because were constantly being replenished by these striving families from around the world. And we should want that to continue."" We agree that this argument isn’t sexy. But is it accurate? The age of the population is important to a country because taxes generated by incomes of young workers support health care costs and Social Security benefits for those who are no longer working. We’ll take his claim in two parts. U.S. vs its competitors Is the United States younger than its competitors? ""Competitors"" is a loose term, but judging by the countries Obama listed, he’s comparing the United States to other large economies. There are a few ways we can determine whether a country is ""young."" We can compare median ages between countries. Or we can look at the percentage of the population that falls between certain age groups. Finally, we can look at demographic projections for what their age breakdown will be at a point in the future. Let’s take the top 15 countries by gross domestic product (GDP) and use the various models to compare their ages.   Country Median age Percent of population under 24 Percent of population under 54 Percent of population 65 and older in 2050 United States 37.6 33.1 73.0 21.4 China 36.7 31.8 79.0 23.9 Japan 46.1 22.9 61.0 36.5 Germany 46.1 23.6 65.3 32.7 France 40.9 30.6 69.2 25.5 United Kingdom 40.4 29.9 70.9 24.7 (Great Britain only) Brazil 30.7 40.3 84.0 22.5 Russia 38.9 27.1 72.9 20.5 Italy 44.5 23.6 66.6 33.0 India 27.0 46.6 87.2 12.7 Sources: CIA World Factbook and Pew Research Center. In each case, it does appear that the United States is among the youngest countries. It’s certainly much younger than the European Union nations and Japan, and that trend will hold through the mid 21st century. You can also look at the European Union as a separate entity. It consists of many of the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced, industrialized economies. In the European Union, about 26 percent of the population is under the age of 24, and 66 percent are under 54 years old. By both measurements, the United States is younger than the European Union. The biggest exceptions are Brazil and India, two countries that have booming populations and large GDPs, but which began to industrialize later than the United States, Europe and Japan, and neither are considered advanced economies. The most interesting comparisons are China and Russia. Their age structure is relatively close to that in the United States. China, according to the CIA World Factbook, has a slightly younger median age than the United States and a larger percentage of its population is under the age of 54. On the other hand, with fewer very young people, China is expected to have a larger share of its population over 65 by 2050. China’s longstanding one-child policy, though softened recently, has created future demographic challenges for the country as well. Russia is slightly older than the United States when measured by median age, but it will have a smaller portion of its population over 65 in 2050. Bottom line: Brazil and India are clearly younger than the United States, and China and Russia are in the same ballpark, but the United States is younger than key European countries and Japan. The immigration affect The second question is what role immigration plays in keeping America’s population relatively young? The short answer is: Quite a bit, though the exact extent is hard to quantify. Obama’s statement is generally on point, said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Research Center. A 2014 Pew report, ""Attitudes About Aging,"" found that the United States has four times the immigrant population than any other country with Russia a distant second. The percentage of immigrants in the U.S. population was the third-highest of all the countries studied in the Pew report. Researchers estimate that 50 percent of the United States’ population growth from 1960 to 2005 stems from immigrants and their descendants. ""Without immigration, U.S. population growth from 2005 to 2050 would be only 8.5 percent, more on par with that of European nations,"" the report concluded. If that were the case, the United States, like Europe, would be on path where its fertility rates fell short of replacement level — that is, not reproducing fast enough to replace the number of people dying. Immigrants coming to the United States tend to be younger and in their childbearing years. They also tend to reproduce at slightly higher rates than American natives and at much higher rates than the populations of other superpowers, Passel said. The net effect of the United States’ relatively high immigration rate is to raise the fertility rate beyond replacement levels. ""We are not facing the kind of demographic deficits that some of the European and Asian countries are facing as a result of low fertility and little immigration,"" Passel said. ""These countries have to devote a substantial share of resources to supporting the elderly."" That said, relatively high immigration brings its own downside as well, Passel said. ""The long-term projections show that immigrants don’t magically save Social Security,"" he said. ""The issue there is the immigrants eventually get old, too. At least in the short to medium term, having immigrants come into the country adds to the workforce and Social Security collections, but it also adds to the obligations in the long term."" Our ruling Obama said, ""We are younger than our competitors, and this is entirely because of immigration."" The United States is considerably younger than key European countries and Japan, but its age structure is largely similar to China and Russia. Brazil and India, which are best described as emerging but still developing competitors, have substantially younger populations. His main point — that immigration is driving America’s relative youth — is largely accurate. The United States is home to more immigrants than any other country, and many of them are younger and reproduce at higher rates than do native-born Americans. Without its immigration levels, the U.S. would look much more like Europe in its age structure. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/dec/09/barack-obama/america-younger-competitors-because-immigration/
"['Education', 'Military', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says only 35 to 40 percent pass military entrance exam
","Common Core’s Republican defender-in-chief, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has been known to marshal a varied portfolio of evidence to show that the United States need to raise its education standards. In a question-and-answer session at a Wall Street Journal event on Dec. 1, Bush told attendees that a majority of high school graduates aren’t ready for college or work. He added that our educational schools are also a problem for the military. ""In the video beforehand,"" Bush said, Gen. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ""talked about 25 percent pass rate. Now, that's not just because of the test. That's also because of obesity and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. And these are abysmal numbers. (These are) horrific numbers. And yet, there's no one marching in the streets. There's no one saying, you know, ‘The end is near because of this.’ But the fact is, the end is near if we can't fix this."" Bush is correct that obesity and tattoos keep out some applicants. But do only 35 to 40 percent of applicants for the military pass the test? Military entrance exam We’ll note right off the bat that Bush is wrong because he flubbed this talking point. Bush’s spokeswoman Jaryn Emhof told PolitiFact that Bush had meant to say that about one-third fail the test rather than pass it. In fact, she added, just a month earlier, Bush gave an education summit speech in which he said, ""Almost a third of high school graduates fail the military entrance exam."" We applaud Bush’s team for acknowledging his error, but the topic is an interesting one, so we’ll proceed by continuing to address the facts behind the claim. We were unable to find a single, definitive source of data to show what percentage of applicants pass or fail the exam. This is partly because each branch of the military sets its own acceptance rate. Applicants for the military take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB. A subset of the tests are combined to compute a score that is used to determine eligibility. This is called the Armed Forces Qualification Test, or AFQT. It tests applicants’ verbal and math abilities, among other areas. For the military, the largest single disqualifying factor is health, including such problems as obesity. The estimate for those who are disqualified only because of aptitude is about 2 percent, said Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman. That includes not just people who failed the test but also those with other academic deficiencies, such as failure to get a GED. However, this number does not tell the full story, since it doesn’t account for those who are ineligible for more than one reason -- for example, failing the test and being obese. By law, the military can process any applicant who scores in the 10th percentile or higher, although individual services set their cut-offs somewhat higher, typically in the 30 percentile range or higher. We tried to get data from the service branches regarding what percentage failed the test based on the minimum score they accept and were unable to do so. The Army referred us back to the Defense Department. We were unable to get additional details from the Navy. A spokesman for the Marines said that they don’t track data for potential applicants who are disqualified. ""The short answer is that 31 is the minimum score required for an applicant to enlist into the Marine Corps without incurring greater scrutiny,"" Marines spokesman Sgt. Bryce Piper said, referring to scores in the 31st percentile or higher. Applicants who score 21-30 can still enlist if they pass an additional review and don’t require waivers due to any other issues. However, we found a couple studies that looked at the failure rate of test takers. The most specific was was a 2010 study by The Education Trust, an entity focused on improving educational achievement. Researchers looked at nearly 350,000 high school graduates between the ages of 17 and 20 who applied for entry to the Army between 2004 and 2009. That means the sample included recent high school graduates who had already been screened out for other disqualifying factors. The study found that about 23 percent failed to achieve the qualifying score. We asked a spokeswoman for Bush if that study was his source and she told us that it was, as well as a 2009 paper written by Mission Readiness, a group of retired military officials. That paper cited a 30 percent test-taker failure rate for the Army (though it attributed that information to an Army official without providing any further details). A Mission Readiness spokesman said his organization now relies on the Education Trust figure. Meanwhile, a 2009 paper by the Rand Corp. found that the passage rate varied widely when broken down by race and service branch. For example, about 70 percent of whites passed the test for the Air Force, while the figure was closer to 40 percent for Hispanics and blacks. The test isn’t the biggest hurdle, said Beth Asch, senior economist at Rand and one of the paper’s authors. ""The real issue is weight and high school diploma,"" she told PolitiFact. Our ruling Bush said that ""the pass rate for a high school level test to join the military is 35 to 40 percent."" A Bush spokeswoman said he meant to say that one-third failed the test, a rate that is roughly in line with one credible measure of applicants to the Army (though the available data is scattered and incomplete). Still, what Bush said was incorrect, so we rate it False.",/factchecks/2014/dec/09/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-only-35-40-percent-pass-military-ent/

Social media meme says number of unemployed has risen sharply under Barack Obama
","Late last week, the federal government announced what was widely perceived as a strong jobs report, with an increase of 321,000 jobs over the previous month. This capped a year of the most robust employment growth in years. But that hasn’t stopped criticism about weak job gains from circulating on social media. Around the time the new job numbers were being released, a reader asked us to check a meme circulating on social media. The meme features an image of a glum-looking President Barack Obama, along with the caption, ""When he took office, 2.3 million people were out of work. Five-plus years later, we have 5 million-plus out of work. In what world is this recovery?"" It was posted by a Facebook page and Twitter account called Barack Obama's Dead Fly. (The user’s odd name presumably stems from a 2009 incident in which Obama, during a televised interview, slapped dead a fly that had been bothering him.) The meme’s claim was so out of step with recent jobs data that we decided to delve into the official numbers produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. First, we looked at the most basic measure: How many people were officially categorized as unemployed in January 2009, compared to the number today? We found that there were almost 12.1 million Americans classified as unemployed in 2009, and a bit over 9.1 million in November 2014. Not only are both of the specific job figures in the meme way off-base, but the trend line is even less accurate -- the number of unemployed Americans has declined by 3 million, or by one-fourth, since Obama took office. Tweaking the time frame doesn’t help, either. If you look at the weakest point of Obama’s tenure -- October 2009 -- there were a little less than 15.4 million unemployed Americans, making the decline to today even steeper -- 6.3 million people, or a 41 percent decline. Similarly, pushing the end time to earlier in 2014 (when the meme may have been made) doesn’t change the overall picture. Could the meme creator have been using a different, broader measurement to define the term ""out of work""? Just in case, we took another crack with expanded measures. First, we added together three struggling groups -- the number of people who are unemployed, the number of people who are officially employed but are working part-time because of economic headwinds, and the number of ""discouraged"" workers who want to work but have stopped looking and thus aren’t counted as being in the labor force. Did the combination of these three categories support the meme’s message? No. In January 2009, this broader measurement of employment distress included 20.8 million people, a number that fell to 16.7 million people by November 2014 -- a decline of 4.1 million, or about one-fifth. This statistic doesn’t support the meme’s claims, either. Finally, we looked at the number of Americans age 16 and up who were not employed -- for whatever reason -- on both of those dates. In January 2009, there were 92.4 million Americans who were not employed. By November 2014, there were 101.5 million, an increase of 9.1 million. This comparison shows a growth in non-working Americans, as the meme did, but the numbers are vastly higher than the meme says, so this couldn’t be the source of the statistic. In addition, the rise in non-working Americans is shaped at least in part by factors out of Obama’s control, including the retirement of the baby boom generation and longer lifespans. Put simply, it’s not a great indicator of the labor market. We asked Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, whether he could think of any statistic we overlooked. He said we could have considered a particular state, such as California, which is both large and has struggled economically. But when he looked at the numbers, he found that California’s unemployment level was 1.87 million in January 2009 and dropped to 1.31 million by October 2014, the latest month available. So this doesn’t support the meme either. The person who created meme ""appears to be very far removed from the national-level unemployment statistics,"" Burtless said. Our ruling The meme claims that when Obama took office, ""2.3 million people were out of work. Five-plus years later, we have 5 million-plus out of work."" No national figure produces the specific numbers cited in the meme -- and, more importantly, the direction of the changes are flatly opposite to what the meme claims. By almost every metric you can use to calculate the number of Americans who are ""out of work,"" the number has been going down, not up. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/dec/09/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-number-unemployed-has-risen/

Weeding out the different effects of cannabis oil and marijuana
","State lawmakers have a month before they get back to work in the 2015 legislative session and already the debate over medical marijuana has gotten into the, ahem, weeds. State Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon serves as co-chair of a joint legislative committee that has studied whether and how to legalize the drug for certain conditions, including seizures in children. Peake has revived a bill aimed at allowing cannabis oil made from marijuana plants for treatment of certain seizure disorders and other health problems. He is finalizing that proposal, pre-filed as House Bill 1 after a similar measure fell short last session. But another committee member, state Sen. Curt Thompson, D-Tucker, is proposing a competing bill that would allow vaporized, edible or smokable marijuana. Thompson also has filed a resolution, calling for a statewide referendum on whether to authorize recreational use of the drug. Confusion about the oil form versus a smokeable drug has prompted Peake, who said he does not support expanded use, to speak out. ""We believe that the medical cannabis oil –  very low in THC, that doesn’t have a psychoactive component to it, cannot get you high – is a better approach for our citizens,"" Peake said in a press conference before a committee meeting last week. Opponents of the oil have raised safety concerns. So PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look at  Peake’s contention that the oil extracted from marijuana won’t get users high. First, a reminder that the federal government still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I substance, defined as ""the most dangerous"" drug ""with no currently accepted medical use."" Despite that designation, 23 states have legalized medical marijuana, allowing access to the drug for a variety of medical conditions. Another 11 states – including neighboring Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee  – have enacted laws allowing cannabis oil products for medical reasons in limited situations. The key difference in allowing the oil, supporters say, is that it is high in cannabidiol and low in tetrahydrocannabinol. Both are compounds found in the marijuana plant that act on cell receptors that control neurotransmitters in the brain and the immune system from various organs, such as the spleen. Cannabidiol, known as CBD, is an antioxidant and not psychoactive. Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the long-known mind-altering part of pot. Cannabis oil is made from strains of marijuana already bred to be high in CBD and low in THC. For medical use, the oil is made with less than 3 percent THC and is orally ingested. Children’s doses tend to be at 1 percent THC, or lower. Studies are scarce on the medical benefits of such a product, given the Schedule I classification. But research does show that THC is what brings both it and CBD into the brain, where CBD’s antioxidant properties are thought to protect the brain. That evidence helped the federal Department of Health and Human Services earn a patent on medical marijuana in 2003. Anecdotally, parents of children with epilepsy and other seizure diseases back up the findings, reporting marked improvement from the cannabis oil. A London drug company, GW Pharmaceuticals, has created a drug out of highly purified CBD that has shown in preclinical studies that it potentially reduce seizures. The firm is waiting on final approval from Georgia Regents University and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to begin clinical trials in Georgia with children who have severe seizure disorders. None of the existing studies or anecdotes from parents acknowledge or report any ""high"" from cannabis oil. Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while acknowledging the federal government does not see marijuana as medicine, reports that CBD as a ""non-psychoactive cannabinoid"" that may prove useful in treating epilepsy as well as some inflamation disorders and mental illnesses. In other words, while the medical use of cannabis oil can be debated given the limited number of medical and clinic studies, there is some common ground on the product. Marijuana remains officially a more dangerous drug than cocaine, according to the federal government. But the main component of the plant used to make cannabis oil doesn’t have the mind-altering, munchies-inducing effect associated with street use of the plant.

Jesse Ventura says the Nazis pioneered the use of fluoridated water
","Were Nazis the first to put fluoride in the water? In a recent interview with Salon.com, Jesse Ventura -- whose varied career has included stints as a professional wrestler, governor of Minnesota, and talk show host -- brought up a topic that’s often been raised by conspiracy theorists. At one point during the interview, Salon asked whether he worries about ""the U.S. becoming a fascist state."" Here’s what Ventura said: ""I worry about it tremendously. We’re forever incorporating Nazi things into our lives. Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis! I don’t particularly like anything the Nazis did too much, and they were the first ones to put fluoride in the water. They tell us, ‘Oh, it’s for your teeth’ and all that — well, isn’t that your parents’ job, to teach you how to brush your teeth and use mouthwash? Why do you need the government putting some type of chemical in your water? I don’t know if you know this [but] fluoride is the main component of Prozac! What you’ve got is people drinking Prozac-water. Well, what does Prozac do to you? It calms you and dumbs you down so you’re less emotional. There’s a reason for all that stuff; what do we need fluoride in our water for? There’s no reason whatsoever to put chemicals in our water."" Ventura’s answer offers us a lot to analyze, but one of his claims -- that ""fluoride in the water ... was originally done by the Nazis"" -- stood out out to us because PolitiFact Florida debunked this precise claim in 2011. Nazis, who killed millions of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, were known for chemical tests and inhumane medical experiments. Far be it from us to defend them, even in a minor way. But after tracking down the roots of claims about fluoride on the Web, reaching out to Holocaust historians, contacting well-known critics of water fluoridation, and reading book excerpts, magazine articles, and news stories, we concluded that there's no teeth to this claim. With a national celebrity now making the claim, we decided to put it in the spotlight again. Ventura, through a publicist, said he doesn't remember the exact source of the claim but added that he found out about it when he did a show on water conspiracies for his show on the TruTV network. He provided a link to an article on prisonplanet.com, a site run by Alex Jones, a broadcaster who describes himself as a ""prominent figure of the 9/11 Truth Movement."" ""If those facts are false, then the information we received when doing research for the water conspiracy episode was wrong,"" Ventura told PolitiFact in an email. ""Regardless of if the Nazis did it or not, I don't think we should have it in our water. You don't need the government putting chemicals in the water. It's your responsibility to brush your teeth and use mouthwash. I haven't had a house yet with fluoridated water."" (He’s only used well water.) If you’re interested in reading a critique of Ventura’s claim that ""fluoride is the main component of Prozac,"" here’s one by the American Academy of Pediatrics. For this fact-check, though, we’ll stick to the claim about the Nazis. *** We’ll begin by noting that this fact-check won't explore the pros and cons of fluoride in your drinking water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the practice one of the greatest public health achievements of the century; at the same time, groups of citizens, scientists among them, have been wary of the practice since the 1950s. When we originally fact-checked this claim, we contacted historian Patricia Heberer-Rice of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, whose expertise is the German medical community, including Holocaust-era experimentation. Most Nazi medical experiments, she told us, had two themes: new drugs and treatments for common battlefield ailments, from war wounds to typhus, and the more infamous effort to underpin Nazi racial ideas, such as Josef Mengele's twin studies. None of the experimentation that she knows of involved fluoride, either for mind control or for healthy teeth. Meanwhile, in the concentration camp system, as in the ghettos, it would have been surprising if fluoride delivery was a focus — in the final few days before liberation, water lines scarcely delivered water. So, would water have been treated just for the Jews? ""I can't see it,"" she said. But she had heard a similar Cold War-era theory. It wasn't about the Nazis fluoridating water. It was the Communists. We re-connected with Heberer-Rice for this fact-check, and she told us that no additional evidence supporting Ventura’s claim had emerged in the three years since our last fact-check. ""The first mass fluoridation of drinking water was carried out by the U.S. Public Health Service on a trial basis in certain regions of this country in 1945, with its rapid extension in 1950,"" she said. ""The first interest of German scientists in this approach was in 1949"" -- that is, years after the Nazis had been deposed. *** Still, do an Internet search for ""fluoride"" and ""Nazis,"" and you'll find articles such as ""Nazi Connections to Fluoride in America's Drinking Water."" The text appears on various sites, and includes the citations ""Stephen 1995,"" and ""Bryson 2004."" ""Stephen 1995"" is presumably Ian E. Stephens, author of a 1987 self-published booklet, an extract of which was published in Nexus Magazine in 1995 under the title ""Fluoridation: Mind Control for the Masses?"" We tracked down a copy of the article from the magazine's website, an alternative Australian publication covering, among other things, ""suppressed news, free energy, religious revisionism, conspiracy, the environment, history and ancient mysteries, the mind, UFOs, paranormal and the unexplained."" ""Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him,"" says a document quoted in the excerpt. ""Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile."" ""Bryson 2004"" is Christopher Bryson, an investigative reporter and television producer who reported on Guatemalan human rights abuses for the BBC World Service, National Public Radio and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in the 1980s, and later wrote a book called The Fluoride Deception. It delves into murky connections between military-industrial fluoride polluters and the early push for public water fluoridation. But even Bryson -- a backer of certain conspiracies involving fluoridation -- isn’t convinced by the Nazi connection. His book mentions Nazis or Nazism fewer than 10 times, and none of the references discuss water fluoridation. ""I never came across any documentation or credible information showing that fluoride was used in Nazi death camps,"" he told us in 2011. *** In 2009, two scientists published a book called The Fluoride Wars: How a Modest Public Health Measure Became America's Longest Running Political Melodrama. The book presents a lively social history of the fluoridation debate in the United States, starting with the fluoridation of the water in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1945. The hydrologists dedicate more than 30 pages to conspiracy theories and their origins. We contacted one of the co-authors in 2011. ""The World War II death camp statement is an absurd lie,"" said Jay Lehr, who has authored or co-authored more than 30 books, most of them self-described ""boring science books for scientists."" Meanwhile, Paul Connett -- a chemist who directs the anti-fluoridation group Fluoride Action Network and recently co-authored a book called The Case Against Fluoride -- told us in 2011 that the Nazi angle is something that he’s been steering people in his movement away from. ""We have done our level best to discourage opponents of fluoridation from using this emotive argument,"" Connett said. ""The historical evidence for this assertion is extremely weak. It is sad that the U.S. media has done such a bad job of educating the public on this issue that it is so easy for crazy ideas to fill the vacuum."" Our ruling Ventura said, ""Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis!"" Two book authors who researched the topic, one a journalist, the other a hydrologist, found no credible evidence of such a connection. A leading anti-fluoridation activist repudiates the story. The most commonly cited Web source for the story was a 16-year-old extract in a fringe Australian publication. And a Holocaust historian we contacted knew of no such project. This claim remains Pants on Fire! Editor's note: This report initially referred to Ventura as a Navy SEAL, something he includes on his ora.tv biography. Readers later pointed out that there’s been a long-running debate on whether Ventura is justified in calling himself a SEAL.

Watch out, 70% of us have done something that could put us in jail
","Conventional wisdom would tell us that most normal folks will never have an interaction with police like the one Eric Garner had that ultimately led to his death. Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter warned that might not necessarily be the case. Citing the work of Rutgers University law scholar Douglas Husak, Carter wrote on Dec. 4 that ""70 percent of American adults have committed a crime that could lead to imprisonment."" Carter noted that’s in part because there are 300,000 or more federal regulations that may be enforceable through criminal punishment. It's as though, Carter said, lawmakers tack on imprisonment to give a law heft. To paraphrase the old line, we are not just a nation of laws, we are a nation overrun by laws. Carter suggests reigning things in. The fact that 70 percent of people have committed a jailable offense is part of Carter's evidence. We wanted to know if other legal experts thought it was correct. They do. Before we get to their reasons, let’s be clear about what Carter and Husak are saying. By the way, Husak told us that Carter quoted him accurately. For Husak, the question wasn’t whether any court would be likely to put someone behind bars for a particular offense, but whether the law gives them the power to do so. Husak said one need look no further than the laws on prescription drugs. If a doctor gave you a prescription for the common painkiller vicodin and your spouse brings it to you as you lie in bed, ""your spouse is dispensing a controlled substance without a license,"" Husak said. Would that ever be enforced? Not likely. But Husak said that is how the law is written. If that were not enough to get to 70 percent of adults, Husak factored in illicit drug use. According to a 2012 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, over half of the people in every age group born after 1950 said they had used an illicit drug at some time in their lives, primarily marijuana or prescription drugs. That alone comes to about 84 million people, or 37 percent of all people over 20. While some legal experts we reached said they didn’t know how you could come up with an exact number, just about all said it would be no trouble to keep adding more. Sonja Starr at the University of Michigan Law School said many people drink and drive. ""The Centers for Disease Control found 112 million self-reported incidences of drunk driving,"" Starr said, with the caveat that some drivers would report multiple offences. ""And that’s just in a single year."" Starr said you could easily get to the 70 percent mark. By and large, Starr’s counterparts at other law schools agreed. Bennett Capers, professor of law, Brooklyn Law School ""This doesn't give me pause at all. There are thousands of criminal statutes on the books, criminalizing things that some of us do without thinking. This runs the gamut from the serious (in New Jersey, it is technically a crime to have sex without first receiving ""freely given affirmative permission to the specific act of sexual penetration"") to the routine (fudging tax returns) to the mundane (illegal downloads)."" David Gray, professor of law, University of Maryland School of Law ""70 percent seems low to me. Once you factor in illegal drug use, crimes of recklessness (which seldom are detected because no harm accrues), downloading, DUI, failures to report income, and the scores of relatively innocuous offenses that just happen to carry the possibility of jail time in some jurisdictions, I’d be surprised if the percentage wasn’t much higher than 70 percent over the course of most adults’ lifetimes."" Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law and public health, Columbia Law School Fagan said he didn’t know the right percentage, but he could believe the 70 percent figure. ""I’ve violated imprisonable offenses while fishing,"" Fagan said. Robert Weisberg, professor of law, Stanford Law School ""The number is unknowable, but it strikes me as plausible."" Laurie Levenson, professor of law at Loyola Law School Los Angeles ""It does seem to exaggerate the likely number of Americans who are at actual risk of prosecution and imprisonment,"" Levenson said. ""What we really need to pay attention to is the percent of Americans who commit crimes that are on the prosecutors' radar screens."" Levenson’s point gets at a key ambiguity in Carter’s statement. Much depends on the interpretation of ""could lead to imprisonment."" In his article, Carter made it clear he did not mean that imprisonment was in any way likely. His point was simply that too many laws carry too hefty a penalty and in theory, anyone could become ensnared. Our ruling Carter said that more than 70 percent of American adults have committed a crime that could lead to imprisonment. Based on a strictly technical reading of existing laws, the consensus among the legal experts we reached is that the number is reasonable. Way more than a majority of Americans have done something in their lives that runs afoul of some law that includes jail or prison time as a potential punishment. That said, experts acknowledged that the likelihood of arrest, prosecution or imprisonment is exceedingly low for many of Americans’ ""crimes.""  As such, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/dec/08/stephen-carter/watch-out-70-us-have-done-something-could-put-us-j/

Saslaw says 20 percent of female students at University of Virginia are sexually assaulted
","Senate Minority Leader Richard Saslaw seethed after reading a Rolling Stone article detailing an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity. ""I can’t remember when I’ve been angrier as an adult, reading that,"" Saslaw, said during a Nov. 24 meeting with the Falls Church City Council to discuss priorities for the General Assembly session the will begin in January. Saslaw, D-Fairfax, said he will introduce a bill that would require that college officials who are told of a sexual assault to notify law enforcement within 24 hours. ""What parent in their right mind would send a daughter to U.Va. when she’s got – are you ready for this? – a 20 percent chance, a 20 percent chance of being sexually assaulted?"" Saslaw said in the clip posted by Blue Virginia, a liberal blog. Saslaw spoke more than a week before Rolling Stone backed off the story. The magazine’s editor said last week there were discrepancies in the accuser’s version of events and that the magazine’s trust in her ""had been misplaced."" Nonetheless, Saslaw’s statement that 20 percent of female students at U.Va are sexually assaulted at UVa warrants examination. The senator, whose daughter graduated from U.Va., told us the figure came from the Rolling Stone article, which says ""one in five women is sexually assaulted in college though only about 12 percent report it to police."" But the article didn’t say those are the figures are for U.Va. specifically, and for good reason. Let’s take a deeper look: Where does the statistic come from? The Rolling Stone article didn’t cite a source for the one-in-five statistic. But it likely originates from a widely cited study on college sexual assaults conducted in December 2007 by the U.S. Justice Department’s National Institute of Justice. Researchers surveyed 5,446 undergraduate women at two unnamed large public universities -- one in the Midwest and one in the South. The research gained a new wave of attention this year amid a White House push to raise awareness about rape and sexual assault. During an April 29 speech, Vice President Joe Biden said one in five college women are sexually assaulted during their college years. Biden’s office told our colleagues at PolitiFact National that the statement was based on the Justice Department’s findings. The study defined sexual assault as unwanted touching, intercourse, oral sex, anal sex or sexual penetration with an object or finger. Researchers wrote in a Journal of American College Health article in 2009 that 19.8 percent of women surveyed during their senior year had experienced a sexual assault since entering college. But there are some major caveats about the figure. Researchers noted the results were limited to the two unidentified colleges surveyed and may not generalize to the experiences of all college women. They also said the survey had a ""modest"" 42 percent response rate to their Web-based survey, which the researchers noted is lower than other methods, such as face-to-face interviews. They hoped, however, that anonymity would provide more candid answers and better data. James Fox, a professor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University, told PolitiFact National in May that  the ""one-in-five statistic shouldn’t just be taken with a grain of salt, but the entire shaker."" Fox said the issue of sexual assaults on campuses shouldn’t be diminished but faulted the White House for citing national estimates that are ""shaky at best."" Despite the issues with its methodology, the Department of Justice reached similar conclusions to several other studies on sexual assaults on campuses. In a survey this spring at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 17 percent of the school’s undergraduate women said they experienced a sexual assault -- broadly defined by researchers as ""unwanted sexual behaviors involving threats or incapacitation, unwanted sexual touching or kissing, oral sex, sexual penetration or attempted sexual penetration or attempted oral sex."" But the researchers found the undergraduates answered the question differently when asked if they had been ""sexually assaulted or raped"" and were allowed to apply their own definitions to the terms. Under those conditions, 11 percent of the women answered ""yes."" Since it was a voluntary, non-random survey, the school cautioned it would be wrong to ""use these numbers to generalize about the prevalence of unwanted sexual behavior in the lives of all MIT students."" In early 1997, the Department of Justice randomly surveyed 4,446 college women and found that 15.5 percent said they had been ""sexually victimized"" during that school year -- a term that included threats and actions ranging from unwanted touching to rape. The study said that during  the course of an undergraduate career, which often extends five years, ""the percentage of completed or attempted rape among women in higher educational institutions might climb to between one-fifth and one-quarter."" Research that tries to quantify sexual assaults is complicated by a couple of factors. First of all, it is often an unreported crime. The results of the incidence of sexual assault can differ depending on how the crime is defined. The National Institute of Justice notes on its website that ""researchers have been unable to determine the precise incidence of sexual assault on American campuses because the incidence found depends on how the questions are worded and the context of the survey."" Despite such limitations, the institute adds that ""several studies indicate that a substantial proportion of female students -- between 18 and 20 percent -- experience rape or some other form of sexual assault during their college years."" Does the national figure apply to U.Va.? Although the 20 percent is a national number, Saslaw said it applies to U.Va. The senator noted that Rolling Stone reported that U.Va is among 12 universities that has been singled out for an proactive federal compliance review of its procedures handling students’ complaints of sexual assaults. That would ""kind of lead you to believe it’s definitely one-in-five there (at U.Va.),"" Saslaw told us. ""They’re not reviewing all of the colleges across America."" But there’s no way to know whether the one-in-five figure actually does apply to U.Va. We asked the university whether it has figures for the percentage of women students who have been raped, but did not receive a direct response. ""The national statistics on sexual assaults and sexual misconduct on college campuses are alarming and disturbing for everyone, "" U.Va. spokesman Anthony P. de Bruyn told us in an email. ""UVA is taking aggressive action to address these important issues."" U.Va. President Teresa Sullivan, during a Dec. 1 speech, said the university will conduct a survey this spring to determine ""how commonly"" its students experience sexual assaults. We reached out to David Lisak, a forensic consultant and researcher on sex crimes, about the level of sexual assault at U.Va. and whether the 20 percent national figure that Saslaw cites applies to the college. ""Whether these rates of sexual assault apply specifically to UVa is of course an empirical question,"" Lisak told us in an email. ""However, there are by now numerous studies of sexual assault on college campuses, and they are quite consistent in their findings. So one would have to provide some real evidence to argue that the situation at UVa is markedly different than what has been found in national studies."" Our ruling Saslaw says a female student attending U.Va. has a 20 percent chance of being sexually assaulted. Saslaw bases his claim on a Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang rape at UVa that said nationally, ""one in five women is sexually assaulted in college."" Rolling Stone didn’t cite a source, but the statistic is commonly used and is often based on a 2007 federal survey of women at two unnamed colleges. A few other studies have come up with comparable results. The key fact here is that none of the studies, as far as we know, examined U.Va. The university says it plans to start surveying its students next year to quantify incidences of sexual misconduct. Saslaw applies the 20 percent figure to U.Va. without any hard information and his comment suggests that the statistic is unique to the university. We’re not downplaying the issue of sexual assaults at U.Va., a problem that’s been repeatedly acknowledged by Teresa Sullivan, president of the university. But there’s a burden on Saslaw to prove his claim and he comes up short.

Ethics claim leaves out key detail
","
A coalition of government watchdog groups last week demanded changes to toughen Georgia’s ethics guidelines, blasting state lawmakers with fightin’ words like there’s a culture of ""low-level corruption"" in Georgia government.

State Rep. Joe Wilkinson, chairman of the House Ethics Committee, objected to the criticism. He urged patience, noting stronger ethics guidelines just took effect this year. He also pointed out that a national organization ranked Georgia as having one of the toughest ethics laws in the nation, according to a Jan. 20 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

We asked the representative about it. Wilkinson said the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity came up with the ranking on where Georgia stands on ethics.

""If I didn’t believe it was true, I wouldn’t have said it,"" said Wilkinson, a Republican from Fulton County.

One PolitiFact Georgia reader was dubious about Wilkinson’s claim.

""He told me the same thing personally when I was at the Capitol last year,"" said Tom Tortorici of Atlanta, who supported tougher ethics legislation. ""I didn’t believe him then, and I don’t believe him now. Other states have bans and caps on lobbyists gifts. We don’t.""

We called the Center for Public Integrity, which puts out investigative reports on public issues. Its media relations manager, Steve Carpinelli, pointed us to a report it released in June 2009 that ranked each state on the transparency of its financial disclosure reports. The center came up with 43 questions it measured the states on. The questions included how often do state elected officials file disclosure reports, and what information are they required to report about their employers, their investments and property. The center also looked at what states have the authority to audit the disclosure reports.

Georgia ranked seventh in the 2009 report. Wilkinson compares the rankings to the Bowl Championship Series, the system that decides -- often with controversy -- which college football teams are the best in the nation.

But the report looked at only one aspect of ethics regulations, not everything, said William Perry, executive director of Common Cause Georgia. Perry’s group was one of the organizations that joined the call for tougher ethics guidelines.

For example, Perry said measuring ethics rules should also include the power of state agencies to regulate on potential conflicts of interest, gifts from lobbyists and contributions from political action committees.

Ethics regulations has been a big topic of concern under the Gold Dome in recent years. Glenn Richardson resigned as House speaker in 2009 after his ex-wife accused him of an extramarital affair with a female lobbyist. A few years back, federal prosecutors charged state Sen. Charles Walker with, among other things, using campaign contributions to pay off gambling debts. The former senator is now serving 10 years in prison.

The Georgia Legislature last year passed guidelines that prohibit sexual harassment, require many local elected officials to file campaign disclosure reports with the state and make it a crime to use a state agency to attack or harass someone.

Rick Thompson, former executive secretary of the State Ethics Commission, argued the Georgia Legislature has passed some bills that are ""very stringent"" on lobbyists and improved ethics guidelines.

""We’re pretty up there with the requirements of disclosures,"" Thompson said.

True, perhaps. The center’s 2009 report supports that viewpoint. But financial disclosures are only one area of ethics guidelines. Carpinelli said the center plans to conduct a state-by-state review of ethics laws, starting this spring. The research will take about a year, Carpinelli estimates.

We followed up with Wilkinson about what the center told us. He said financial disclosure is a ""major part"" of a state’s ethics package.

""That’s the heart and soul of ethics,"" Wilkinson said.

Wilkinson would get high marks on the Truth-O-Meter if he had said Georgia has some of the toughest rules on financial disclosures in the nation. That’s correct, but it’s not what he said.

Wilkinson’s comments about the Center for Public Integrity’s report may give some people the wrong impression about what the organization was studying. They reviewed financial disclosures, not the entire scope of ethics guidelines. We rate his statement as False.",/factchecks/2011/jan/25/joe-wilkinson/ethics-claim-leaves-out-key-detail/
"['National', 'History', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Matthew Dowd']","
Matthew Dowd says there's no evidence of a State of the Union 'bounce'
","CORRECTION: The initial version of this item erroneously attributed the comment to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. With President Barack Obama about to give the State of the Union address, pundits of all stripes have been pre-analyzing and prognosticating what he may say before a joint session of Congress on Jan. 25, 2011.

On the Jan. 23, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, former Republican strategist Matthew Dowd offered some historical context to how State of the Union speeches actually change public opinion -- or rather, how they do not.

""To me, the State of the Union (addresses) … they don't affect the American public,"" Dowd said during the program’s roundtable segment. ""If you look at … approval numbers going into State of the Unions over the last 35 years and coming out, they do not move the numbers. Even Ronald Reagan, who was lauded as one of the best communicators in the history of this country, never moved the American public.""

We thought we’d see whether Dowd was correct.

While a number of media-affiliated polling organizations track presidential approval ratings, we turned to Gallup because polling experts frequently used the company’s polls for long-term studies. Gallup, which began polling before World War II, has the longest and most consistent track record of publishing such polls.

Mark Blumenthal, a polling analyst who founded the website Pollster.com, published a thorough analysis of the topic in 2006. It was augmented in a 2010 study by Gallup’s own Jeffrey M. Jones.

The Gallup data goes back to 1978 -- to President Jimmy Carter’s first State of the Union address -- and includes a total of 28 addresses. (Most presidents have given an address to a joint session of Congress shortly after their first inauguration, but technically these are not State of the Union addresses. Because of that, neither Blumenthal nor Jones included them in their surveys, and we won’t either.)

Here’s the bottom line as Jones puts it: ""A review of Gallup historical data suggests these speeches rarely affect a president's public standing in a meaningful way, despite the amount of attention they receive.""

By our count, presidents are actually somewhat more likely to see their polling numbers decline than see them rise after they give a State of the Union address. In all, the numbers rose 10 times, fell 15 times and remained unchanged three times. (You can see the year-by-year figures here.) Even more strikingly, the shifts were usually quite small. If you were to define a presidential ""bounce"" as a 5-point rise or more -- a bit outside the typical margin of error of 3 points -- then there have only been three ""bounces,"" or about once in every 10 speeches.

In fact, during the period studied, a president’s standing rose by more than 6 percentage points only once -- the 10-point rise for Bill Clinton in 1998. And that speech was somewhat exceptional, since the Monica Lewinsky scandal had just broken and Clinton used the address to refocus Americans (with some success) on his policy agenda.

Clinton was the only one of the five presidents prior to Obama whose numbers rose when the poll numbers after each president's addresses were averaged together. Clinton saw his approval ratings rise by 3 points on average, while Carter and President Ronald Reagan saw their ratings drop by 1 point, President George H.W. Bush saw his ratings drop by 4 points and President George W. Bush saw his drop by 1 point.

We should note that there is another type of poll taken during State of the Union season, usually with strikingly different results -- so-called ""instant polls."" When Gallup does these polls, they ask people who responded to a pre-State of the Union poll if they minded getting a quick call after the speech to gauge their immediate reaction. Typically, these polls show favorable results toward whoever the president is.

However, Blumenthal discounts the value of these polls, citing data showing that, in most cases, viewership for the State of the Union tilts heavily toward the president’s party. ""Simply put, people who don't like a particular president are considerably less apt to tune him in,"" he quotes ABC polling director Gary Langer as saying.

Since Blumenthal’s published analysis is now five years old, we checked with him to see whether he still felt the same way. ""I definitely think the argument still holds,"" he told us.

Dowd was very close to correct that State of the Union addresses ""do not move the numbers."" Over the past 33 years at least, that has been the case more often than not. And the one president Dowd specifically cited, Reagan, never got a bump greater than 3 points. But there are a few exceptions, including Clinton's 10-point bounce in 1998. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/24/matthew-dowd/maureen-dowd-says-theres-no-evidence-state-union-b/

NRA claims more die by accident from 'medical misadventures' than firearms
","
Are you more likely to die as a result of an accident involving medical care or an accident involving a gun?

The National Rifle Association claims that in Florida and nationally, you are far more likely to die at the hands of a medical professional or procedure -- by accident -- than you are as a result of an accidental firearm incident.

We found a reference to that claim in a Jan. 16, 2011, Miami Herald article about Florida lawmakers filing bills related to firearms. The bills are attracting much interest after the Jan. 8 shooting in Arizona that killed six and injured Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. One of the bills, Senate Bill 432 sponsored by state Sen. Greg Evers, R-Crestview, aims to prevent doctors from asking patients questions about their access to firearms and makes violations a felony punishable by up to a $5 million fine.

Doctors argue against the proposed law. It also would prohibit physicians from refusing to see patients who won't answer questions about guns and bans the medical staff from writing down information about patients and their guns. This bill, then, is a battle between the gun lobby and the doctors' lobby, two powerful groups in Tallahassee.

This Truth-O-Meter isn't going to weigh in on the argument about gun control. Our question: Are the fatality comparisons between medical mishaps and firearms correct?

NRA's accident facts

The Miami Herald article said NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer cited ""statistics showing that medical mishaps kill more people than guns,"" but did not cite the actual statistics. Hammer said she gave the Herald a one-page document called ""Firearms Accidents Facts"" compiled by the Unified Sportsmen of Florida in June 2010. The document compares accidental death by firearms to other types of accidents -- from choking to tricycles -- both nationally and in Florida. The Unified Sportsmen of Florida is the state's affiliate of the NRA.

The fact-sheet includes comparisons to accidental deaths by ""medical misadventures"" -- both in raw numbers and in rates per capita -- but doesn't specify the year. Medical misadventures, the handout says, ""is a term used by some statisticians to cover 'accidents' by doctors and other medical personnel."" Note that this claim covers only gun accidents -- it doesn't include firearm deaths due to murder or suicide.

According to the sheet:

• Nationally, ""4 times more die from 'medical misadventures' "" than firearms.
• In Florida, ""6 times more die from 'medical misadventures' "" than firearms.

Hammer on Jan. 17 directed us to Mark Overstreet, NRA Institute for Legislative Action research coordinator. He told us that the figures -- compiled by the NRA for Hammer -- were from 2007. He pointed us to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WISQARS (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System) -- an interactive database that provides customized reports.

The death data is compiled by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. This information comes from death certificates filed in state vital-statistics offices and includes causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners and coroners, according to the CDC. All of the states comply with providing this data.

Firearm accident data 
On the WISQARS website, we searched Fatal Injury Reports 1999-2007 for ""unintentional,"" ""firearms,"" ""2007"" and ""United States."" That produced a chart that showed 613 deaths in the U.S. for 2007.

Then we queried the same data for Florida and found 16 deaths.

CDC's adverse effects data

The death data about medical care was far more complex. We'll walk you through the numbers and explain why it doesn't provide a complete picture. We'll also discuss the ""medical misadventures"" label.

On WISQARS, we marked ""all intents"" and ""medical care, adverse effects"" for 2007 and saw 2,248 deaths nationwide. For Florida, the number was 108 deaths.

We thought those figures sounded awfully low for deaths as a result of medical errors. A 1999 study by the Institute of Medicine, ""To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,"" concluded that medical error deaths range from about 44,000 to 98,000 a year.

Let's summarize what we found before we delve into why the government's data is so low on such deaths:

Accidental deaths 2007         Nationwide     Florida
Firearms                                          613                16
Medical care adverse effects        2,248               108

What the stats mean 
We interviewed Robert N. Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, to explain what the numbers mean.

The deaths are coded by categories, and one category is indeed labeled ""misadventures to patients during surgical and medical care."" Some examples are an unintentional cut, a foreign object accidentally left in the body during surgery, and contaminated medical substances.

Other categories included in ""adverse effects:""

• Breakdown or malfunctioning of a medical device.

• ""Surgical and other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure."" Anderson told us that refers to procedures such as a patient reacting badly to an organ transplant.

• Complication of medical care, which was a significant factor even though the care (such as surgery) occurred more than one year prior to death. This is also often referred to as ""late effects,"" Anderson said.

So overall, ""medical care, adverse effects"" includes both errors and complications.

How many errors? 
We asked Anderson: Are the majority medical errors?

""I’m not sure,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Only a very few in adverse effects category are explicitly medical misadventures."" He added, ""Just because a misadventure is not specified, doesn’t mean that it didn’t occur. My guess is that many ... (in some categories) are indeed medical errors, but have been characterized as complications.""

Anderson also explained a key limitation of the data: It is only as accurate as the information provided on the death certificates by doctors. The WISQARS system tabulates types of deaths based on the ""underlying cause of death."" Suppose a man had heart disease and needed a heart procedure, a doctor punctured his artery during surgery and the patient bled to death. If the doctor reports the underlying cause of death as heart disease, then it won't be counted in the ""medical care, adverse effects"" category.

The CDC offers another source of online data called the WONDER system, which tabulates if a cause of death was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, even if it wasn't listed as the ""underlying cause."" The most recent year we could look up for WONDER was 2006.

The WONDER database showed 22,116 deaths from ""medical care, adverse effects"" nationwide in 2006 and about 1,319 for Florida. Anderson acknowledges that even that figure is low.

The reason, according to Anderson: ""The physician who makes the error doesn't have any incentive to report it. Actually they have a disincentive to report it even though it's in the interests of medical care in general to have that information reported. ... We are at the mercy of the cause of death certifier and how thorough they are in their reporting of cause of death.""

Anderson said he personally finds some studies more believable than others -- for example he disagrees with counting all hospital infections as errors. But he says he agrees with the Institute of Medicine study that put the figure between 44,000 and 98,000 -- and says even though that study is from 1999, he believes little has changed since then.

Firearm data is  also uncertain

Anderson also raised a concern with the firearm data, that self-inflicted gun deaths could be accidental or a suicide, and some could be mis-classified or labeled as ""intent undetermined.""

It's worth repeating that the vast majority of firearm deaths are by suicide and murder -- only a small slice of firearm deaths are accidental. According to the WISQARS data, in 2007 there were 31,224 firearm deaths nationwide -- the largest category was suicide followed by murder. That total number of firearm deaths is many multiples higher than the CDC's count for ""medical care, adverse effects"" deaths.

We asked Hammer, why make the comparison solely on accidents?

""When doctors claim that they have a right to question children and the parents of children because they want to prevent deaths by accidents with firearms, the facts speak for themselves,"" Hammer said. ""There are a number of areas dealing with medical care over which they have some control that (doctors) should focus attention on.""

And Overstreet, the NRA researcher, defends the use of WISQARS data, even knowing its limitations.

""We are not looking to jack the numbers up,"" he said. ""We are saying this is what the federal government is reporting.""

Anderson doesn't disagree.

""With the data issues surrounding medical errors, it's a fairly difficult comparison,"" he said. However, ""I don't think they are off base. I don't think they are doing something making an invalid comparison. ... What they are basically doing is looking at the government's underlying cause data. They are not even saying it's a gross underestimate. They are being very conservative here.""

Our ruling 
So, is the NRA right to state that, nationwide, people are four times more likely to die from medical misadventures than firearm accidents and that figure drops to six times more likely for Florida? 
The government's 2007 data shows 613 accidental firearm deaths nationwide compared to 2,248 deaths from medical care adverse effect. That's close to four times, as the NRA handout says. In Florida, there were 16 accidental firearm deaths compared to 108 medical care adverse effect. That's almost seven times, even worse than the six times cited by the NRA.

We have two concerns: The WISQARS data comes with a lot of caveats when examining medical errors, and even the gun data may not be perfect. And the NRA's fact-sheet ignores gun deaths from murders and suicides, which take a significantly higher toll than accidents and can't be ignored in the gun debate. 
For the point the NRA is making -- accidents only, guns v. medical misadventures -- the numbers back up their claims but need clarification and context. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/24/national-rifle-association/nra-claims-more-die-accident-medical-misadventures/

The New York Times' Paul Krugman says Texas leads the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance
","
In a Jan. 6 New York Times op-ed column, liberal economist Paul Krugman warns that Texas is the future, and it isn’t pretty: ""What we’re seeing right now is a future that doesn’t work."" 
Among his charges is that Texas is ""leading the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance,"" the column says.  
Texas has so long been cited as the state with the highest percentage of uninsured residents that factual corroboration seldom follows. 
When we asked Krugman for backup, he pointed us to 2007-2009 data from the U.S. Census Bureau comparing the percentage of uninsured residents between states. According to to the bureau’s estimates, Texas ranked first at that time, with 25.5 percent uninsured. New Mexico followed, with 22.6 percent, and then Florida, 20.9. Nationally, 15.8 percent were uninsured, according to the data, with Massachusetts having the fewest uninsured, 5.1 percent.  
An October 2008 policy paper by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation notes that ""Texas has the unfortunate distinction of leading the nation in the number of uninsured citizens,"" but takes issue with the Census Bureau’s methodology, which ""includes anyone uninsured at the time the survey is taken.""  
Separately, we found a national poll indicating Texas ranked No. 1 in uninsured residents the first half of 2010. 
According to the Gallup poll, an average of 26.8 percent of Texas residents were uninsured. Mississippi trailed in second (25.8 percent), followed by Louisiana (24 percent). California landed fifth, with 21.9 percent. And Massachusetts, which requires residents older than 18 to have health coverage, ranked again as the state with the smallest percentage of uninsured residents: 4.9 percent. Gallup said it interviewed 176,193 adults from Jan. 2-June 30, 2010.  
By available indicators, Texas has the nation’s highest percentage of uninsured residents. We rate Krugman’s statement as True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/24/paul-krugman/new-york-times-paul-krugman-says-texas-leads-natio/

Acting Milwaukee County Executive Lee Holloway says he saved the county over $100M on health care
","A special election for Milwaukee County executive will be held in April 2011, which means that before long, boasts from politicians will be as common as tattoos on basketball players.

The five candidates include Lee Holloway, the County Board chairman who became acting county executive in December after Scott Walker resigned to become governor.

Holloway, in a Jan. 12, 2011 meeting with Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, tried for a three-point basket with a boast about the county’s health care expenditures.

""We’ve saved over $100 million of costs,"" he declared, then added for emphasis: ""I did that.""

Has the county really saved more than $100 million on its health care bills? And does Holloway deserve all the credit?

In making his claim, Holloway traced the health care savings to 2006, when the County Board moved to undo changes made by the Walker administration.

Let’s take a look at the sequence of events.

January 2006: Contract implemented.

A four-year contract negotiated by the Walker administration with Madison-based WPS Health Insurance, the county’s third-party administrator for health care, takes effect. It moved the county from being self-insured to fully insured.

Early 2006: Problems surface.

County staff inform the County Board’s Finance and Audit Committee, which requested monthly reports on health care costs, that the county’s 2006 health care costs were projected to exceed the budget by $7.3 million.

Based on a recommendation by the committee, a work group of county employees is formed. Its job is to reduce health care expenses by pursuing changes in, or even termination of, the 4-month-old WPS contract.

October 2006: Staff, contract changes.

The County Board approves a Holloway proposal to create a Division of Employee Benefits to manage health care and pension benefits. The aim is to build expertise in those areas in order to lower costs.

The county also reverts back to the self-insured model for health care through negotiations with WPS. The change is retroactive to January 2006.

November-December 2006: More changes.

The County Board approves a resolution by Holloway and other supervisors to create an advisory committee to help find health care cost savings.

Stuart Piltch -- a consultant hired by the county to help with a pension lawsuit -- is enlisted to help find savings. That recommendation came from county staff attorneys.

Beginning in 2006, the County Board led labor negotiations that resulted in increased co-pays, deductibles and co-insurance for employees.

January 2009: Contract canceled.

The county persuades WPS to release it from the four-year contract one year early. The county then signs a new agreement with UnitedHealthcare, which saved $30 million in one year alone, according to Dave Arena, the first director of the new county employee benefits unit.

(Holloway credited Arena with helping achieve health care cost savings, but fired him without explanation in January 2011 after becoming acting county executive.)

Those were the major health care changes.

So, how much money did the county save? From 2006 through 2010, an estimated $130 million, according to calculations by the county auditor’s office and the employee benefits division.

That doesn’t mean the county health care bill is dropping. The $123.7 million the county spent in 2006 dropped by 1 percent in 2007, county figures show. But since then it has risen each year to the $139.6 million that was budgeted for 2010.

What Holloway meant is that the county spent an estimated $130 million less on health care than it would have if the county remained in the fully insured plan that was put in place by Walker.

Now, how much credit for the savings does Holloway deserve?

The consensus among seven key figures we interviewed was that many people were involved in achieving the savings. But the view also was that Holloway took most of the leadership role, while the Walker administration played more of a supportive role.

A spokesman for Walker declined comment.

Holloway’s major public initiative was the new employee benefits division. That gave the county expertise to negotiate the early release from the WPS contract and to bargain a less expensive deal with UnitedHealthcare. The county estimates the change saved nearly $49 million.

Holloway’s other contributions were behind the scenes.

According to county auditor Jerome Heer, Holloway’s leadership was crucial in boosting employee contributions for health benefits, which saved an estimated $44 million.

Heer also said that if Holloway had not made reducing health care expenses a priority, the county would have stayed with the costlier fully insured plan put in place by Walker. Changing from fully insured to self insured saved an estimated $37 million.

Offering a different view were County Supervisor Paul Cesarz and former supervisor Richard Nyklewicz. They said the savings were achieved through collaborative efforts of Holloway, the County Board, county staff and others.

So, how do we size all of this up?

County figures support Holloway’s claim that the county saved more than $100 million on health care bills -- in terms of what it would have spent had changes not been made. As for credit, no one argues that Holloway dug into the nuts and bolts of the changes the county made. As the County Board chairman, Holloway’s role was leadership, and he played a key -- though far from solo -- role.

To put it another way:

Holloway didn’t dribble the basketball the full length of the court before taking his shot -- he got an assist from his teammates. But his shot did go in. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/24/lee-holloway/acting-milwaukee-co-executive-lee-holloway-say/

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says shrink-wrapped cash sent to Iraq illustrates government misspending
","
Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich blasts the Iraq war every chance he gets. With Republicans promising budget cuts now that they’ve taken control of the U.S. House of Representatives, it’s not surprising what’s at the top of Kucinich’s list of potential trims.

""To meet your stated purpose of protecting American taxpayers from waste, fraud and abuse, it is essential that you examine the Department of Defense and money wasted during unnecessary wars,"" Kucinich said in a Jan. 4 letter to Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican.

Kucinich has also taken to television to make his case for Defense Department cuts. He alleged outrageous abuses during a Jan. 6 interview with Fox News anchor Jon Scott.

""Listen, when you can have a Defense Department that can shrink wrap $10.8 billion in American money, load it on 175 pallets and put it on a, on a transport plane and ship it to Iraq where they pass out $100 bills and no one has any receipts, when you know that kind of waste is going on, . . . we have concerns in this country that we have to start taking care of, and it's important that we track the misspending that's going on through the Department of Defense so that we can keep that money for the things we need at home,"" Kucinich said.

We thought it would be worth investigating Kucinich’s claim that the Pentagon loaded billions of shrink-wrapped U.S. dollars onto transport planes and flew them to Iraq, where these $100 bills were dispensed out without receipts.

Kucinich spokesman Nathan White said his boss’ claim stemmed from a February 2007 House Oversight Committee hearing conducted by the committee’s then-chairman, Henry Waxman of California, which examined massive shipments of U.S. currency to Iraq as part of the war effort.

A transcript of that hearing indicates the money at issue consisted of nearly $12 billion in cash that the Federal Reserve (not the Defense Department) sent to Iraq on C-130 cargo planes, mainly in shrink-wrapped packages of $100 bills, between May 2003 and June 2004. The money wasn’t U.S. tax dollars – it came from Iraqi oil sales that were put in a development fund for the Iraqi people. It was sent in cash because no banks or financial system existed in Iraq immediately after the U.S. occupation. Some of the money was used to stabilize the country by launching large public works programs to create jobs. Much of it was given to Iraqi ministries to pay the salaries and pensions of Iraqi civil servants who hadn’t had a paycheck since before the war. Although the Iraqi ministries lacked good payroll records, former Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator Paul Bremer told the committee that delaying their payments until better records were available would have been ""demoralizing and unfair"" to millions of Iraqi families, and ""might well have exacerbated danger to the American soldiers on the ground.""

""Under Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi government had been by far the country’s largest employer, providing about four out of five of all jobs,"" Bremer testified. ""But for several months, since before the war, millions of Iraqi families had not received money owed them for civil service, salaries or pensions.""

Special Inspector for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen, who was charged with auditing money sent to Iraq for reconstruction, told the committee that more should have been done to track how the money was spent. His auditors said nearly $9 billion was improperly accounted for. In a recent interview, he stressed that his findings didn’t mean all that money was used improperly, although his office found cases of graft that totaled in the tens of millions of dollars. He said 44 people have been convicted of crimes uncovered by his office.

""There were weak controls that made the money susceptible to waste and abuse,"" said Bowen. ""The money was given to these interim Iraqi ministries who spent it and used it as they chose. The fact that it was Iraqi money didn’t in any way diminish our duty to make sure we carried out our fiduciary responsibilities. It was not well managed and not well accounted for.""

Bowen’s office released an audit last year that found inadequate accounting for $8.7 billion of another $9.1 billion in subsequent shipments of Iraqi cash that the Defense Department sent to Iraq after January 2004. It found several cases of bribery, fraud and money laundering by U.S. officials that resulted in eight criminal convictions and $7.8 million in fines, forfeitures and restitution payments, the report said.

Kucinich’s spokesman did not respond to questions asking why Kucinich told Fox that $10.8 billion was at issue, when $12 billion was the amount discussed by Waxman’s committee. Bowen said he wasn’t familiar with any cases where $10.8 billion were shipped to Iraq on 175 pallets, as Kucinich claimed, though he applauded Kucinich’s advocacy for effective Iraq oversight.

""He is one of the reasons why the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has been able to succeed in the last seven years of work,"" Bowen said of Kucinich. 


Pentagon spending may be a legitimate place to look for budget cuts, but money misspent from this source could not be used ""for the things we need at home.""

For these reasons, we rate his claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/24/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-shrink-wrapped-cash-iraq-/
"['Federal Budget', 'Virginia', 'Jamie Radtke']","
Jamie Radtke says debt grew by $16,000 every second of George Allen's senate term
","
Jamie Radtke was not being kind when she said Americans are indebted for George Allen’s former service in the U.S. Senate.

Radtke, a Tea Party organizer, is the first announced candidate in an expected large GOP primary field for the U.S. Senate next year.  Allen, a fellow Republican, is signalling he’s on the verge of declaring he will seek to regain the seat he held for one term before losing to Democrat Jim Webb in 2006.

Radtke fired a warning shot at Allen along with a challenge to meet monthly across Virginia and debate ""the serious problems facing America.""

""For example, during Sen. Allen’s six years in office, he voted for budgets adding $3.1 trillion to the national debt -- that’s $16,400 for every second Sen. Allen was in office,"" Radtke said in a Jan. 17 news release.

That’s the price of a brand new, four-door Chevy Cobalt for ever second Allen was in the Senate  2001 and 2007, according to a Google search. We revved our engines to see if Radtke is right.

Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for Radtke, said they based their calculation on  the national debt growth between the last day of 2001 and the final day of 2007.

That was a mistake.  The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The first spending votes Allen cast in the Senate were for the budget that began Oct. 1, 2001 -- some three months before Radtke started counting.

And the last spending votes Allen cast were for the budget that started Oct. 1, 2006 -- five weeks before his defeat -- and ended Sept. 30, 2007. That’s some three months before Radtke stopped counting.

So our period runs from Oct. 1, 2001 to Sept. 30, 2007.

Next, we visited a U.S. Department of Treasury website to determine the national debt on each date. Rounding off, it started at $5.806 trillion and ended at $9.008 trillion.

That means federal budgets passed during Allen’s term increased debt by $3.202 trillion. Did the former Senator approve all of it?

Congress does not hold simple up or down votes on the federal budget. Instead, it votes on a series of appropriations for various department. We turned to THOMAS, a Library of Congress web site that records the action on Capitol Hill. We found Allen supported each of about four dozen  appropriation bills that came to Senate floor during his term.

So we made no deductions from the $3.202 trillion increase in debt.

Allen served 2,193 days in the Senate -- from Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 4, 2007. That’s 189,475,200 seconds.

He voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 per second. That’s almost $497 a second more than Radtke credited to Allen. So we’ve added a kickin’ stereo to the basic features of our Chevy Cobalt.

But before you get angry at Allen, consider this: The debt has risen by $54,684.24 a second since he left office. And Webb has voted ""yea"" on each 27 appropriations bills that helped get it there.

In case you’re wondering, we have now upgraded to a brand new, fully-loaded Lincoln Navigator every second. We’re talking about a luxury SUV with leather seats, parking sensors, GPS, rain-detecting wipers and sound that will make you think you’re in Carnegie Hall.

Only problem is it gets 14 miles a gallon, so it will cost us down the road.

Let’s review

Radtke said the Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,400 every second he was in the Senate. Her formula was a bit flawed; the actual figure is $16,896.68 a second.

We find it hard to penalize Radtke for a slight mistake she made in her opponent’s favor. So we rate her statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/24/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-debt-grew-16000-every-second-geo/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Lamar Smith']","
Lamar Smith says that the Obama administration said the health care overhaul would reduce costs, but now acknowledge it will dramatically increase costs.
","
U.S. House Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, recently said Congress should start over on health care reform ""and do it much better and do it right."" 
In an interview that aired Jan. 5, before the new GOP-controlled House voted to repeal the law, Smith also told Austin's KUT, 90.5 FM: ""Despite the (Obama) administration telling us it was going to reduce health care costs, they now acknowledge it's going to dramatically increase health care costs."" 
Has Obama backpedaled on the law's cost impact? 
He has certainly said the law would cut costs. In a September 2009 interview, he said health care reform was ""going to start driving down our costs over the long term."" In November 2009, he said: ""The bill that the House has produced will provide stability and security for Americans who have insurance; quality, affordable options for those who don't; and lower costs for American families and business. And as I've insisted from the beginning, it is a bill that is fully paid for and will actually reduce our long-term federal debt."" And in April, Obama said: ""Over time, costs will come down for families, businesses, and the federal government, reducing our deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next two decades. That's what reform will do."" 
Smith spokeswoman Sally-Shannon Scales told us in an e-mail that an April 22 memo — by ""the president's own actuary at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"" — shows the administration's shift. 
Scales was referring to the Office of the Actuary within the CMS, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
The heads of both agencies are Obama appointees, though we learned that the office's chief actuary, Richard Foster, is not. Foster told us via e-mail that the actuary ""by statute and by longstanding past practice...operates independently, on a nonpartisan basis, in providing actuarial, economic and other technical information to the administration, Congress and the public."" According to U.S. Code, the actuary performs ""in accordance with professional standards of actuarial independence."" 
The actuary's April memo opens by saying the office was analyzing health care costs in its ""longstanding capacity as an independent technical advisor to both the administration and the Congress... The statements, estimates and other information provided in this memorandum are those of the Office of the Actuary and do not represent an official position of the Department of Health and Human Services or the administration."" 
The memo also cautions that the actuary's estimates were just that, calling the law's impact on health expenditures ""very uncertain."" 
Broadly, the memo estimates that national spending on health care will increase $311 billion from 2010 through 2019 — which is nearly 1 percent more than what would have been spent without the law largely because 34 million more people are expected to obtain insurance. 
""Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals and families with health insurance use more health services than otherwise-similar persons without insurance,"" the memo says. ""Although several provisions would help reduce health care cost growth, their impact would be more than offset through 2019 by the higher health expenditures resulting from coverage expansions."" Over time, provisions designed to help control costs ""would have a noticeable downward effect on the level of national health expenditures,"" though the memo airs doubts that the provisions, such as reducing Medicare payments to health care providers, would be sustainable. 
Foster told us that since the April memo, the office ""hasn't changed its estimate that total U.S. health expenditures will increase somewhat,"" and the Obama administration also hasn't backed off its stance. 
A day after the memo appeared, a White House official objected. On The White House Blog, Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, wrote: ""There are some areas where we disagree with the actuary, particularly when it comes to the new law and the growth of health care costs."" 
DeParle wrote that the actuary ""discounts proposals that other independent experts credit with getting at the root causes of health care cost growth,"" such as state health insurance exchanges, which DeParle said will ""set up a competition choice system that would pressure insurers to lower premiums."" 
Obama's wasn't the first administration to disagree with the actuary. Previously, an investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services found that a CMS administrator appointed by George W. Bush threatened to fire Foster ""if he told Congress that drug benefits would probably cost much more than the White House acknowledged,"" according to a July 2004 New York Times news article. ""As a result, Mr. Foster's cost estimate did not become known until after the legislation was enacted."" 
When we followed up with Scales, she pointed us to a Fox News clip of Obama posted Sept. 10 on Real Clear Politics, a politics website. In it, Obama says the administration knew it would cost money to insure 30 million additional people, adding: ""We didn't think we were going to cover 30 million people for free. But that the longterm trend in terms of how much the average family is going to be paying for health insurance is going to be improved as a consequence of health care."" 
The president was responding to a reporter's question about another study on the health care law, by another team from the actuary's office. The study estimated that the law would have ""negligible effects on total national health spending in the next 10 years, neither slowing nor fueling the explosive growth of medical costs,"" according to a Sept. 9 Times news article. 
The actuary's September report says about 32.5 million people will obtain health coverage through 2019, and national health spending will grow at an annual rate of 6.3 percent — 0.2 percent more than it would without the law. 
This estimate, like the April one, covers all health care spending by state, federal, local and private entities. In contrast, a March projection by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked solely at how federal spending would change, stating that the law would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10 years. 
Upshot: Twice last year, a federal authority that is statutorily independent from the president estimated the law would increase total national health care expenditures — pegging the impact at less than 1 percent above what would be spent on health care without the law. 
We don't see the projected upticks as dramatic, as Smith puts it. The actuary didn't apply such labels. We also don't see Obama acknowledging the actuary's September estimate as a shift. Then and to date, Obama has maintained the law will ultimately cut costs. 
We rate Smith's statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jan/23/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-obama-administration-said-health-/

Victoria Taft says Rigler Elementary gave prayer room, rugs, special treatment to Muslim students
","
Remember that whole separation of church and state thing? Well, according to a recent blog post by local radio personality Victoria Taft, the wall dividing the two is crumbling over at Portland's Rigler Elementary School.

In her missive, Taft writes that ""Muslim students at Portland's Rigler Elementary School are given their own school provided prayer room, prayer rugs, helpfully stored in the prayer room by the school, and let out of class five times a day to pray to Allah. Did I mention this is during school hours?""

If this sounds a little dubious, she backs it up in the Dec. 27, 2010, post: ""School officials AND the PPS spokesman confirmed before I went on the air with this earlier this month.""

There's a lot more in her post, but she keeps coming back to the idea that Muslim students are getting exceptional treatment. Here's another sentence along those lines: ""The school stores the Muslim prayer rugs for the students in a special room and they roll them all out for the kids five times a day.""

So is any of this true? Well, according to Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby, it's not. In fact, as much as we like to keep up on our talk radio, this whole issue flew under our radar until we received an e-mail from Shelby asking us to debunk the claim.

We read over Taft's original post and found it provocative enough to deem it worth a look.

One claim that caught our attention straight away: It didn't seem right that Muslim students would be praying five times during the school day.

It's true, some Muslims pray five times a day, but most of those prayers don't fall during the school day. Rigler's school day runs from 8 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. The five prayers traditionally take place before dawn, just after noon, midafternoon, at sunset and before bed. Of those five prayers, only one (possibly two) would seem to conflict with the school schedule.

With that in mind, we gave Shelby a call.

He reiterated some of what he had told us in previous e-mails. He was contacted by Taft's producer, who said the show had received a complaint from a relative of a teacher that Muslim students were being singled out for special treatment. Shelby said he told the producer he would look into it, but, in the end, for no reason in particular, they never actually spoke about the situation. When he saw the blog post, he contacted Rigler and was told nobody there spoke with Taft or a producer for her show. (Taft still maintains a school official confirmed her report, though she declined to give us the name of that official.)

So, we asked, how did any of this crop up in the first place?

Well, Shelby said, four years ago, two brothers at Rigler asked for permission to pray at lunch during Ramadan, an Islamic holy month. The students were allowed to do so in an empty office. The school, he said, did not convert the office to a prayer room; the two were simply to pray in private. The students prayed just once a day and no rugs were provided.

Shelby then pointed us to a couple of memos from Portland Public Schools’ general counsel Jollee Faber Patterson. One of the memos deals with religious instruction in school and makes clear that teachers should neither encourage nor discourage religious expression -- no matter the faith.

In another memo, this one dealing specifically with special requests during Ramadan, Patterson suggests that schools ""should accommodate reasonable requests."" This, she writes, would include giving students access to a quiet place to pray and excusing students from physical education should they be fasting during the day (as is custom during Ramadan).

Shelby says Portland Public Schools has made allowances for children of other faiths as well. At one elementary school, Christian students are allowed to miss class in order to participate in religious studies off campus. A few years back, Wilson High School rescheduled a graduation ceremony to accommodate Jewish students who were observing Shabbat. Other schools keep the Sabbath in mind when scheduling Friday night and weekend activities, Shelby said.

""It's all over the board, and we try to accommodate our kids as best we can,"" Shelby said.  

After talking to Shelby, we tried to get in touch with Taft to see if she stood by her blog post. She referred us only to an updated blog post that went up the night after we asked for comment. In her new post, she says she may have ""conflated his (Shelby’s) ‘checking it out’ with the other confirmations but it's not a lie -- intentional or otherwise.""

She then goes on to dissect a response from Shelby, which reads, in part: ""Rigler School does not have any students that pray as part of their school day. This includes, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Mormons and other groups mentioned in the article. Consequently, the school does not have any space or equipment devoted to any type of religious practice at school. Four years ago, Rigler did have two brothers who asked permission to pray during their lunch during Ramadan. The school did give them a quiet space to use; they missed no instructional time to do so and only prayed once a day. Those are the facts.""

Taft cites this as proof that her original post was accurate. She says, ""Shelby confirms that the district has provided a spot at the school to pray.""

It's true, he does. But Taft’s original post went much further than that. She said that the students were praying five times a day (instead of once), that the school let them out of class (it was during lunch), that the school gave them a prayer room (it was an unused office) and prayer rugs (nope), and that other religions would not be similarly accommodated (they are).

We tried to get in touch with Taft one last time to let her address these loose ends. She declined.  ""I'll just leave my comments as is,"" she wrote in an e-mail.

Well, given that, we find the claim to be not only false but ridiculous: Pants on Fire.

Senator Reed says New England has ample supplies of natural gas
","
For years, Weaver’s Cove Energy, the company that wants to develop a liquefied natural gas terminal in Fall River, has battled critics in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, who have fought the project on several fronts.

Opponents say the terminal -- and massive tankers making regular trips through Narragansett Bay -- would pose a serious safety risk to communities on Mount Hope Bay and cause widespread environmental damage. They also say the region already has enough natural gas and doesn’t need a new terminal.

The four U.S. senators from the two states, who all oppose the terminal, cited the supply argument in a letter they sent in November to a key Senate appropriations committee, urging it to prohibit the Federal Regulatory Commission from using federal money to approve the terminal.

With temperatures plummeting –– and the Weaver’s Cove project far from resolved –– we thought this was a good time to delve into the issue, focusing on the senators’ claim that New England has ample supplies of natural gas, and therefore doesn’t need the new terminal. We chose Sen. Jack Reed as the speaker for this item because he issued a news release about the letter.

The senators cited an analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) that was summarized in a Nov. 16, 2009 letter the department sent to federal regulators: ""DOER asserts that it is unclear to what extent, if any, Weaver Cove’s LNG supply is needed to meet the region’s gas supply needs. . .""

In the letter, the Massachusetts energy office staff reported that within the past year, two new or expanded LNG facilities were completed in the Northeast,  adding to the ""large excess supply already in the natural gas market.""

They also cited other increased supplies and a drop in demand for natural gas. Those were among many changes in the region’s electricity and natural gas marketplace that occurred since the Weaver’s Cove project was first initiated in 2002, they said.  As a result, they said, ""it is unclear why there would be demand for additional LNG infrastructure.""

We then found Damien Gaul, an analyst for the Energy Information Administration, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. Gaul referred us to a recent administration projection showing natural gas demand nationally increasing from 23 trillion cubic feet in 2008 to 26.4 trillion cubic feet in 2035, a growth rate of .6 percent annually.

""We don’t believe the U.S. has a need for more LNG deliveries,"" said Gaul, who emphasized his agency does not issue opinions on specific LNG proposals.

""We currently have the capacity to handle five times the demand we have now. Does the U.S. need more LNG? Probably not. Does the Northeast need more? Probably not.""

The natural gas supply issue also arose at a hearing for electric utility National Grid before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission on Oct. 20, 2010.

Elizabeth D. Arangio, U.S. director of gas supply planning for National Grid, said several new sources of gas have been created in the Northeast, with more to come soon. She concluded: ""So at this point, the market doesn’t technically need more supply in this area in addition to those projects ...""

At the same hearing, Bruce Oliver, a consultant hired by the PUC, said the recession has reduced the demand for LNG. ""That is, the overall demand in the region has declined due to the economy and other factors, energy-efficiency activity, etc. That activity negates a lot of the factors that were driving the need for a Weaver’s Cove type of supply.""

So why would Weaver’s Cove spend millions of dollars fighting to develop a project to deliver a product to a market that doesn’t need it?

We asked Gordon Shearer, president of Hess LNG LLC, who has spearheaded the Weaver’s Cove project. He responded with a question: If New England has enough gas, he asked, why are prices for natural gas here much higher than in the rest of the country? (Gas prices vary widely across the country; the EIA finds prices in New England are generally several dollars higher per thousand cubic feet than the national average.) The high prices, Shearer said, show the region needs more gas.

He also said the Massachusetts Energy Office used faulty arithmetic in its study and failed to note that existing pipelines don’t have enough capacity to handle much of the new LNG supplies. He also dismissed the federal reports, saying commercial forecasters tend to see a need for more imports.

But documents Shearer provided told a mixed story. For instance, a report from Spectra Energy described the company’s efforts to pipe more gas to the Northeast, but it said nothing about the need for more gas from other sources.   

Another report, the 2010 Statistical Guide by the Northeast Gas Association, reports that ""an era of abundant supplies appears to have arrived"" and that is having a positive impact on natural gas prices.

The rapid development of shale gas supplies in New York and Pennsylvania are expected to  produce substantially more gas for the U.S. market, the report said. It noted that some proposed LNG projects, including one offshore of New Jersey, have been withdrawn recently because of the changing market conditions.

To summarize: The Massachusetts and federal energy offices say there is an ample supply of natural gas. So does National Grid, the largest local utility.

Weaver’s Cove contention -- that the region’s relatively high gas prices prove there’s not enough supply -- may make theoretical sense. But it hasn’t convinced the regulators so far. Nor us.

We find the claim by Reed and the other senators to be True. 
Update: The original version of this item incorrectly reported that National Grid, a major supplier of electricity and natural gas, burns natural gas to produce electricity.

Rep. Jefferson Smith says classical music pilot program shows 41 percent reduction in crime at MAX light-rail stop
","

East Multnomah County state Rep. Jefferson Smith, D-Portland, has introduced House Bill 2909 to require TriMet to broadcast classical music at MAX light-rail stations in high-crime areas.

The jokes are swirling already. Would you like a little Vivaldi with that mugging? Maybe it’s more like, I’d like to harass that innocent bystander but this Chopin is making me feel so mellow. Or even, this classical music is so annoying that I’m going to take my trouble-making self elsewhere.

But scoffing aside, PolitiFact Oregon was intrigued by a statement Smith made to The Oregonian’s Michelle Cole. A test last month at the MAX station at 162nd Avenue and Burnside, he said, saw ""crime was down 41 percent from the December a year ago.""

We checked with the representative’s office, who directed us to the Portland Police Bureau for the results. Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson confirmed -- as does this online post by Portland Police Sgt. John Scruggs  -- that TriMet installed a classical music system at that light-rail station on Nov. 16. Simpson said there is no official report, but the numbers are as follows:
  
From Nov. 16, 2009 to Dec. 16, 2009, there were 46 calls for service. 
From Nov. 16, 2010 to Dec. 16, 2010, there were 27 calls for service. 

The math is correct. There is a 41 to 42 percent difference in the number of service calls between the time periods.

But a call for service doesn’t necessarily indicate criminal activity. A service call can be for anything from disorderly conduct to a fare check, Simpson said. They can be generated by an officer who decides to check out a station, or by someone calling in a request for help.

And this is why Sgt. Scruggs was more careful in his post: ""The first month of data for our attempt has shown a 42% reduction in calls for service at 162nd/ Burnside.  We are going to do a more comprehensive study soon.""

""I think it’s a good indication that it’s working, but it’s early numbers, early stats,"" Scruggs said in an interview.

In his interview with Cole, Smith readily acknowledged that statistics based on one month merit more review. He stressed the numbers were preliminary. This week, his legislative assistant forwarded more information from Scruggs that show a 40 percent reduction in calls for service at that stop over a two-month period. Three other stops without classical music showed increases in service calls. Again, this is all early data. 
PolitiFact Oregon enjoys classical music. If it actually helps reduce crime at light-rail stations, that’s great, but we’re not weighing in on that broader question. Our focus is on the recent test. In an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Smith said he may have used the two terms -- ""crime"" and ""service calls"" -- interchangeably when talking to Cole, inaccurately conflating the two.

We rate the claim Mostly True -- accurate but needing just a little bit of clarification.

Gov. Bob McDonnell claims his $4 billion transportation plan will generate thousands of jobs
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell has been pitching his $4 billion transportation plan as a vehicle that will deliver thousands of new jobs to Virgina.

""It is estimated that every $100 million spent on construction generates 3,000 new jobs,"" McDonnell, a Republican, said in his State of the Commonwealth address on Jan. 12.

We kicked the tires on the governor’s claim.

A spokesman for the governor steered us to a 2007 report by the Federal Highway Administration that examined the effect of road construction on jobs. The paper updated similar studies from 1997 and 2005.

The FHWA says highway spending can create three types of jobs. There are construction jobs where people work directly on a road project or work to produce materials like the concrete, signs and guardrails. You also have supporting jobs, such as at a firm that makes sheet steel and sells it to the company that makes guardrails.

And finally there are ""induced"" positions, which the FHWA says ""includes all of the jobs supported by consumer expenditures resulting from wages"" in the other two categories. For example, when the road builder and the guardrail maker go to lunch, the money they spend helps keep the waiter and chef employed, meaning their jobs are partially supported by wages earned from road construction.

The report says $100 million in spending supports 1,030 construction jobs, 467.5 support industry jobs and 1,509.4 induced jobs. Add those figures up and you get 3,006.9 jobs.

But, as TBD.com reporter Kevin Robillard pointed out when he examined the claim, the FHWA report has caveats. Some highway projects require spending to purchase right-of-way for new lanes or ramps, meaning there is less money available to spend on those construction workers. The FHWA says the average Federal-aid highway project has historically used 7 percent of its funds for land purchases. Those purchases would reduce the jobs created to 2,780 for each $100 million spent.

And while the road crews would be working in Virginia, if any supplies came from outside of Virginia, then the state’s spending would be supporting jobs elsewhere. There is also no guarantee that the support industries or induced jobs will hire in the expected proportion.

We called Bill Hecox, spokesman for the FHWA, to talk about the report. He warned us the employment figures ""can change daily, or at least seasonally, because they vary with labor and material prices.""

Hecox said the FHWA has been down this road recently as reporters and politicians asked the agency to determine how many jobs were created by federal stimulus spending. The answers, he said, were really hard to come by because the seasonal nature of construction jobs and different conditions in each state make each road project unique.

The spokesman also noted that spending sometimes has a role in preserving existing jobs rather than creating new ones. But he again warned of the difficulty of precisely calculating the value of the trickle-down spending.

""It gets indirect, and how many ripples do you count?"" he asked. ""Do you count the guy selling bread to the restaurant? The tire company selling tires for the bread truck?""

And if the current economic environment has taught us anything, it’s that improved spending and economic performance do not necessarily equal new jobs. American companies are increasingly adept at making do with a smaller number of more efficient workers. At some point might the company making guardrails decide it would rather invest in more efficient machinery and pay some overtime rather than hiring a new shift of workers?

The report says that $100 million in spending ""supports"" 3,000 jobs. That is different from ""generated,"" which was the governor’s term. The FHWA says the jobs figure ""includes ‘new jobs’ to the extent unemployed labor is hired; ‘better jobs’ as currently employed workers move into jobs with higher compensation and/or full-time positions; and ‘sustained jobs’ as current employees are retained with the expenditure.""

These jobs are temporary. Spending $100 million creates 3,000 ""person-years,"" the FHWA says, meaning it can support 3,000 jobs for one year or 1,500 for two years (or any other combination). But unless more money comes along, the positions don’t last.

Let's review. 
McDonnell drew the data from a reputable government source. He used the most recent version of the study in making his claim. But there are several flaws in his conclusion.

He wrongly says $100 million in construction ""generates 3,000 new jobs.""

The FHWA says each $100 million block of spending ""supported"" 3,000 jobs, not created or generated. Much of that $100 million would preserve existing jobs, not create new ones,

And of those ""supported"" jobs, just one-third are directly tied to the construction project. More than half are supposed to stem from trickle-down spending as the wages received by construction or other road-related workers are spent. If the wages get diverted to paying down credit card debt or saving for retirement, that spending is diminished.

McDonnell had some rich data in his tank and overshot his exit. We rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/22/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-claims-his-4-billion-transportat/

Rick Perry says first word spoken from moon was ""Houston""
","
Gov. Rick Perry praised Texans for their ""resilience"" and ""resourcefulness"" during his Jan. 18 inauguration speech, saying that ""if something has never been done before, it's just because we haven't tried it."" 
Among the accomplishments Perry credited to Texans was pioneering space. ""Matter of fact,"" he said, ""the first word spoken from the moon was 'Houston.' "" 
That statement drew shouts and applause from the crowd — and our attention. 
We'd heard the boast before. Last year, for instance, Reagan Outdoor Advertising placed this message — ""Houston"" First Word Spoken On The Moon — on billboards in the Salt Lake City area. We saw them in Austin, too. We also read the statement in several articles, including a 2001 Philadelphia Inquirer travel story about Texas' largest city. 
All refer to the instantly historic line uttered July 20, 1969, by NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong to a worldwide television and radio audience and the folks in mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston after he and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module, Eagle, on the moon: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" 
At first, we were confident that Perry had it right. However, research raised doubts — especially after we saw YouTube posts of video and audio from the landing that suggested some technical communications by the astronauts took place after the landing and before Armstrong said ""Houston."" 
We turned next to experts both in and out of NASA, including two authors of books on the Apollo 11 mission and the editor of the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, an online resource that's featured on NASA's website. The Journal includes a transcript of everything said by the astronauts and NASA officials on the ground. 
What was the first word said by man on the moon? The experts' answers differed, with most agreeing it was not ""Houston."" 
David Harland — author of The First Men on the Moon: The Story of Apollo 11 — told us by e-mail: ""Technically, the first utterance would have been Aldrin saying 'contact light,' which occurred when one of the probes projecting from ... the landing legs made contact with the surface."" The light alerted the astronauts when the lunar module had touched the moon. 
According to the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, the next word spoken — after ""contact light"" — was ""shutdown"" by Armstrong, who was alerting Aldrin that he had turned off the engine. 
Andrew Chaikin, author of A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts, told us that he considers ""shutdown"" to be the first word uttered on the moon. 
Eric Jones — editor of the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal — agreed. He told us that after consulting the transcripts and the November 1969 NASA report on the Apollo 11 mission, he concluded that ""shutdown"" was the first word spoken after the lunar module landed. 
The next words came from Aldrin, according to the Journal transcript: ""Okay. Engine stop."" 
At NASA, spokesman Joshua Buck said this was the key moment. ""After checking online, it seems that the very first word on the moon was seconds after landing and said by Buzz Aldrin. It was 'OK,'"" Buck told us in an e-mail. 
After ""engine stop,"" there was a brief technical exchange between Armstrong and Aldrin that Jones said was part of the post-shutdown process. Next, mission control in Houston chimed in: ""We copy you down, Eagle,"" said Charles Duke, who was Apollo 11's capsule communicator, the only person authorized to talk directly to the crew. 
According to the Journal's transcript, Armstrong then said to Aldrin, ""Engine arm is off,"" before addressing mission control directly with: ""Houston ..."" 
About 20 seconds passed — and about 30 words were spoken — between Aldrin's ""contact light"" and Armstrong's ""Houston."" 
Facing all these different answers to the first-word question — none of which were ""Houston"" — we sought clarity from Bill Barry, NASA's chief historian. 
No luck: Barry told us that there are ""a range of right answers."" He said ""contact light"" was one possibility because those words were uttered the moment that the module touched the surface of the moon. 
""The next option,"" he said, is the first word spoken after all four of the module's foot pads came to rest on the moon. It's not clear exactly when that happened, Barry said, but it probably occurred as the astronauts were running down their post-shutdown ""checklist"" — ""like the one you do every day, but probably don't say aloud, when you park your car."" 
But Barry said that because the checklist was part of a long-rehearsed procedural script, he is ""inclined toward saying that the first 'intentional' words spoken on the moon were Armstrong's report to Houston that they had landed."" 
Keeping score? That's one vote for ""Houston"" and four for some other words. 
Barry offered yet another take on the issue, saying that if you start from the moment humans stepped on the lunar surface for the first time, the first words spoken on the moon would be Armstrong's most famous statement: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" 
We had one more question for Barry: How much of the procedural exchange between the astronauts did the millions of people hear as they listened to the moon landing on radio and television? Barry told us that they would have heard everything said by Aldrin, including ""contact light"" and ""Okay. Engine stop,"" because he was making all his checklist calls and observations over the radio. Armstrong's communications were captured by the on-board recorder, Barry said, but were not broadcast on the radio unless he pushed a button — as Armstrong did when he announced, ""Houston ... The Eagle has landed."" 
We laid out our research for Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, who responded by saying: ""We stand by the governor's inaugural remarks."" 
Now, to the Truth-O-Meter. 
We understand the everlasting appeal of Houston as the first word flung from the moon. However, we were surprised to learn, it's not so. Armstrong's call from the moon to mission control was preceded by various other and easy-to-overlook words. 
We rate Perry's statement as False.",/factchecks/2011/jan/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-first-word-spoken-moon-was-houston/
"['Crime', 'Poverty', 'Florida', 'Bob Buckhorn']","
Bob Buckhorn says there was no panhandling when he left the Tampa City Council
","A key element of Bob Buckhorn's campaign for mayor is reducing small, quality-of-life crimes before they turn into bigger crimes. Think public urination, ""raves"" at bars or Tampa's famous ""six-foot rule"" for lap dancers that Buckhorn pushed. He's also been a major advocate for cracking down on panhandling.

Last summer, St. Petersburg's ban on panhandling put the issue on the front burner. The Tampa City Council is poised to pass a ban for major streets after refusing to do so three times in recent months. Many residents are frustrated. Candidates in the March 31 mayoral race get a lot of questions on the topic.

During a Jan. 4, 2011, interview on the ""AM Tampa Bay"" radio show on WFLA-AM 970, Buckhorn outlined a previous attempt to curb roadside begging.

""We passed an ordinance that allowed legitimate charities to apply for a permit once a year provided they had the right liability coverage, which allowed the Shriners and firefighters and some of the vendors to do what they've been doing for years without causing problems,"" he said. (That ordinance, passed in 1999, was nullified after a court tossed out a similar law in another town.)

He continued: ""There was no panhandling when I left office. Now we've seen it explode. We've seen an unwillingness on the part of some of the elected officials in our community to do anything about it.""

This leads to an obvious question: Really? Was there NO panhandling in Tampa when Buckhorn left office after two terms in 2003?

We turned to our archives for help and found a St. Petersburg Times story from March 2003 published three days after Tampa's municipal election and a few weeks before Buckhorn left office.

The article quotes a homeless person asking a business owner, ""Hey, hey. Can I get a dollar?"" According to the article, ""Scenes like that unfold hundreds of times a day on Ybor's busy Seventh Avenue strip.""

A little more color: ""Merchants say Ybor draws dozens of panhandlers — homeless men, mostly, who ply the strip with hard-luck stories. As the crowds grow, so do the number of people pleading for change.""

The prognosis isn't good for Buckhorn's claim. But maybe the Times got it wrong. Is it possible that ""dozens of panhandlers"" asking for cash ""hundreds of times a day"" was just a fluke that day? We asked a few people who would know if panhandling was eradicated in Tampa circa 2003.

There were 8,700 homeless people that year, according to an annual survey by the Homeless Coalition of Hillsborough County. In 2009, the latest year figures are available, that count was 9,500. It's hard to know exactly how many were panhandlers, but anecdotal evidence says there were at least a few.

""When Mr. Buckhorn left office, we didn't have one of the highest unemployment rates in recent memory,"" said coalition spokeswoman Lesa Weikel. ""Yes, there probably was some panhandling going on, but obviously not to the extent that it is now.""

Joe Howden is a longtime Ybor City resident and business manager who considers Buckhorn a friend. He said that he appreciates Buckhorn's efforts to deal with panhandling, but ""it's something that's never going to go away, in my opinion.""

""You just have to have the police keep pressure on people not to annoy people on the streets,"" he said.

Tampa police statistics show 283 panhandling arrests in 2002 and 2003, which includes aggressive panhandling and illegal begging in medians. Police spokeswoman Laura McElroy called that a ""totally different issue than what we're dealing with now. The more recent problem is just the large number of them.""

Buckhorn acknowledged on Jan. 18 that panhandling in Tampa wasn't wiped out. During the radio show, he said, he was referring to the fact that ""panhandling wasn't permitted in the medians. This was median-specific.""

He added: ""Panhandling has been around as long as human beings have been around. And it probably will continue to be.""

So Buckhorn clarified his radio interview comment when PolitiFact Florida asked him about it. But that doesn't change his original claim: ""There was no panhandling when I left office."" Several sources say that's just not true. There were plenty of people asking for spare change on Tampa's streets in 2003, though anecdotal evidence shows panhandling is up in Tampa now because of the bad economy and the ban in St. Petersburg. We rate Buckhorn's statement as False.",/factchecks/2011/jan/21/bob-buckhorn/bob-buckhorn-says-there-was-no-panhandling-when-he/

Tort reform in the health care law? No
","
We've never played a drinking game while watching C-SPAN, but  Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., suggested that people try it while listening to the debate Wednesday on a measure to repeal last year's health care law. A defender of the law, Weiner took aim at Republicans that he said would be making false claims.

""There are basically three formations of the argument by the Republicans: First, they start by making stuff up. You kind of have to wonder if any of them actually read the bill: 137 new agencies — not true; new IRS agents— not true; death panels — not true; Members aren't covered — not true; no tort reform in it — not true.

""You know, I want to just advise people watching at home playing that now popular drinking game of you take a shot whenever the Republicans say something that's not true, please assign a designated driver. This is going to be a long afternoon.""

Weiner was on fairly solid ground with most of his claims. We've debunked death panels (Pants on Fire); 15,000 new agents for the Internal Revenue Service (Barely True); 53 new government bureaucracies (Barely True); and members of Congress aren't covered by the health care bill (False).

But we stopped short at Weiner's claim that the health care law included tort reform.  Did it?

Before we get into details of the health care law, we should explain the basics of tort reform in plain language. What tort reform usually means is changing the rules that apply when patients sue their doctors for medical errors or malpractice. The thinking goes that if doctors weren't so afraid of being sued, they would order fewer tests -- they wouldn't practice ""defensive"" medicine -- and that would drive down health care costs. On the other hand, patients who believe they have been harmed by doctors want to keep their right to sue, or at least get some sort of payment.

Policy wonks have been trying to come up with new ideas to balance those concerns, such as protections for doctors who can show their actions followed evidence-based medical guidelines.

Still, when talking about federal tort reform, the usual ideas are:

• Caps on the amount of money juries can award injured patients.
• To let jurors consider patients' other sources of income when making awards.
• To create ""fair share"" rules that let jurors assign damages based on how much the doctor or hospital contributed to the injury. 
There's nothing like that in the health care law, which passed Congress in March.

Still, we got in touch with Weiner's office, and they pointed us to pages 686 and 891 of the final bill. These are the parts of the bill that authorize $50 million in funding for state projects that develop, implement and evaluate ""alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving disputes over injuries allegedly caused by health care providers or health care organizations.""

Given the size of the health care system, that's a tiny amount of money. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office evaluated whether the state pilot projects would reduce the government's health spending and declined to assign any cost savings to the program. On the other hand, the CBO found that traditional ideas on tort reform could reduce government health spending by $54 billion over 10 years.

Finally, we turned to the advocacy groups that monitor tort reform efforts. Darren McKinney, director of communications for the American Tort Reform Association, said he agreed with Weiner about death panels, but the idea that the law includes tort reform is ""demonstrably untrue, and it's not even close.""

He also pointed out a clause in the law that specifically says the state programs cannot limit people's right to sue, and that the pilot programs must allow patients to opt out of the alternatives ""at any time"" to pursue litigation. We confirmed those clauses in the final bill, on page 892.

Then there's a letter from the American Association for Justice, formerly known as the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. Soon after the health care bill became law, the group's president wrote this to the group's membership:

""I am very pleased to report that the health care bill is clear of any provisions that would limit an injured patient's rights concerning medical negligence claims. While there is a provision for demonstration projects, it provides an absolute opt-out clause for plaintiffs at any time. While some states may embark on demonstration programs we find objectionable, the opt-out provision for plaintiffs minimizes this concern. In short, this is a tremendous victory for all Americans.""

The letter then went on to outline the more traditional forms of tort reform that the association successfully fought to keep out of the bill.

Weiner is on firm ground when he said that there have been several notable falsehoods about the health care law. But in claiming that the law includes tort reform, he is significantly mischaracterizing the law. Although it has a tiny amount of money for state pilot projects that look at alternatives to litigation, they are so small that they were ignored by the leading group that opposes tort reform -- the trial lawyers. The group's president said the projects weren't anything to be concerned about. That puts the projects at such a great distance from any sort of traditional notion of tort reform that they're just not even in the same ballpark. We rate Weiner's statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jan/21/anthony-weiner/tort-reform-health-care-law-no/
"['Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Brian Moran']","
Democrat Brian Moran says Gov. Bob McDonnell has no plan for paying transportation debt
","
For the better part of a decade, the General Assembly has been stalled in debate over how to fund Virginia’s growing transportation needs.

The Senate has largely argued the state needs to dedicate new long-term revenues, such as a gas tax increase, to building roads. The Republican majority in the House has stood steadfast against tax hikes, insisting that the state scrape up transportation money by borrowing, earmarking budget surpluses during good years, increasing traffic fines and fees and a blend of other ideas.

The fight may return as the main event in this winter’s General Assembly session. Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, has proposed accelerating a borrowing plan approved in 2007, saying he wanted to issue $600 million in bonds annually over three years instead of $300 million annually over six years. And it didn’t take long for Brian Moran, chairman of the state Democratic Party, to attack.

Moran, in a statement released after the governor’s State of the Commonwealth address on Jan. 12, argued McDonnell has made a ""commitment to billions of dollars in debt and new spending without any explanation of how he plans to pay that money back.""

No explanation? We decided to check that out, particularly because PolitiFact Virginia discussed a payback plan in a Dec. 30 article.

After a quick search, we found our answer.

The Virginia Transportation Act of 2000 created the Priority Transportation Fund to help the state borrow money for roads, rail and public transportation. The bill directed that one-third of the state’s revenue from insurance premium taxes go into the fund. That portion is roughly equal  to the fraction of auto insurance premiums compared to total insurance premiums each year. A 2007 transportation bill again placed one-third of the insurance premium tax revenue in the fund.

Moran, who represented Alexandria in the House from 1996 to 2008, voted for both of the bills.
McDonnell noted that fact when he introduced his stepped-up borrowing plan on Dec. 8.

Moran e-mailed his statement saying McDonnell has offered no pay-back plan on Jan. 12 at 9 p.m. That was more than an hour after McDonnell completed his address to the legislators, saying the Virginia Department of Transportation ""already has the money necessary for debt service from the insurance premium tax you approved in 2007.""

When we called Moran, he acknowledged the governor would be accelerating the debt issuance ""as long as the premium revenue is sufficient to pay.""  

Ric Brown, the state’s secretary of finance, told us that one-third of the insurance tax premium will net about $131 million for the 2011 budget year, up from $128 million in 2010. That should more than cover the accelerated borrowing, he said.

When the state last borrowed for roads, in the spring of 2010, Brown said the bonds carried a 3.2 percent interest rate over 25 years. For every $100 million borrowed, he said, the state pays $3.2 million per year to cover interest and about $1.8 million in principal payments. So each year the state is paying about 5 percent of the bond’s total cost.

Brown said interest rates for Virginia’s debt are similar to the ones seen last year and have hovered between 3 percent and 3.5 percent for the past several months.

Let’s say Virginia issues $1.8 billion in 25-year bonds at the high end of that range, paying a 3.5 percent annual interest rate. When the interest and principal payments are combined, the state would be paying roughly 5.5 percent of the total bond value in annual payments.

Our calculator shows the debt would cost Virginia $99 million a year. That’s well below the $131 million in revenue received from the insurance taxes. And during the first two years the state would pay less, of course, because the entire $1.8 billion in debt would not have been issued.

Let’s review.

Moran said the governor made ""a commitment to billions of dollars in debt and new spending without any explanation of how he plans to pay the money back.""

With little effort, we found the explanation in five places easily available to Moran before he made his statement: 
When we called Moran, he didn’t try to defend his claim.

It’s absurd for Moran to say he was in the dark. We rate his claim: Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2011/jan/21/brian-moran/democrat-brian-moran-says-gov-bob-mcdonnell-has-no/

Mike Pence says Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill ""will kill jobs""
","After the global economic crisis of 2008, President Barack Obama and Democratic lawmakers promised to pass a bill that would strengthen regulation of financial markets. The result was the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

The law is complex -- here is a summary assembled by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee -- but in general, the bill created an independent consumer protection agency, established new ways to liquidate failed financial firms, created a council to warn about systemic risks to the financial system and tighten regulatory scrutiny of the financial system while increasing transparency.

The measure was controversial. When it passed the House and the Senate, it did so with only three Republicans voting for it in each chamber.

On July 15, 2010, shortly after the Senate passed the measure, then-House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence, R-Ind., released a statement critical of the bill. In part, it said, ""This so-called financial reform bill will kill jobs, raise taxes, restrict the flow of credit, make bailouts permanent and turn the Democrats’ disastrous too-big-to-fail approach into federal law.""

With the Republicans now in control of the House, some lawmakers are already pushing to repeal Dodd-Frank. Not long after being sworn in, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said she was introducing a bill to do just that. ""I'm pleased to offer a full repeal of the job-killing Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill,"" Bachmann said.

As part of our look at the range of bills that have been attacked as ""job-killing,"" we thought we'd look at whether the charge is accurate when leveled against the Dodd-Frank bill.

We began by asking Pence's office for details on why they believed the bill would ""kill jobs."" They replied with two position statements Pence's office had sent out during the debate.

One of Pence's statements said the bill ""would discourage lending to those on Main Street. By draining capital out of the financial system and wasting it on misguided government spending and double-digit unemployment, the albatross weighing down the economy gets even heavier.""

In an interview, Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, elaborated on what Pence meant. ""Micro-level access to credit for consumers and small businesses will be severely constricted, hampering basic purchases and small-business creation,"" Thallam said. ""Individuals who need access to credit will inevitably substitute to whatever form is available (check bouncing, loan sharks, other high interest methods) which is like adding a tax on these transactions, which in turn will reduce the number of productive purchases, investments, and allocations.""

The other concern Pence raised is that ""government bureaucrats would have the authority to break up"" a bank or bank holding company that is becoming ""too big to fail"" -- ""even if the firm is financially healthy and well managed. Such arbitrary power could have a devastating impact on the nation’s economy and destroy American jobs.""

Next, we looked at the cost estimate of the bill published by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that referees fiscal and economic impacts for Congress.

Though CBO acknowledged that uncertainty about the course of future regulations clouded its estimate, it nonetheless concluded that the cost of the bill on the private sector would be substantial.

Over the bill's first five years, firms would likely have to pay $1 billion into a mandatory fund that would help liquidate failed financial institutions; $650 million in user fees to the Securities and Exchange Commission; $375 million to cover new regulatory entities within the Treasury Department; and $375 million to cover new regulatory costs for the Federal Reserve.

In addition, the bill would impose specific costs or restrictions on credit rating agencies, credit card companies and hedge funds. Finally, the bill opened the door to the SEC barring mandatory arbitration to settle disputes, requiring companies instead to use the court system. The cost of such a rule ""could be significant,"" the CBO said.

Granted, the financial and insurance sector is big -- it contributes more than $1 trillion annually to GDP, or better than 8 percent of the national GDP, so these costs would be absorbed into a pretty large base. Still, they are not trivial. While the CBO didn't go as far as to project job losses, most analysts we spoke to agreed that they could have a direct impact on the number of people employed by financial companies. In 2009, the financial and insurance sectors employed about 6.8 million Americans.

But the analysis of job losses quickly gets tricky. Between 2008 and 2009, the financial and insurance industry shed about 450,000 jobs, or 6 percent of its workforce -- most, presumably, due to the economic crisis and the resulting meltdown that the Dodd-Frank bill is designed to prevent. Should the number of jobs ""killed"" because of Dodd-Frank be offset by the 450,000 jobs in the financial sector that might have been saved had Dodd Frank been in place earlier? For that matter, what about the 7.2 million jobs lost in the larger economy between the peak employment of December 2007 and today, a drop that was caused to a significant (though not exclusive) degree by excesses in the financial sector?

Most of the experts we spoke to said the bill is all about tradeoffs -- and determining whether the tradeoff is merited depends heavily on how much confidence you have that Dodd-Frank will actually be able to prevent economic crises.

""Let's assume this bill is a big job-killer because of the direct and indirect costs to the financial system, and because of the degradation in the ability of the financial sector to support the non-financial sector,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Those costs are like a great, macro-insurance premium we all pay hopefully to avoid a costly financial crisis. The big question is then, will the financial regulatory bill reduce the likelihood or the magnitude of a future financial crisis?""

Foster said he personally doesn't think Dodd-Frank would do much good in preventing the next crisis. Others, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision -- an international panel of high-level banking officials that serves as a forum to discuss regulatory issues -- have projected that Dodd-Frank has a decent shot at succeeding.

Even supporters of the bill acknowledge uncertainty, and even skepticism, about its effectiveness. Still, many did tell us that the risks of another crisis are so serious -- including on the narrow question of how many jobs are ""killed"" as a result of future financial crises -- that even an imperfect bill needed to be passed.

""It requires an exceptional degree of chutzpah to suggest that new regulation of the financial sector represents 'job-killing' legislation,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. ""If any private industry in the United States can be legitimately identified as a 'job-killing' machine, the financial sector would seem be that industry. The nation is still trying to pick of the pieces from a devastating economic crisis brought about by the financial industry’s hubris and recklessness."" As we concluded our research on this item, we noticed that the information on how financial reform will affect the labor supply is speculative. While the CBO noted that the cost for the private sector would be substantial, it didn't estimate how much that would affect job numbers. (By contrast, CBO said the health care law would restrict the labor supply by .5 percent.) Most analysts agree that the financial regulations will restrict job growth by some amount, but nobody has detailed estimates on just how much.

Ultimately, even the supporters of the bill we spoke to acknowledged that some jobs will likely be lost, or never created, due to passage of Dodd-Frank. However, many of the experts we spoke to agreed that not passing the bill would put even more jobs in the greater economy at risk, not to mention countless nest-eggs, homes and other non-job-related concerns. Would potential job savings offset job costs? Unfortunately, there is no way to know. Still, Pence's comment ignores the principle that preventing financial shocks is job-saving. On balance, we rate the statement Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eb3196ca-e4dd-4009-863e-dbaa192dc592",/factchecks/2011/jan/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-dodd-frank-financial-regulation-bi/
