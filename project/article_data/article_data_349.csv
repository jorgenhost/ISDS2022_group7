Are you more likely to die from the flu than coronavirus? It’s complicated
","The 2019 coronavirus has infected more than 113,000 people in 109 countries. But Dr. Drew Pinsky wants the press to focus more on the flu. In a Feb. 3 segment on Daily Blast Live, a live daytime news and entertainment program, Pinsky, an internist and television personality, lambasted press coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. At the time, more than 17,000 people had been infected, almost all in China. ""The press is overreacting, and it makes me furious,"" he said. ""The press needs to shut up. Because you’re more likely to die of influenza right now."" Over the following month, the virus spread to 84 other countries, killing thousands of people in the process. But in a follow-up segment March 5, Pinsky doubled down on his comments. ""As I’ve been saying for the last month, what we should be talking about is flu generally,"" he said. ""There’s 16,000 dead, 280,000 hospitalized in this country from influenza. The message should be: Get your flu shot."" The Feb. 3 video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been repurposed into a meme. Since its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December, we have fact-checked a slew of social media posts and statements that aim to minimize the threat of the 2019 coronavirus. Some of them falsely claim there is a media-run conspiracy to exaggerate the threat of the virus. Is Dr. Drew, whose own show was canceled in 2016 after he speculated about Hillary Clinton’s health, right to say that the flu poses a bigger threat than the coronavirus? Yes and no. Based solely on the numbers, you’re more likely to die if you get the 2019 coronavirus than if you get the flu. (Several factors apply, such as age and health.) As of March 10, 4,012 people around the world had died after being infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The death toll in the United States is 28. A study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the virus from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 80% of the cases were mild, but the virus had a fatality rate of 2.3%. A more recent estimate from the World Health Organization puts the number at 3.4%, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals. For comparison, the fatality rate of this year’s strain of the flu is estimated to be between 0.05% and 0.1% in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 20,000 and 52,000 have died. RELATED: Why it’s hard to estimate the coronavirus death rate this early The higher death count for the flu is a result of its prevalence. As of now, the flu is more common in the United States than the coronavirus. So even though it has a lower mortality rate, it kills more people. ""The prevalence of flu is higher at this moment in time,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. ""(But) pound for pound, if you had both viruses, the one that’s more likely to make you die is the coronavirus."" We reached out to Dr. Drew for comment, but we haven’t heard back. Experts cautioned against minimizing the potential harm of COVID-19. As of March 10, there were 647 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States. Meanwhile, the CDC estimates that there were between 34 million and 49 million flu illnesses this season. ""For most people, the immediate risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low,"" the CDC says in its risk assessment. ""This virus is not currently widespread in the United States."" According to the Chinese CDC study, those most likely to die from the coronavirus were older than 60 and/or had preexisting medical conditions, like hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Men were also more likely than women to die.  Those risk factors are pretty similar to those for the flu. Both diseases also spread similarly: through respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes. RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself Researchers are still looking into how contagious the 2019 coronavirus is compared with other viruses, at what points it can be transmitted to other people and how common it really is in American communities. That uncertainty makes it hard to draw comparisons between the potential threat of COVID-19 and the current threat of the flu. ""We know a great deal more about transmission of influenza; we know a great deal about who is most likely to become gravely ill; we have drug treatment; we have a vaccine, even if imperfect,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, in an email. ""I think you can see big differences."" The ways to prevent the spread of both the 2019 coronavirus and the flu are similar: wash your hands, avoid touching your face, disinfect your home and stay away from people who are sick. ""While it may be true that ‘you're more likely to die of influenza right now,’ that is really the wrong way to look at the question,"" said Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist at the University of Vermont’s Division of Immunobiology, in an email. ""It's more important to ask, ‘What will the situation look like three months from now if we do nothing?’"" Part of the current public health response is trying to prevent COVID-19 from becoming an established, regularly occurring illness like the flu.  Dr. Drew said ""you’re more likely to die of influenza right now"" than the 2019 coronavirus. The key phrase in this claim is ""right now."" It’s true that, as of March 10, the flu poses a more immediate threat to the American public than the 2019 coronavirus. That’s because it’s currently more widespread; the CDC estimated there were as many as 49 million flu illnesses from October to February, while there have been 647 coronavirus cases in the United States. But the mortality rate of the flu is lower than that of COVID-19 — the former is estimated to be as high as 0.1%, while the latter is around 3.4% so far. That means you’re more likely to die if you get the coronavirus than if you get the flu, even though you’re less likely to contract COVID-19. Dr. Drew’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1AFFC0>],/factchecks/2020/mar/10/dr-drew-pinsky/are-you-more-likely-die-flu-coronavirus-its-compli/

When Joe Biden was asked if he would veto Medicare for All, he punted
","The topic of health care divides the Democratic presidential primary between those who call for expanding Obamacare and those who want ""Medicare for All."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, who supports the Affordable Care Act, has criticized the single-payer Medicare for All system favored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., citing costs as well as other factors. But does that mean Biden, if elected president, would resist such a bill if it were handed to him by Congress?  One user on Twitter overinterpreted Biden’s response to this scenario during a March 9 interview with Lawrence O’Donnell. The tweet was crossposted onto Facebook and shared among several Sanders-aligned groups.  ""Joe Biden just told @Lawrence that as president he would veto Medicare for All if it passed both houses and came to his desk,"" stated the post. Biden’s actual answer raised a lot of doubts about the hypothetical situation but wasn’t quite that plain. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what O’Donnell asked Biden: ""Let’s flash forward — you are president. Bernie Sanders is still active in the Senate. He manages to get Medicare for All through the Senate in some compromise version, the Elizabeth Warren version or other version. Nancy Pelosi gets a version of it through the House of Representatives. It comes to your desk. Do you veto it?"" ""I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now,"" Biden said. ""If they got that through by some miracle, there was an epiphany that occurred, and some miracle occurred that said okay, it passed, then you got to look at the costs. I want to know, how do they find the $35 trillion? What is that doing? Is it going to significantly raise taxes on the middle class, which it will. What’s going to happen?"" He went on to explain his current position against the legislation. ""Look, my opposition isn’t to the principle that you should have Medicare. Health care should be a right in America. My opposition relates to whether or not a) it’s doable, 2) what the cost is and what consequences for the rest of budget are. How are you going to find $35 trillion over the next 10 years without having profound impacts on everything from taxes for middle class and working class people as well as the impact on the rest of the budget?"" Some media outlets concluded that Biden’s statements mean he would veto Medicare for All. In context, Biden said he would veto ""anything"" that made health care less secure and certain as he dismissed the likelihood of the bill getting passed. He emphasized his questions about the cost of the current proposal. The Biden campaign had no comment. A viral tweet said, ""Joe Biden just told @Lawrence that as president he would veto Medicare for All if it passed both houses and came to his desk."" Biden’s response on MSNBC was not as definitive as the post made it seem. Biden replied that he ""would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."" He said if it passed, he would want to look at the costs and the impact on the budget and taxes for the middle class. To put it another way, Biden only had critical words when asked about Medicare for All, but he didn’t bluntly state he would veto it. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

Sanders is correct: NAFTA, China trade cost thousands of jobs in Michigan
","Having lost his early lead in the delegate count to Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has a lot riding on his appeal to blue-collar workers. Speaking days ahead of the Michigan primary on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Sanders said his opposition to major trade deals marked a sharp difference between him and Biden, the former Delaware senator and vice president. ""Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people making pennies an hour, have resulted in the loss of 160,000 jobs here in Michigan,"" Sanders said from Grand Rapids on March 8. ""I helped lead the effort, as you may recall, against these disastrous trade agreements. I worked with the unions, not with the CEOs of large corporations. On the other hand, Joe Biden strongly supported these agreements."" While he voiced some reservations at the time, Biden voted for both bills — the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and normalization of trade with China in 2000.  In this fact-check, we look at whether the two agreements cost Michigan 160,000 jobs. Teasing out the impact of trade deals can be difficult. There’s lots going on in the economy regardless of tariff agreements, including the 2008-09 financial crisis that plunged two of Detroit’s hometown auto companies into bankruptcy. But overall, studies back up Sanders’ claim. Sanders’ point hinges on trade with two countries, Mexico and China. But of the two, U.S. trade with China was much larger, and with that came a bigger impact. The studies Sanders relied on estimated Michigan’s job losses at nearly 44,000 (as of 2010) due to NAFTA, and about 112,000 due to China (as of 2018). We’ll get to those estimates in just a bit, but add them together and you get 156,000, which is essentially Sanders’ number. But first, focusing just on China, the latest research by a group of economists from four universities offers a broad picture of what took place after 2000 when the United States gave it permanent normal trade status.  The group’s study doesn’t put a number to Michigan’s losses, but it does highlight its struggles. Interestingly, the study found that the ultimate effect on jobs nationwide was neutral, neither a gain nor a loss.  But among regions of the country, the upheaval was substantial. Both the type of jobs and the location of jobs shifted. ""Chinese competition reallocated employment from manufacturing to services, and from the U.S. heartland to the coasts,"" the report said. A Midwest state like Michigan was on the losing end of the deal. This research dug down to the level of individual companies and found that large multinational companies offshored manufacturing jobs and expanded service jobs, in areas such as research and management, in the U.S. The study also found that the China effect disappeared after 2007. ""We find strong employment impacts from 2000 to 2007, but nothing since from 2008 to 2015,"" the authors wrote. Sanders is correct that both NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China exposed Michigan to competition from factories that paid their workers much less and spent less on worker safety and environmental protection.  But the manufacturing employment numbers reveal one of the challenges to drawing quick conclusions on the impact of the two trade deals. The job numbers show different paths after passage of each trade agreement. (Passage of trade bills is marked in red.)   After NAFTA, the number of manufacturing jobs rose to 888,000. After the China deal, the number fell to 638,000 (as of 2006 and before the Great Recession), a decline of 250,000 jobs. The raw numbers support the idea that the China impact was great. For NAFTA, the analysis is more complicated. Economist Susan Houseman at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said those rising manufacturing job numbers after NAFTA passed don’t tell the whole story. She said the studies Sanders used are valid. ""The country was experiencing record job growth in the 1990s, so you wouldn’t necessarily expect the number of manufacturing jobs to fall,"" Houseman said. ""Rather you might expect for them to grow more slowly."" The fraction of all jobs that were in manufacturing did fall by one percentage point between 1993 and 2000, suggesting that NAFTA did more for sectors other than manufacturing. Houseman also said that the NAFTA impacts would play out over time, as companies built new plants in Mexico, something that could not happen overnight. The analysis Sanders relied on came from economist Robert Scott at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. For NAFTA, Scott took the rising U.S.-Mexico trade deficit and teased out how that translated into job effects at the state level. Between 1993 and 2010, and accounting for the Great Recession, Scott found a loss of 43,600 jobs in Michigan.   Houseman said that is a conservative figure. ""The types of calculations in this, if anything, may understate job losses,"" she said. ""I don’t believe there is any basis for calling the Sanders claim of job losses for Michigan wrong."" The primary caveat for Scott’s estimate is that it’s for 2010, which is a decade ago. Michigan’s manufacturing sector has recovered a bit since then. However, for workers who lost their jobs during the first decade of the 2000s, the disruption was real. And even after rebounding, manufacturing remains well short of where it stood before NAFTA. Multiple studies also lend weight to Scott’s overall findings of the impact on the Midwest from trade with China. Research by economists Justin Pierce at the Federal Reserve and Peter Schott at Yale University, suggests over 1 million jobs nationwide have been lost due to trade with China. Some economists argue that productivity gains played a major role in displacing manufacturing jobs, but recent work casts doubt on how productivity has been calculated. Studies of the impact of automation find that it has been significant, but much less than competition from China. The latest studies go to great lengths to filter out the various factors that have shaped jobs in states like Michigan, and the trade deals emerge as a potent force. Sanders said that NAFTA and normalized trade with China cost Michigan 160,000 jobs. The studies he cited produced nearly that result. While precision is challenging, one economist said if anything, those studies underestimate the job loss due to trade. We found four studies that concluded that both trade agreements hurt the manufacturing sector in Midwest states like Michigan.

Fact-checking claims that Pelosi held up coronavirus aid
","On March 6, 2020, President Donald Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending package to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. The package sailed through the House and Senate with bipartisan support, but not without some partisan sniping. Some stories — like this one — are going around claiming Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delayed the bill in order to use the crisis as a political weapon against Republicans.  The claim surfaced as Republicans and Democrats were still negotiating details of the spending package, such as where the money would come from and provisions on treatment costs. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article cites a recent report by conservative website Red State. That report, based on comments made by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., says Pelosi held up the bill so that the campaign arm of House Democrats could run ads against Republicans on Super Tuesday about their lack of action regarding the virus. In a March 2 interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, McCarthy claimed Pelosi ""withheld the bill last week. You know why? So the DCCC could run ads against seven Republicans."" He repeated the statement in a press conference the following day.  It’s true that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official campaign arm of House Democrats, released ads related to the coronavirus in seven Republican districts.  But when McCarthy made the comments, he and other Republicans were participating in negotiations about the package. There is no indication that Pelosi deliberately held up the bill for the sake of the ad campaign. The DCCC announced on March 2 that the ads would run on Facebook in seven Republican congressional districts to call on their representatives to ""stand up"" to the Trump administration for an affordable coronavirus vaccine.  The ads target comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who said during a hearing that the administration ""can’t control that price because we need the private sector.""  ""The Trump administration would rather pad the pockets of drug manufacturers than provide access to an affordable coronavirus vaccine,"" the ads say. The clip ends with the Republican representative’s name, asking if they agree.  Reports indicate the bill stalled because of Democrats’ attempts to limit the cost of vaccines and other treatments that are developed in response to the outbreak.  Pelosi has been consistent about those provisions in multiple statements. In a joint statement on Feb. 27, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that any package Congress approves must be ""entirely new funding — not stolen from other accounts"" and must include provisions ensuring that:  ""The president cannot transfer these new funds to anything other than the coronavirus and fighting infectious diseases; vaccines are affordable and available to all the need it; interest-free loans are made available for small businesses impacted by the outbreak; and state and local governments are reimbursed for costs incurred while assisting the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak."" Pelosi called for the same provisions in another statement on Feb. 29, after the first coronavirus-related death was reported in the U.S. The Democrats’ requests did make it into the final bill. Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, pointed us to a response he made to McCarthy on Twitter, in which he called the accusation ""disgusting and false.""  ""[email protected], call your office. The bipartisan negotiations on the coronavirus funding supplemental are still underway. Your staff have been participating in those talks. This is a disgusting and false accusation."" .@GOPLeader, call your office. The bipartisan negotiations on the coronavirus funding supplemental are still underway. Your staff have been participating in those talks. This is a disgusting and false accusation. https://t.co/F9tvdk2XPo   ""It was a particularly outrageous statement,"" Hammill added in an email, ""because McCarthy’s own staff was participating in ongoing negotiations that had not concluded when he said this."" We reached out to McCarthy’s office for a response but did not hear back in time of publication. The bill, which dwarfed the $2.5 billion in funding that the Trump administration initially proposed, was introduced in the House on March 4 and swiftly passed that day, 415-2. The two nays were from Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Ken Buck of Colorado. It passed the Senate the following day, with only Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voting against it.  The funding includes more than $3 billion for research and vaccine development and $2.2 billion for prevention, preparedness and response efforts. It also allocates $1 billion for state and local response. Stories claim Pelosi held up coronavirus emergency funds so that Democrats could campaign on the issue.  During negotiations with Republicans on the funding package, Pelosi pushed for language on how the aid would be paid for and on the cost of treatments. Meanwhile, the House Democrats’ campaign arm ran ads targeting a Trump administration official’s comments about vaccine costs.  The stories make unsupported claims about Pelosi’s motives and omit the role Republicans played in the bill’s negotiations. We rate it Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280966C5BC0>],/factchecks/2020/mar/10/blog-posting/fact-checking-claims-pelosi-held-coronavirus-aid/

Post overstates Trump’s exposure to coronavirus, raising alarms

The post, shared by United Kingdom-based Daily Mail, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline exaggerates what happened and raises alarm over the possibility that Trump has been exposed to coronavirus. Based on current reporting, that’s not what we know.  A Daily Mail spokesman told us the post would be edited to make it clearer. Indeed, before we published this check, they changed it to read, ""The chairman of the American Conservative Union has revealed that he interacted with a 55-year-old man infected with coronavirus before shaking hands with Donald Trump."" Let’s take a look. The Daily Mail post includes a looping video clip of Trump on stage at CPAC and shaking hands with a white-haired man before taking the lectern for his speech.  Trump spoke on the final day of that conference, which was sponsored by the American Conservative Union and held in National Harbor, Md., Feb. 26-29, 2020. The words that appear as the Daily Mail video plays state that the man, identified as the CPAC chairman, said he had ""interacted with an infected man recovering in New Jersey"" before greeting Trump. On March 7, 2020, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced that someone who’d traveled to the state Feb. 27-March 1 for the conference was confirmed to have COVID-19. ""Those who attended or worked at the conference may be at some risk for acquiring COVID-19,"" Hogan’s statement read. The next day, March 8, 2020, the Washington Post reported the following: The man Trump shook hands with is Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and CPAC.  Schlapp said he briefly interacted personally early in the four-day conference with a man infected with the coronavirus. The man has not been identified. Schlapp said he used hand sanitizer regularly during the conference and had not had any symptoms before or after shaking hands with Trump. He said he has been in touch with his own doctor and with the infected patient, who is being quarantined in New Jersey. The White House has maintained that Trump was never in direct contact with the infected person and does not have any symptoms. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., said in a statement on March 8, 2020, that he ""briefly interacted"" with the infected person while at CPAC and would self-quarantine at his Texas home ""out of an abundance of caution."" Rep. Paul A. Gosar, R-Ariz., tweeted that same day that he and three of his staff members are under self-quarantine ""after sustained contact at CPAC"" with the person who has the virus. Schlapp told the New York Times he had had incidental contact with the infected person. The Times reported March 9, 2020, that the man, a 55-year-old New Jersey resident, was in stable condition in a hospital. As for the spread of coronavirus, we’ve reported that: Older people and those with preexisting health conditions are more at risk of developing complications from the coronavirus. For the American public, the immediate risk of coronavirus remains relatively low. The best ways to prevent the spread of the virus are to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, cover your sneezes and coughs, and disinfect your home. A headline on a Daily Mail video shared on Facebook claimed Trump has come into contact with a ""potential coronavirus sufferer."" Trump shook hands with Matt Schlapp, a man who says he had been in contact days earlier with someone who is reportedly being treated for the virus. Schlapp says he has had no symptoms of the illness. Some may argue third-hand contact indicates possible exposure for Trump, but such a conclusion ignores available evidence. While the Daily Mail did qualify its assertion by using the word ""potential"" in ""potential coronavirus sufferer,"" the headline (which ended in an exclamation point) nevertheless led readers to believe that Trump’s exposure is worthy of alarm. Indeed, anyone in a population could be a ""potential"" coronavirus sufferer.  Based on what is verifiable, we rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A43CCC0>],/factchecks/2020/mar/10/facebook-posts/headline-ignores-evidence-overstating-trumps-expos/

Coronavirus was not a US invention

But the seven-minute video, which had more than 81,000 views as of March 9, 2020, provides no evidence to back up the headline. Instead, it shows footage from an unrelated press conference. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video shows footage of U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling at an actual Jan. 28, 2020, news conference describing cases of ""Chinese economic espionage and research thefts in the United States."" But the video has been edited to include a jazz track and captions that were not a part of the original media event. During the press conference, Lelling announced the arrest of  Harvard University professor Charles Lieber for allegedly lying about his participation in a Chinese program to recruit foreign talent to China.  The Justice Department charged Lieber and two Chinese nationals in connection with aiding the Chinese government. Lieber allegedly lied about his contact with the Chinese program known as the Thousand Talents Plan, which the U.S. has previously flagged as a serious intelligence concern, and about a lucrative contract he signed with China's Wuhan University of Technology. How does this relate to the current coronavirus outbreak? It doesn’t. While Novel coronavirus 2019, or COVID-19, was first detected in China’s Wuhan Province, there is no connection between coronavirus and the investigation into Lieber’s activities involving Wuhan University of Technology: There is no mention of coronavirus in the news release or in news reports about the case. At one point in the YouTube video, a partial document is superimposed over the screen. It makes reference to ""United States Patent Rota et al.  — Coronavirus isolate from humans"" and what appears to be a list of inventors, beginning with Paul A. Rota, of Decatur, Ga. That document is the patent awarded in 2007 to Rota and others for ""a newly isolated human coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)."" It was a patent for genetic sequencing and was filed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FactCheck.org explained. FactCheck.org and the fact-checking organization Snopes have both reported there is no link between Lieber and the new coronavirus. Here’s what we know about how coronavirus emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan: COVID-19 ""is a zoonotic virus"" — that is, it was spread from animals to humans — according to a report from 25 international experts, including some from China and the U.S., convened by the World Health Organization.  Bats ""appear to be the reservoir of COVID-19 virus,"" but the intermediate host or hosts — that is, how it went from bats to humans — has not been identified.  Such viruses often originate in bats, although they sometimes can jump to another species before infecting humans. Chinese researchers have found a possible link between COVID-19 and pangolins, a mammal entirely covered in scales. Early on, many of the patients in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. There is no credible evidence to back a claim that the coronavirus was invented in the U.S. ""and then planted in China."" The best available information is that the virus originated in China with an animal and then spread to humans.

Is there no policy daylight between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, as RNC says?
","The Republican National Committee didn’t waste much time after the Democratic presidential race narrowed to two main candidates to paint Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders with the same brush.  A mass email sent by the RNC on March 5 began with the subject line, ""Biden and Bernie, two sides of the same coin."" It offered about a dozen policy issues where — according to the email at least — the two Democrats had identical stances. The issues include taxes, health care, the Green New Deal, federal abortion funding, the death penalty, and guns. ""It’s official, the Democrat Party is now deciding which near octogenarian career politician will be their nominee,"" the email said. ""And those aren’t the only similarities between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. … There is no so-called ‘moderate’ option for Democrats. Just radicalism."" We decided to take a closer look at the email, issue by issue. Here’s what we found. Claim: ""Biden: The ‘the first thing I would do’ is raise middle class taxes. Bernie says he will raise taxes on anyone making over $29,000."" One of Sanders’ options for paying for his Medicare for All proposal is to add an additional 4 percentage points to existing income tax rates for those who earn more than $29,000. So while this is not a guarantee, it is one option Sanders has suggested. Biden hasn’t proposed anything like this. In fact, his tax plan would increase the top marginal rate from 37% to 39.6%, affecting those who earn more than $400,000 — not exactly a middle-class income level. Other aspects of Biden’s tax plan target provisions of special interest to higher-income individuals and corporations, such as capital gains taxes, corporate tax rates, and additional payroll taxes for high earners. *** Claim: ""Biden supports government health care for illegal immigrants. Bernie supports government health care for illegal immigrants."" When we asked the RNC about the assertion about Biden, they pointed to a June 2019 debate in which NBC’s Savannah Guthrie asked all candidates to raise their hand ""if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants."" Biden and Sanders, among others, raised their hands. However, this glosses over some nuances in their positions. Sanders would provide coverage to undocumented immigrants under his single-payer insurance plan; he has tweeted, ""If you are a human being, regardless of your immigration status, you have a right to health care.""  Biden would not go quite that far. Under Biden’s proposal, undocumented immigrants would be able to buy insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — from which they are currently barred — but would not be able to receive federal subsidies that make these plans affordable.  If undocumented immigrants bought plans without subsidies, they wouldn’t be receiving government health care, as the email claims — they would be signing up for private insurance plans in the marketplace. *** Claim: ""Biden supports a government takeover of health care. Not only does Biden’s plan not allow Americans to keep their private health insurance, it guarantees ‘massive disruptions to private coverage.’ Bernie supports a government takeover of health care. Bernie’s health care agenda eliminates private health insurance."" Sanders would create a single-payer system in which the government acts as the health insurer for everyone, effectively supplanting most private insurance. This plan would ""provide everyone in America with comprehensive health care coverage, free at the point of service,"" Sanders’ campaign website says.  Biden offers a more modest alternative, in which individuals could voluntarily buy in to the federal Medicare program for their insurance. Under Biden’s proposal, private insurance would remain part of the health insurance market. ""Instead of starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance, he has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate,"" Biden’s campaign website says. *** Claim: ""Biden supports free college. Bernie supports free college."" This is substantially misleading. Sanders would ""guarantee tuition and debt-free public colleges, universities,"" trade schools, and historically black colleges. Biden’s proposals apply only to community colleges. Biden would provide ""two years of community college or other high-quality training program without debt for any hard-working individual."" Claim: ""Biden supports reparations. Bernie supports reparations."" Biden and Sanders have both said they support an official process to study the question of whether the descendants of slaves should receive reparations, but it’s too strong a statement to say they support the idea. As recently as 2019, Sanders was dismissive of reparations, but he later announced his support for a bill that would establish a commission to study the issue. Biden, meanwhile, told the Washington Post that his administration would ""study how reparations may be part of"" efforts to curb racism ""and ensure the voices of descendants are central when gathering data and information."" The Biden campaign also told Vice that he thinks the U.S. should ""gather the data necessary to have an informed conversation about reparations."" *** Claim: ""Biden promised to end illegal immigration detention ‘across the board,’ and to not deport illegal immigrants who have committed felony-like offenses in other countries. Bernie backs a moratorium on all deportations of illegal immigrants in U.S. and says that it is not ‘appropriate’ to deport illegal immigrants not following law in the U.S."" This is largely accurate. The email cites a comment by Biden at a Vice News event when he was asked, ""How exactly would you detain immigrants?"" He said, ""I would not retain them behind bars … They show up, and you have an ankle bracelet (and) you set a hearing. We have to surge to the border, to the areas where people are being held. Get rid of all the cages, everybody out of prisons. The most you put on is an ankle bracelet, and you give a date when you show up for an immigration hearing, and you show up."" Asked whether that was for adults and children, Biden said, ""across the board."" The email also cited a separate town hall comment by Biden in which he promised that in his first 100 days in office, deportations would only be carried out for felonies committed in the United States. Sanders, for his part, says on his website that he would ""dismantle"" deportation programs and detention centers and ""institute a moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete."" *** Claim: ""Biden supports the Green New Deal, ""radical decarbonization,"" and eliminating fossil fuels even if that means sacrificing hundreds of thousands of blue-collar jobs. Bernie supports the Green New Deal, eliminating fossil fuels, and is okay with sacrificing American jobs for his climate agenda."" Sanders is a proud supporter of the Green New Deal — he is a leading co-sponsor of the Senate version of the resolution, which is an aspirational document that sets goals for combating climate change through reductions in carbon emissions, increased energy efficiency, and expansions of clean-energy infrastructure. Biden isn’t as vocal a supporter of the legislation specifically, but he has name-checked the plan on his campaign website and echoed some of its language in his climate change policy. ""Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face,"" Biden’s campaign website says. ""It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected."" Among other things, Biden seeks to achieve a ""100% clean energy economy"" later than 2050.  The email is also correct that Biden responded affirmatively to a question in a Democratic debate that he’s OK with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of job losses in carbon-based energies as part of the transition to renewable energy. *** Claim: ""Biden supports federal funds for abortions after repealing the Hyde Amendment. Bernie supports federal funding for abortions as well as the repealing of the Hyde Amendment."" Repealing the decades-old Hyde Amendment — which bars the use of federal funds for abortions — is a goal Biden and Sanders share. Biden is a relatively recent convert to this position. After sustaining attacks from other Democratic presidential candidates, including Sanders, Biden announced in June 2019 that he would be seeking an end to the restriction. *** Claim: ""Biden supports an end to the death penalty. Bernie wants to end the death penalty."" This is another issue both candidates agree on. Biden’s campaign website says that he would ""eliminate the death penalty"" by ending it at the federal level and encourage states to do the same. Death row inmates would instead serve life sentences without parole. *** Claim: ""Biden supports a federal ‘assault weapon’ ban. Bernie supports a federal ‘assault weapon’ ban."" The two candidates agree on this as well. Biden’s website says he supports a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons. He would also seek to tighten regulation of existing assault weapons and pursue buybacks. Sanders’ proposals are essentially identical: Banning the sale and distribution of assault weapons, tightening regulations and implementing a buyback program. The Republican National Committee said in a mass email that on about a dozen issues, there is ""no daylight between"" Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. The email accurately portrays the candidates’ similarities on roughly half of the issues cited, including their positions on federal abortion funding, ending the death penalty, banning assault weapons, and the Green New Deal. However, the email is incorrect on a similar number of other issues, including taxes, health care, free college tuition, and reparations for slavery. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A340B80>],/factchecks/2020/mar/10/republican-national-committee-republican/there-no-daylight-between-joe-biden-and-bernie-san/

Reisch says low unemployment rate isn’t always good for the economy
","Since January 2018, Missouri has added more than 28,000 jobs, with its unemployment rate staying steadily below the national average. But more jobs can lead to other problems, state Rep. Cheri Toalson Reisch, R-Hallsville, said. Amidst a low employment rate, Reisch claimed small-to-medium sized retail stores in Boone County have lost their employees to larger businesses new or expanding in the county. ""In Boone County, with a 1.7 percent unemployment rate, we can’t find enough people, we can’t fill all the job openings,"" she said during a House Special Committee hearing on criminal justice reform on Feb. 1. Reisch is pushing a bill that would make it easier for stores selling liquor or lottery tickets to hire ex-felons who committed certain non-violent crimes. We delved into several government-issued data and spoke with a couple of business leaders in Boone County to see whether she made accurate points in the statement. She’s pretty close. Here’s why. Unemployment rate Reisch found the county’s 1.7% unemployment rate from homefacts.com. The website says as of September, Boone County’s unemployment rate is 1.7%. It doesn’t list a recent rate. Becky Dunn, of the Missouri Department of Higher Education & Workforce Development, confirmed the unemployment number through September. In December,the rate rose to 2.4 %, according to a department report. So, Reisch’s number was outdated. But the 2.4% rate is still notably low. The Federal Reserve calls a range of 3.5% to 4.5% to be a ""natural rate.""  Law of the jungle Casey’s General Stores and other small-to-medium sized retail stores have lost their employees to new or expanding larger businesses in Boone County, Reisch claimed. An ongoing trend of employee shortfall among small-to-medium sized businesses is due to a rising wage competition with larger businesses, said Bernie Andrews, executive vice president at the Regional Economic Development Inc. When incentivizing larger companies like Aurora Organic Dairy, the county government requires them to pay at least its average hourly wage of $18.83, or $39,196 an year, to most employees — and not many retail stores could afford paying that rate, Andrews said. This employee’s migration to large companies and shorfall for small businesses isn’t a trend just for Boone County, he said.  ""There are more jobs open than there are people to fill them"" locally and nationally, he said. An average annual salary for a retail salesperson in mid-Missouri is $27,737, according to a January report by the Department of Higher Education & Workforce Development. Here are the area job openings that month that required short-term, on-the-job training and little to no work experience: 713: retail sales  281: customer services 156: food services 142: laborers and movers 129: personal care aides We also contacted both Aurora Organic Dairy and another large employer, Veterans United Home Loan.   Sonja Tuitele, spokesperson for Aurora Organic Dairy, said her company hired 50 to 60 people for its new Columbia Milk Plant that opened in early 2019. When hiring them, she said the company gave preference to those with specific food manufacturing experience.  Chris Cline of Veterans United Home Loans told us his company hired about 1,000 new employees in 2019 for its branch in Boone County. Those employees were hired for positions ranging from customer-facing production to information technology. In the end, it’s a business law of the jungle — large businesses with better pay and benefits get employees they need whereas small businesses lose employees to the large.  Our ruling Reisch said, ""In Boone County, with a 1.7 percent unemployment rate, we can’t find enough people, we can’t fill all the job openings."" She used an outdated number that has since grown, but it’s not that much different.  The second part, verifying that Boone County retail businesses can’t find people to hire, is supported by open jobs numbers and a local expert. The big companies can pay more, leaving that quick store down the street scrambling for employees.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AD72C0>],/factchecks/2020/mar/10/cheri-toalson-reisch/reisch-says-low-unemployment-rate-isnt-always-good/

Fact Check: Did Bernie Sanders Win ‘People Of Color’ In California, And Was It ‘Not Even Close’?
","Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders often touts his ability to attract a ""multi-generational, multi-racial coalition"" of supporters, one that will ""sweep this country"" and help him win the White House.  Last week, Sanders suggested he made good on part of that promise, claiming he won ""people of color"" in the California primary ""big time.""  Sanders made that assertion at a news conference when asked about his strategy to win over African-American voters, a demographic credited with helping former Vice President Joe Biden win several Southern states on Super Tuesday.  ""Well, we’re doing better. No denying that Joe Biden has done very well with the African-American community,"" Sanders said. ""But I think if you look — and I haven’t had the time, honestly, to analyze it. But I think if you look at California, if you look at people of color in general — African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans — we won that big time. Big time. Not even close.""  Was Sanders right? Did he really score a big victory with people of color in California, including African-Americans?  We set out on a fact check.  Our Research To support the statement, Sanders’ campaign pointed to exit polls by CNN, NBC and The New York Times. They cited Sanders’ margins of victory over Biden with nonwhite voters, which ranged from 15 points in the CNN and NBC surveys to 22 points in the Times exit poll. The surveys got those numbers by asking voters which candidate they voted for and whether they are white or nonwhite.  Looking at specific categories of race and ethnicity, the polls show Sanders won Latino and Asian-American voters in California by significant margins, but lost black voters to Biden by more than 2-to-1.  The Times survey, for example, shows Sanders won the Latino vote by 34 points over Biden, gaining 55 percent of that vote to Biden’s 21 percent. Sanders won Asian-American voters by a 21-point margin over Biden and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who tied for the second largest share.  But Biden’s margin among African-American voters in California was 20 points over Sanders, 38 to 18.  The exit polls partially support what Sanders said. However, by including African-Americans in his claim about winning people of color, the senator offered a muddled message.  Also, Paul Mitchell, a Sacramento-based elections expert and vice president of Political Data Inc., cautioned that exit polls can be prone to fluctuations and that a precise picture of how California voted won’t be known for months.  The Times said its survey reflects the responses of 2,358 voters, based on interviews outside a sample of polling places or by phone. It was conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool and the results are subject to sampling error.  As of late last week, there were still 3.5 million ballots left to count in the state, according to estimates published by county election registrars.  Still, Mitchell said, it’s ""reasonable"" to say Sanders won people of color in California, given that Latinos make up the greatest share of that group. In fact, they are the largest ethnic group in the state at 39 percent, according to the U.S. Census. African-Americans, by contrast, account for 6 percent.  ""I think that he probably won Latinos by such a huge number that you could probably say people of color in general, he won. Even if he didn’t win African-Americans as a subgroup,"" Mitchell said.  A second polling expert agreed Sanders earned a strong victory with many people of color in the state.  ""There is no question that Senator Sanders was the preferred candidate of Latino and Asian voters in California,"" Matt Barreto, professor of political science and Chicana/o studies at UCLA, wrote in an email.  ""According to polls and a review of the official precinct data, research from UCLA LPPI [Latino Policy and Politics Initiative] concludes that Senator Sanders won both Latino and Asian American voters,"" added Barreto, who is the co-founder of the research and polling firm Latino Decisions. ""However it was Vice President Biden who won more votes from black voters in California."" Our Rating Bernie Sanders claimed he won ""people of color"" in the California primary ""big time,"" including African-Americans.  Exit polls show Sanders won Latinos and Asian-Americans by large margins but lost African-Americans to Joe Biden by a more than 2-to-1 margin.  While African-Americans are a smaller share of the state’s population than Latinos and Asians, it was misleading for Sanders to lump them in when talking about a ""big time"" victory among people of color.  The senator also made his claim before millions of California ballots had been counted.   We rated Sanders’ claim Half True.  HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

2019 coronavirus isn’t the common cold
","If the current coronavirus were really the same as the common cold, why would it be causing some people to die, stock markets to reel and stadiums to go empty? And yet, claims likening coronavirus to the common cold persist, including in a Facebook post that says: ""The coronavirus: The Democrats are using it to promote fear. The Chinese are using it to control protestors. And all along it’s simply the common cold."" Gesundheit, but we've been here before. The 2019 coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that includes the common cold, but the two are not the same. This Facebook post is wrong. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus disease, officially known as COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, in December, we’ve fact-checked several false claims that aim to downplay the severity of the virus and to blame the media, politicians or pharmaceutical companies for drawing attention to it.    One such claim came from conservative radio talk show host and recent Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Rush Limbaugh, who said the coronavirus is the common cold. Our rating was False.  As we reported: There are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of those viruses, which are named for their crown-like structure, can cause colds. Most strains of the coronavirus are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003. According to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a ""beta coronavirus"" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012.  All three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath — similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains ""usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory-tract illnesses, like the common cold."" But the same fact sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. ""This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,"" it said. The majority of viruses that cause the common cold are rhinoviruses, according to the CDC. Cases range from mild to moderate in severity, and many adults get two or three colds per year. Children are more likely to get them. In contrast, cases of the coronavirus have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. Older people and those with preexisting medical conditions are more likely to suffer complications from COVID-19, while children are not. The virus has an estimated 3.4% mortality rate. In short, the 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain that was unknown before December 2019. It is different and can be much more dangerous than the common cold. Despite the differences, prevention for both the 2019 coronavirus and the common cold are relatively similar: wash your hands, avoid touching your face and stay away from people who are sick.

Someone manipulated video of Joe Biden. Robin Vos shared it, then slammed media coverage
","A manipulated video that purports to show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden endorsing Donald Trump for president is making the rounds on social media. The video, created March 7, 2020, by President Donald Trump’s campaign, was shared by the president and thousands of others — including at least two prominent Wisconsin legislative leaders: Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke and Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. Vos, R-Rochester, attached this critique to his retweet: ""Omg.  We all stumble once in awhile but how can the media ignore this kind of stuff EVERY single day?"" The implication is that the video shows news the media should be covering. So let’s take a closer look at the 14-second clip. The clip in question originated at a March 7, 2020, Biden rally in Kansas City. The YouTube livestream from Biden’s official account shows the actual statement. Biden verbally stumbles several times before making a call for party unity, and a pitch for himself as the unifying candidate. Here’s what he says, with pauses noted by an ellipsis. ""We cannot get reelect… ""We cannot win this reelection… ""Excuse me — we can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here."" The Trump War Room shared a clip that cut off after the word Trump. So Biden is shown saying, ""We can only re-elect Donald Trump"" — the opposite of what was actually stated.  Starting the clip at the first stumble also eliminates the preceding context that helps explain Biden’s sentence construction. He calls himself a ""lifelong Democrat"" and a nominee ""who will bring this party together."" PolitiFact National rated the edited video Mostly False for deceptive editing via omission. And they noted Biden had referenced his point more clearly earlier that day in St. Louis:  ""If you want a nominee who will bring the party together, who will run a positive, progressive vision for the future — not turn this primary into a campaign of negative attacks because that will only re-elect Donald Trump if we go that route."" Twitter also added the label of ""manipulated media"" to a tweet of the video from Dan Scavino, Trump’s director of social media, on March 8 under a new policy. The policy applies to synthetic and manipulated media including videos, audio and images. Vos (and Steineke) left the shared video up long after it was known to be dishonestly edited. We should also note that tweeting manipulated media is not a new thing for Vos. On Feb. 25, 2020, he retweeted a post from the Wisconsin College Republicans that condemned liberal state Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky, saying, ""Don’t let (Karofsky) destroy our Constitution with her judicial activism."" The text appeared with a sloppily edited series of images implying Karofsky was tearing up the Constitution. The images superimpose Karofsky’s head on U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s body from the well-known Feb. 4, 2020, State of the Union where Pelosi tore up her copy of Trump’s speech. Vos says the media is ignoring a video showing Biden saying, ""we can only re-elect Donald Trump."" Vos implies by his statement that the video is an accurate representation of reality — and therefore worthy of media coverage. But the clip in question was cut off-mid sentence, fundamentally changing a statement that actually said Trump would only be re-elected ""if in fact (Democrats) get engaged in this circular firing squad here."" We rate Vos’s claim — like the attached video — Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A74C0>],/factchecks/2020/mar/09/robin-vos/donald-trump-manipulated-video-joe-biden-robin-vos/

Tennessee Democrats accuse Romney of saying more cops, more firemen, more teachers are not needed
","
The debate over economic policy is beginning to dominate the presidential campaign, and when presumed Republican nominee Mitt Romney visited suburban Nashville for a June 12 fundraiser, the Tennessee Democratic Party pounced on a statement it called ""shocking.""

The TNDP sent a flurry of similarly worded press releases and one read: ""Rep. Mike Turner, a career firefighter, and Principal Roxie Ross, a lifelong educator, held a press conference call at 2 p.m. responding to Mitt Romney’s claim that we don’t need ‘more firemen, more policemen, more teachers’ ahead of a Romney fundraiser in Williamson County.""

Of course, Republicans often criticize ""big government"" and sometimes portray government workers as overpaid, but it’s rare to see any politician single out a specific set of workers -- particularly firefighters and police officers. Noting that the TNDP isolated a phrase in quotes, we wondered if Romney’s words might have been taken out of context.

TNDP communications director Brandon Puttbrese responded to our inquiry with links to news articles about Romney’s comments, made just after Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker won the recall election.

Here is the full Romney quote from which the TNDP lifted the remarks. Romney is referring to President Obama’s call for more spending to boost the public sector: ""He wants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people.""

We note that Romney did not say there should be ""fewer"" policemen, firemen and teachers, but the full context of the quote makes clear he disagreed with Obama’s stated policy goal of having Congress appropriate more stimulus money to add more of them. The more accurate characterization of Romney’s remarks would have been that ""Romney disagrees with President Obama’s goal of adding ‘more firemen, more policemen, more teachers,’ "" though we recognize that doesn’t have the same zing as the TNDP’s wording.

Romney’s quote came at the same event in Iowa in which he criticized Obama for saying that ""the private sector is doing fine.""

Obama's private sector comment was part of a longer discussion in which he argued the massive public sector job losses have been a drag on an economy that has otherwise steadily added private sector jobs. Romney has pushed back, suggesting that it is an overweight public sector that is shackling the private sector.

One point worth noting here is that Walker has responded to the Obama-Romney tete a tete by defending his own record when it comes to firemen, policemen and teachers. He said recently: ""I know in my state our reforms allowed us to protect firefighters, police officers and teachers. That's not what I think of when I think of big government.""

Our check of other Romney comments found that he has typically been critical of government workers in general without specifying workers such as cops and firefighters: ""That stimulus he [President Obama] put in place — it didn’t help private sector jobs, it helped preserve government jobs. And the one place we should have shut back — or cut back — was on government jobs.""

Our ruling

The Tennessee Democratic Party says Mitt Romney has said ""we don't need 'more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.' ""

That's a slight exaggeration of Romney's remarks -- he was responding to Obama's comments on them, not outlining his own specific policy against them. Still, that's pretty close to what Romney said.

GOP leader Reince Priebus says Obama wants to raise lowest income tax rate by half
","
When Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus talked with Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren on June 5, 2012, it was primarily to discuss Gov. Scott Walker’s victory that night in the historic Wisconsin recall election.  

But Priebus, the former head of the Wisconsin Republican Party, quickly turned his sights to the November 2012 presidential election, telling the conservative TV talk show host that President Barack Obama is not a mainstream Democrat.

The example cited: Taxes.

""And you know, what does Barack Obama want to do?"" Priebus asked. ""Raise the poorest -- the lowest tax rate -- from 10 to 15 percent.""

There’s been a fierce debate in recent months about whether the wealthiest Americans should pay more in income taxes. But does Obama really want to raise the lowest income rate by half to 15 percent?

Bush-era tax cuts

When we asked Republican National Committee spokesman Ryan Mahoney for evidence to back Priebus’ claim, he said the lowest rate would rise to 15 percent if the so-called Bush-era tax cuts are allowed to expire.

So, let’s first get an understanding of those.

As we noted in rating Mostly False a U.S. Chamber of Commerce claim against U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- were enacted in 2001 and 2003 under GOP President George W. Bush. Their major provisions were to expire at the end of 2010.

In December 2010, Congress voted to extend the tax cuts through 2012 and Obama signed the measure into law.

But where does Obama stand now on extending the cuts and maintaining the lowest income tax rate at 10 percent?

Priebus’ evidence

Mahoney provided six pieces of information that he said show what Obama ""has considered doing"" in relation to the tax cuts.

1. A February 2010 Bloomberg news article quoted Obama as saying he is ""agnostic"" about raising taxes on households that earn less than $250,000 (and individuals who earn less than $200,000).

At most, that’s an indication Obama -- more than two years ago -- was open to raising taxes on non-wealthy Americans. The article doesn’t address raising the lowest tax rate to 15 percent.

2. A February 2012 book, The Escape Artists by Noam Scheiber, says Obama was ""intrigued"" -- in 2009 -- by the idea of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire.

Being ""intrigued"" by an idea three years ago doesn’t show Obama now wants to allow the tax cuts to expire in a way that would raise the lowest tax rate.

3. In July 2011, The Washington Post reported that a White House official ""argued"" Obama could block extension of the Bush tax cuts, either as a final act in office or after winning a second term.

But a staff member’s strategizing or speculation nearly a year ago doesn’t equate to what the president wants to do now in terms of the lowest tax rate.

4. The same day, Post blogger Ezra Klein pointed out the Democrats wouldn’t have to take any action in order for the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of 2012.

That’s not evidence of Obama’s intent, however. Moreover, the opinion article also says that about four-fifths of the Bush tax cuts go to households making less than $250,000 a year,"" and that the Obama administration doesn’t ""want to raise taxes on those folks.""

5. Then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden said in a National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare survey in 2007 he would ""roll back tax cuts on dividends and capital gains.""

Not only is that not a statement about Obama’s desires, it’s not even a statement about income tax rates.

6. New Yorker Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza wrote in June 2012 about federal tax and budget discussions between Republicans and Democrats, saying:

""Several White House officials I talked to made it clear that if a deal, or at least the framework for a deal, is not reached before December 31st Obama would allow all the Bush tax cuts to expire -- a tactic that would achieve huge deficit reduction, but in a particularly painful and ill-conceived fashion. The administration is preparing for that outcome, and Republicans may not be willing to budge without the threat of this cataclysm.""

Lizza wrote that Obama senior adviser David Plouffe said, ""I think we’re going to have the ability to tell the American people, ‘Hey, your taxes may go up on January 1st because these guys refuse to ask the wealthy to do anything. Hey, there are going to be cuts in spending that aren’t done as smartly as they could because these guys won’t agree to ask anything from the wealthy.’ ""

This suggests that if a fiscal compromise with the GOP can’t be reached, Obama might allow the tax cuts to expire, which would raise the lowest rate to 15 percent. But that’s not evidence that Obama, as Priebus claimed, wants to raise the rate.

Other evidence

We asked for a response from Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama’s campaign in Wisconsin. She noted that in his 2013 budget message, issued in February 2012, Obama opposed extending the Bush tax for families earning over $250,000 per year. But he supports extending the rest of the tax cuts, Morris said.

We also interviewed tax experts at two national think tanks: Alan Viard, resident scholar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute; and Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. They agreed that if the Bush tax cuts expire, the lowest income tax rate would rise to 15 percent from 10 percent.

But they also agreed that Obama has consistently backed extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone but families earning $250,000 and individuals earning $200,000. Under Obama’s proposal, Williams said, the two highest tax rates would rise to 36 percent from 33 percent and to 39.6 percent from 35 percent. But the lowest rate would remain at 10 percent.

Our rating

Priebus said Obama wants to raise ""the lowest (income) tax rate from 10 to 15 percent.""

He provided no evidence that that is the president’s position. And experts agree Obama does not support raising the lowest rate.

We rate Priebus’ statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976BCF40>],/factchecks/2012/jun/17/reince-priebus/gop-leader-reince-priebus-says-obama-wants-raise-l/

Robert Menendez claims Joe Kyrillos voted to raid pension funds by $2.8 billion
","
A theme is emerging in New Jersey’s U.S. Senate race: opponents blaming one another for bloating government debt.

Republican challenger state Sen. Joe Kyrillos has tied U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to growth in the national debt and deficits. In an interview on NJTV’s ""On the Record"" that aired June 8, Menendez, a Democrat, responded to those charges.

""Well first of all, evidently my Republican opponent has selective memory,"" Menendez said, first citing growth in state debt under Kyrillos’ watch.

Then, Menendez said: ""Here's someone who raided the state's -- voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.""

Kyrillos helped pushed through a controversial plan in 1997 from then-Gov. Christie Whitman to sell nearly $2.8 billion in bonds in a bid to cover unfunded liabilities in the state’s pension system.

To be clear, we are not ruling on whether the pension bonds were sound fiscal policy. We are also not ruling on Whitman’s overall impact on the pension system. We’re looking at two, specific claims: whether voting for the bonds constituted a $2.8 billion raid on the pension system and whether they are costing taxpayers $15 billion to pay off.

Both statements veer from the truth, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

The bond legislation -- approved on June 5, 1997, with Kyrillos voting in favor of it -- authorized the state’s Economic Development Authority to sell $2.75 billion in bonds, the proceeds of which were deposited in state retirement funds for public workers.

A separate, companion bill changed accounting rules for the pension system and allowed the state and local employers to reduce their normal contributions by the amount of surplus in the funds.

The move allowed Whitman to avoid making nearly $600 million in payments into the pension system that year, which helped balance her budget.

Melissa Castro, a spokeswoman for the Menendez campaign, said ""skipping scheduled payments into the pension system is a raid of pension funds, because by definition, it is reducing the total funds available to pay the funds' obligations.""

Whitman skipped payments that year -- as she did in others -- but she put nearly $2.8 billion of borrowed money in the funds. That does not fit the definition of a raid.

Now, what’s the final price tag for those pension bonds, which mature in 2029?

Menendez put the tab at nearly $15 billion. According to the state Treasury Department, the bonds -- which the state is paying more than 7 percent interest on -- will cost $10.1 billion to pay off. The general fund shoulders the burden of the bond payments, not the pension system.

Treasury Department spokesman Andy Pratt said it’s unfair to look at the expense of the bonds without also considering the investment interest the money is earning. The average rate of return has been 6.36 percent a year, Pratt said.

Ultimately, the state’s general fund is still on the hook for $10.1 billion. In the upcoming budget, debt service on the bonds will cost nearly $300 million.

Castro said whether it was $15 billion or $10 billion, Menendez is still correct on his fundamental point. ""Nevertheless this is still bad fiscal policy,"" she said.

Our ruling

Menendez said Kyrillos ""voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.""

Kyrillos voted in favor of borrowing $2.75 billion to put into the state’s pension funds. The move allowed Whitman to avoid nearly $600 million in pension payments that year, but overall, money went into the system, not out of it. To call it a vote to raid pension funds by $2.8 billion is inaccurate.

Also, the bonds will cost taxpayers, in total, about $10.1 billion, not $15 billion.

We rate this claim False.

Marsha Blackburn says health-care law will lead to loss of 1,000 of 10,000 medical-device industry jobs in her district
","
We’ll know later this month what the Supreme Court has done to the Affordable Care Act and which of its thousands of provisions will stand or be axed. Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is trying to nibble away at individual provisions.

Several members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., recently gathered for a photo opportunity and to speak for repealing a health-care law provision that applies to a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices and for a bill that would repeal it.

""In my congressional district, we have about 10,000 individuals that are employed in the medical device industry,"" Blackburn said. ""We have estimates from the Manhattan Institute that 1,000 of those jobs will be lost if this tax stays on the books.""

That sounded pretty drastic to us. We decided to check out the accuracy of Blackburn’s summary of the institute’s findings, and what went into the institute’s estimate.

We first went to Blackburn’s press person, Mike Reynard, who sent us a YouTube video of Blackburn’s statement; LifeScience Tennessee’s Workforce Development Survey which includes as its third federal and regulatory priority ""Medical Device Tax Repeal""; and, the Manhattan Institute’s 30-page analysis of ""The Employment Effects of the New Excise Tax on the Medical Device Industry"" by Diana and Harold Furchtgott-Roth.
  
The Manhattan Institute is a conservative, market-oriented policy think tank based in New York City. It has received funding from the usually politically neutral Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Walton family foundation, but also from very conservative Koch and Scaife family foundations.

LifeScience Tennessee is the non-profit advocacy group promoting the life science industry in the Volunteer State. Its survey uses slightly different numbers from Blackburn’s in describing the Manhattan Institute’s findings, saying it ""predicts a loss of 1,000 jobs in Tennessee, which currently employs more than 9,000 workers directly and many more indirectly.""

Since we know some of those 9,000 jobs are in Johnson City, Chattanooga and and Knoxville and other places outside Blackburn’s 7th Congressional District, we can begin to quibble with Blackburn’s suggestion that 10,000 are in her district, which stretches to connect suburban Nashville to suburban Memphis.

Figures for 2011 from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development indicate there were 236 medical device manufacturing establishments with 8,871 employees in seven Tennessee counties -- or more than 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed were in her own congressional district.

Blackburn represents people in parts of two of those counties -- Davidson and Shelby -- and those counties employ 6,044 people, a majority of the jobs in that category. We also know that in Shelby County, a large majority of those jobs have long been located in the mostly urban 9th Congressional District, not the suburban-rural 7th. Three Medtronic and three Smith & Nephew operations all have addresses within the 9th Congressional District.

Also worth noting -- because of re-districting, Blackburn will represent neither Shelby nor Davidson next year if she’s re-elected.

Reynard, her spokesman, said Blackburn didn’t mean to say ""in my congressional district,"" but rather that ""she meant ‘state.’ "" However, as of June 15, the video of the statement was still posted by the ""RepMarshaBlackburn"" channel on YouTube without any clarification, and other partisan websites were featuring it. PolitiFact policy is to rule on what is said, but to acknowledge when someone admits to a mistake and take that into account when making a ruling.

Blackburn does make the point that anything affecting medical device manufacturing could have a significant effect on Tennessee employment -- many of her suburban residents do in fact work for firms like Smith & Nephew and Medtronic -- so let’s look at exactly what the Manhattan folks said.

The study says Tennessee had 9,179 medical device manufacturing jobs statewide in 2009, nearly 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed. It then goes into a discussion from Macroeconomics 101 on the excise tax’s anticipated effect on the elasticity of demand for medical devices. It assumes that price-sensitive elasticity would send some manufacturing offshore. It breaks down the number of jobs lost by the effect of the tax on a shift in production offshore of 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, all the way up to 30 percent, where it says as many as 146,218 of the estimated 409,000 jobs nationwide might be lost.

Table 11 on page 21 of the report indicates that in Tennessee 1,023 of 9,179 jobs would be lost statewide assuming a 2.3 percent excise tax and a 10 percent shift in production offshore.

But is that shift to overseas employment a reasonable assumption?

We hear a lot of talk these days about penalizing, not rewarding, companies that use the overseas labor of low-wage countries. To the extent it’s not just talk, some politicians are seeing that some constituents thought they favored ""free trade"" until they saw that free-trade agreements may lower standards of living and manufacturing employment numbers of higher-wage countries.

It’s safe to say this debate will rage on, but what’s less clear is the extent to which health-care spending is sensitive to fluctuations in price. How will  those who need a catheter or a stent, or those who manufacture them, respond to the imposition of a 2.3 percent excise tax? If someone needs crutches, is a 2.3 percent rise in price a major consideration? A 2006 study cited by Businessweek in March indicates health-related spending is ""relatively inelastic: When prices go up, demand falls by only a fraction as much.""

The same Businessweek article notes that another study, commissioned by the medical device industry trade association AdvaMed, also assumed that American manufacturers would ship 10 percent of jobs overseas in response to the tax. But since the tax applies to all devices -- those made overseas as well as domestic production -- there would be no incentive to move production out of the country, it says, describing a Bloomberg Government analysis. Devices manufactured in the U.S. for sale overseas are exempt from the tax.

It also makes the case that the industry trade group underestimated the increased demand for medical devices from the 32 million more people who will be insured under the Affordable Care Act.

Our ruling

Blackburn exaggerates the number of medical device manufacturing jobs in her district and in the state while citing a free-market advocate’s 2009 study that says 1,000 jobs could be lost statewide.

Some of the assumptions made by The Manhattan Institute study have been questioned, and the provisions of the bill itself mean there’s little reason to suspect there would be much off-shoring based on the excise tax. There is also no consensus on how much demand might drop for medical devices produced in Tennessee based on pricing.

Taking into account that Blackburn’s office acknowledges she made a mistake in saying ""congressional district"" rather than ""state,"" we rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C625C0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/17/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-says-health-care-law-will-lead-lo/

Rep. John Edwards says decriminalizing marijuana would save $4 million to $11 million for Rhode Island
","On June 13, 2012, Governor Lincoln Chafee signed into law legislation that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana. As of April 1, 2013, having 1 ounce or less will be a civil offense, punishable by a $150 fine.

Rep. John Edwards, D-Tiverton, was the bill’s prime sponsor as it moved through the Assembly for the third consecutive year.

During a June 5 House debate, he told the story of how, as a construction manager, he employed two skilled carpenters in their 50s who were barred from working on federal projects because ""they had a stupid arrest when they were young for simple possession"" of marijuana.

Most people don’t go to prison for having a small amount of marijuana, Edwards said, ""but they do get arrested and the arrest never goes away."" Not only would his bill curtail those arrests, said Edwards, ""it will save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars and it will also allow our police to do what they do best and that’s catch criminals.""

We were curious where Edwards got his cost saving figures; $4 million to $11 million is a pretty wide window. Edwards told us he got his information from Wallace B. Gernt Jr. and Christopher Reilly, the president and vice president respectively of The Bradford Group, the Rhode Island public relations firm. One of its clients is the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C., group trying to change marijuana laws around the country.

The facts

When we contacted Reilly, he acknowledged a certain haziness hovering over the figures: ""There’s a lot of different thoughts of where those numbers come from.""

Ah, OK.

Then he sent us two reports and had the Marijuana Policy Project forward a memo that a Harvard University economist sent Rhode Island lawmakers earlier this year.

One report was from the Special Senate Commission to Study the Prohibition of Marijuana, issued in March 2010. It notes that in 2009, Rhode Island police made 2,546 arrests for marijuana possession, first offense. (It doesn’t say how much pot each suspect had.)

But the report does not say how much money Rhode Island could save by decriminalizing marijuana.  It defines the savings only as ""significant"".

The second report was ""The Criminal Justice Costs of Marijuana Prohibition in Rhode Island,"" issued in 2010 by the Rhode Island nonprofit group OpenDoors, which helps people released from prison. That report, supported by the Marijuana Policy Project, says Rhode Island stands to save a whopping $12.7 million a year by decriminalizing possession of an ounce or less of marijuana.

We contacted the main author of that report, Nick Horton, who told us that most of the purported savings -- $11.2 million -- wasn’t calculated by OpenDoors at all. ""That figure is not mine,"" said Horton.

It turns out that number came from Jeffrey Miron, the Harvard economist, and his 2010 report that studied how much money the United States would save if it legalized all drugs.

In his one-page memo to Rhode Island lawmakers this spring, Miron provided the general equation he used to reach his $11.2 million figure but never plugged in any actual numbers:  ""I guess when you are a Harvard professor, you no longer have to ""show your work,’’ Robert Capecchi, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, wrote in an email when Politifact asked for the details.

When we called Miron, he said his estimate -- which related exclusively to police enforcement savings -- came from a 2010 report he did for the libertarian Cato Institute: The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition. The study found that by legalizing all drugs, the United States could save $41.3 billion a year.

The study includes a state by state analysis of drug arrests that Miron used. For instance, 2007 data from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Reports shows that in Rhode Island that year the police made 26,966 drug arrests. Of those, 1,922 were for marijuana possession. (Again, the data don’t say how much marijuana each suspect had.)

By dividing 1,922 by 26,966, Miron determined that 7 percent of all arrests that year were for marijuana possession.

He then used other data from state government and the U.S. census -- some coming from 2008 -- to conclude that the total police expenditure in Rhode Island was $287 million. Seven percent of that is $20.1 million.

Then he estimated that half of the marijuana arrests were incidental to other more serious charges. Kicking those out, he calculated the annual police savings would be $10.5 million.

That’s not the $11.2 million cited by OpenDoors, but Miron says the $700,000 difference is likely because the data he used was several years old.

In a follow-up conversation, Edwards conceded that he never thought the savings would total the $11 million he cited on the House floor. ""It’s more on the lower end of $4 million,"" he said.

He based that, in part, on some of his own calculations of prison savings -- a point that Miron, the Harvard economist, said he was surprised to hear Edwards talking about because ""almost no one is in prison for [minor] possession.""

But Edwards says he asked Corrections officials for a one-day snapshot of the prison population about a year or so ago. On that day, 42 people were being held for marijuana possession. He multiplied that by the average cost of holding one person at the ACI for a year ($44,000) and came up with a quick $1.8 million savings.

Corrections Department officials told us Edwards’ methodology is wrong because those inmates are scattered among many different units, so their absence would not lead to any staff reductions. They did say there would be some savings by having those 42 beds empty -- about $154,602.

That’s a long way from $1.8 million, let alone $4 million to $11 million.

Our ruling

State Rep. John Edwards was specific in his claim that decriminalizing marijuana will ""save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars.""

Edwards later backed away from the $11 million figure.

Yet neither he nor any of the advocates he worked with to get the legislation passed could substantiate even the lesser amount.

Therefore we rate his statement a smoldering False.

"['New Hampshire', 'Jobs', ""William O'Brien""]","
NH Speaker of the House Bill O'Brien gives GOP credit for state job growth
","
Unlike the national job picture, the New Hampshire employment report brought good news to the Granite State this week, and William O’Brien, Speaker of the N.H. House of Representatives, was quick to give credit where he saw credit to be due -- to himself and the Republican majority at the statehouse.

""The latest evidence of Republican success is that since the beginning of the current legislative term, state unemployment has gone down almost 20% to 5% adjusted,"" O’Brien, a Mont Vernon Republican,  wrote in a June 14 letter to The Telegraph. ""This is certainly an inconvenient truth for those that pine for the ‘good old days’ of over-spending.""

O’Brien’s letter also accused The Telegraph of taking facts out of context, or twisting them to discredit ""the low-spending and job-creating agenda of the current Republican majority."" In conclusion, he offered statistical evidence of the Republicans’ success. We took the bait and decided to crunch the numbers.

Throughout the recession, New Hampshire’s unemployment rate has stayed far below the national average, and while analysts have expressed disappointment over recent national job counts, the state figure has remained stable, at or below 5.3 percent for the sixth straight month.

The state numbers weren’t hard to find. The New Hampshire Employment Security office tracks the state’s unemployment figures back to 1976 .

As a baseline for the claim, O’Brien’s staff pointed to November 2010, when they were first elected to office. At that time, 42,710 state residents were considered unemployed, setting the state’s adjusted unemployment rate at 5.8 percent, according to state estimates. By January 2011, when the new Legislature first convened, the total number of unemployed residents fell to 41,200, or 5.6 percent. And, by May 2012, the most recent figures available, that number had fallen to 36,740, or 5 percent even.

Doing the math, these figures fall short of the ""almost 20 percent"" drop that O’Brien cites. The .8 percent loss from November 2010 to May 2012 amounts to a 13.8 percent slide, and the .6 percent drop from January 2011 equals 10.7 percent.

And then there is the question of credit.

In his statement, O’Brien attributed the drop in unemployment to the Republican legislature, and in a follow-up email, he credited GOP efforts to reduce taxes, fees and surcharges on businesses and to limit regulations, among other actions.

""The New Hampshire House of Representatives received a mandate from the voters of this state to cut state spending; reduce taxes and fees; return fiscal sanity to the state; and promote economic development to create jobs,"" O’Brien wrote in a statement.

And they may have done all those things, but economists say none of them would have had such an immediate impact on the state’s economy or the unemployment rate.

Economists consistently downplay state government’s role in reducing the unemployment rate, which is typically dictated more by national economic trends than by state policies, they said.

""(State government) definitely has an effect, but at the end of the day, it’s pretty small,"" said James Feyrer, an associate professor of economics at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. ""It really has to do with what's happening with the national economy, the international economy.""

Across the country, the recession had already bottomed out and the economy had started adding jobs by the November 2010 elections. That fall, the nation’s economy grew by 220,000 jobs in October alone and another 121,000 in November, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In New Hampshire, employers started adding jobs around that same time, increasing the job count by 1,200 between September and December before the Republicans took office, according to the state employment security office.

""It was starting to get a bit better then,"" said Annette Nielsen, a state economist. ""That was the start of it.""

Over the months to come, the policies enacted by House Republicans may have improved the state’s economic climate. In general, the state government can improve the business climate by changing a state’s tax structure and regulatory laws, among other factors, economists said.

But, these changes generally don’t have immediate effects. Instead, they tend to help the economy over time rather than paying immediate dividends, said Feyrer, of Dartmouth College.

""Most of the things the state does to encourage growth end up being longer-term things,"" he said.

Further, despite their best efforts, states’ ability to improve the employment figures tends to be limited under an economic recession, when employers aren’t hiring or re-locating often, added Dennis Delay, an economist with the N.H. Center for Public Policy Studies.

""In a recession, (state government) becomes muted in a way in that your first concern is how you're going to survive as a business person,"" Delay said. ""All of these other things are secondary to that.""

Our ruling:

PolitiFact examines these claims in two parts. Are the numbers right? And how much credit do experts say the group deserves?

The numbers are off considerably. New Hampshire’s unemployment rate has dropped about 14 percent since the 2010 elections and 10.7 percent since the new Legislature took office in January 2011 -- well short of the 20 percent he claimed.

Also, economists say it's a stretch for the Republicans to take credit for the unemployment number, which is usually the result of larger forces. State policies typically take more time to have an effect.

On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096973AC0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/15/william-obrien/nh-speaker-house-bill-obrien-gives-gop-credit-stat/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Ron Paul touts nearly 200 delegates bound to his candidacy at Republican National Convention
","
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul proclaims ""great news"" in a message to supporters posted online June 6, 2012.

The Texas presidential candidate says: ""Due to the smart planning of our campaign and the hard work and diligence of supporters like you, we stand to send nearly 200 bound delegates to the Republican National Convention in Tampa. This number shatters the predictions of the pundits and talking heads and shows the seriousness of our movement.""

Paul’s message continues: ""What’s more, we will send several hundred additional supporters to Tampa who, while bound to"" presumptive nominee Mitt ""Romney, believe in our ideas of liberty, constitutional government, and a common-sense foreign policy. When it is all said and done, we will likely have as many as 500 supporters as delegates on the convention floor. That is just over 20 percent!""

We don’t know how anyone could pin the number of philosophical supporters Paul will have at the convention in late August. Setting that aside, is it correct, as Paul says, that his campaign stands to send nearly 200 ""bound delegates"" to Tampa?

Agreed, one could view Paul’s declaration as a prediction that’s not factually checkable. We see it, though, as a done-did-it boast; note his present-tense crow that the total ""shatters the predictions"" of others.

Let’s look at whether evidence backs up his message.

Paul’s campaign did not reply to our requests for elaboration. So, unfortunately, we do not know how he gets to his ""nearly 200"" count.

An independent monitor of delegates won by each candidate, the Associated Press news organization, pegs Paul’s current delegate count at 137. It puts Romney at 1,480 of the party’s 2,286 delegates. Other former candidates and delegate counts, as tabulated by the AP: Rick Santorum (267); Newt Gingrich (138); Jon Huntsman (2).

On a web page showing the count, the AP says Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, ""became the Republican party's presidential nominee by crossing the threshold of 1,144 delegates to the GOP national convention. ... Most delegates are awarded through state primaries and caucuses. Other delegates, mostly members of the Republican National Committee, are free to endorse any candidate they choose at any time, even before a primary. The Associated Press includes such delegates in its tally once they declare a candidate preference.""

According to the AP, Paul’s delegates were accumulated in 21 states, starting with one delegate in Iowa’s Jan. 3, 2012, caucuses and three in the subsequent New Hampshire primary. Paul drew the majority of delegates resulting from February caucuses in Minnesota and Maine, drawing 30 and 21 delegates, respectively. He won 18 delegates in the Texas primary in May.

Notably, too, some delegates remain to be chosen. For instance, Utah, where Romney has long ties, will determine 40 delegates via its June 26 primary.

For deeper perspective, we asked the reporter who oversees the AP count, Stephen Ohlemacher, if Paul stands to have nearly 200 bound delegates at the convention.

Ohlemacher said that’s theoretically possible.

When we visited by phone on June 13, 2012, Ohlemacher said the AP had either not determined — or voters and activists had yet to decide — how about 230 delegates break out between Romney and Paul, counting 46 members of the Republican National Committee yet to say who they support. RNC members are automatic delegates and may support any candidate they choose.

Ohlemacher elaborated in a follow-up email: ""Delegates are bound -- or unbound -- based on state party rules. For delegates who are bound by the outcome of primaries, I simply do the calculations on election night and verify them later with the state party. State parties sometimes wait for the certified election results, which can take a month or longer in some states.

""For unbound delegates, the AP asks them whom they support. If they say they support a candidate, we count the delegate in that candidate’s total. But we don’t bind them. In fact, when the nomination was still in doubt, we re-interviewed many RNC delegates several times to see if they had changed their minds.""

In five of six states with caucuses -- Iowa, Colorado, Minnesota, Maine and Washington -- the AP reached delegate counts by assuming each candidate would capture the share of delegates commensurate with how they fared on caucus day, even though actual mix of delegates would be determined later, Ohlemacher said.

Still to settle out, he said, are Utah’s winner-take-all primary and delegate-selection decisions at state conventions in Iowa, where the party chair supports Paul and 26 delegates are to be awarded; Montana, with 23 delegates at issue; and Nebraska, with 32 delegates at stake.

Looking back, Ohlemacher said that in Pennsylvania, 59 delegates were elected directly on the ballot, with no indication whom they supported for president. The AP reached 31 of them, he said, with 28 yet to respond, making their candidate choices unknown. Also, he said, the Pennsylvania party has yet to pick 10 additional delegates.

On another front, Louisiana’s recent state convention ended with 23 delegates not assigned to candidates, he said. Five were to be ""uncommitted,"" he said, based on the state’s GOP primary results. Also, he said, the AP has not determined the alignment of 12 delegates picked at the Illinois state convention or 16 delegates chosen at Indiana’s convention.

Phew.

It could be, we suppose, that Paul picks up enough yet-to-be determined delegates to have nearly 200 delegates at the convention. However, it also seems unlikely Paul could have known as much for a certainty when he sent his message.

Separately, we contacted Romney’s campaign about delegate counts and didn’t hear back. We also nudged Ted Kwong, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, who deferred to the AP’s count. ""We don’t have an official, up-to-date delegate count,"" Kwong said by phone.

Our ruling

If enough yet-to-be-chosen or yet-to-declare delegates go Paul’s way, he could land nearly 200 delegates. 
However, we rate claims based on what’s known when the claims are made. Paul had 137 delegates when he wrote supporters about shattering predictions.

Does administration account for 4 percent of Portland Public Schools staff?

","
Portland Public Schools, like most of Oregon’s school districts, is struggling to keep class sizes down and school years full even as budget conditions force reductions.

In a recent opinion piece printed in The Oregonian, one parent advocate suggested the district try harder to consolidate schools before asking voters to approve a bond. ""Cut bureaucracy,"" wrote Lainie Block Wilker. ""Media reports confirm PPS' top-heavy bureaucracy. KPMG's audit recommended reducing management layers.""

This didn’t sit so well with some school board members, who promptly responded with their own opinion piece, also printed by The Oregonian. (Five others also signed onto this commentary.)

""Wilker claims that PPS administration is ""top-heavy,"" wrote members Ruth Adkins and Trudy Sargent. ""The 14-year-old KPMG audit she cites actually commended the district for ‘maintaining a lean administrative staff that accounts for 8 percent of PPS' total staff.’ Since then, central administration has been reduced by one-half and is now less than 4 percent of PPS's staff. Next year's budget further reduces central staff by 10 percent. Central administrative costs are not a reason to oppose the bond.""

As reporters, we’re always a little suspicious when it comes to bureaucratic management, so we decided to check out the claim that central administration is ""less than 4 percent of PPS’s staff.""

First, we went back to the audit that got flagged in both commentaries. The ""Comprehensive Performance Audit of the Portland Public Schools"" was published Sept. 3, 1998, by auditing firm KPMG. The audit points out several shortcomings of the district -- but the size of the administration is certainly not one.

In one section, as the two board members point out, the audit commends the district for ""maintaining a lean administrative staff that accounts for 8% of PPS’ total staff."" That’s not to say the audit didn’t find some places for further reductions. Auditors identified various areas where management could be shaved, but time and time again it confirms that the number of management layers and the ratio of managers to non-managers met industry ""best practices.""

The auditors, unfortunately, did not clarify what they meant by ""administrative staff."" We called the auditing firm, but they weren’t able to track down anybody familiar enough with the 14-year-old audit to give us definitions.

Our next stop was Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby, who outlined the staff breakdown for this year and next. The Oregon Department of Education asks school districts to classify spending under four specific categories: direct classroom, classroom support, building support and central support.

Currently, there are about 152 full-time-equivalent positions in central support at Portland Public Schools. This category, according to the state’s definition, includes ""executive administration, business and fiscal services, personnel services, retirement incentives, and public information."" That means it covers the superintendent’s office, as well as the legal, finance, insurance and human relation divisions -- among others.

All told, there are some 4,048 budgeted FTE positions, which means that the board members were right -- central support makes up just under 4 percent of the total PPS staffing.

That said, even though it’s a rigidly managed state definition, central support doesn’t cover all the positions that your average Oregonian might call ""administrative."" Building support, for example, which has 596 budget positions, includes IT, security, utilities, purchasing, warehouse and others. Direct classroom and classroom support make up the majority of staffing, more than 80 percent, including teachers, curriculum services, social work services, athletics and others.

All this is to say, yes, ""central support"" -- which is the word the school board members used in their commentary -- is less than 4 percent of the PPS staff. But that definition covers a very specific sort of employee and not necessarily every employee that somebody on the outside might consider ""administrative.""

Now, for that last bit. Is central support really getting cut by 10 percent next year? At first blush, no. There are 152 positions budgeted this year and 146 budgeted for the next. That’s a 4 percent decline. We checked in with Robb Cowie, the district’s chief spokesman, who pointed out that central support is really losing 15 positions when you consider that eight translation service positions are moving from other areas to central support. If you ignore that transfer, the board members are right about the 10 percent reduction.

Is Portland Public Schools ""top-heavy"" as one parent advocate described it? That’s really not for us to say. What we can say, however, is that central support -- as the state defines it -- accounts for 4 percent of the budgeted positions at Portland Public Schools. We can also say that central support will see a 10 percent reduction in its current FTE positions next year. Technically, then, the board members are right on all counts. However, there’s some important context in the fact that central support is a bureaucratic term that doesn’t necessarily reflect the full scope of administrative employees working for Portland Public Schools.

We rate this claim Mostly True -- it’s accurate, but it requires some clarification.",[<zip object at 0x000002809671F040>],/factchecks/2012/jun/15/portland-public-schools/portland-public-schools-administration-top-heavy/

Tim Kaine says Virginia women earn 79 cents to every $1 made by men
","
Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine fired off a fundraising email June 6 lamenting the defeat of the Paycheck Fairness Act the day before.

The legislation would have barred companies from retaliating against employees who inquire about pay discrimination and opened avenues for female workers to sue for punitive damages in cases of pay bias.

Kaine’s email called the bill’s failure ""the latest example of women’s rights legislation being targeted by Republicans in the Senate.""

Kaine’s wrote, ""With a few more votes, we would have made an important step forward in helping narrow the gap between what women currently earn -- here in Virginia, only 79 cents to each dollar earned by men -- and the equal pay that they deserve,"" the email said.

Do working women in Virginia really earn only 79 percent of the pay of men? We checked.

Gender pay data

Kaine’s statement was based on two reports, according to Lily Adams, a campaign spokeswoman.

Both the National Women’s Law Center and the National Partnership for Women and Families, supporters of the Fairness Act, created fact sheets on wage disparity in each state.

The organizations relied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages in its Current Population Survey.  In 2010, the statistics and showed women made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country. President Barack Obama and other Democrats used the  figure to urge passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act.

The Census Bureau also reports state figures in its American Community Survey. They show in Virginia, women earned 79 cents for every dollar men made in 2010.

But the annual wage comparisons does not take into consideration those who work less than full-time and less than year-round.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at weekly wages instead of annual pay. The national median pay for women was $669 a week in 2010, or 81 percent of men’s median weekly pay of $824. The weekly wage data does not include the pay of self-employed people. But it does factor those who do not work year-round, such as teachers, some construction workers and seasonal workers. And, as with the annual figures, men tend to work more hours.

In Virginia, BLS figures show women in 2010 earned a median $719 a week, or 75.2 percent of men’s median weekly pay of $956. So while using weekly figures narrows the gender wage gap nationally, it broadens the disparity in Virginia.  

The national gender gap shrinks for workers paid hourly rates. Women are paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men, according to the BLS data for 2010. This data includes those who work part-time, a status women seek more than men, according to a Pew Research Center survey. In 2010, 27 percent of women worked part-time compared to 13 percent of men did in 2010.

State-specific data is not available for hourly wages.

Which numbers are the best?

Experts disagree on the best way to measure pay disparity and why women make less than men.

""Hourly wage ratios are better than annual or weekly but none of them get to the important reasons for wage differentials,"" said June O’Neill, director of the Center for the Study of Business and Government at Baruch College at the City University of New York.

She added, ""The underlying reason for the various differentials have been spelled out by me and other economists -- namely that women's greater ties to child care limit their choices of occupations and type of work.""

O’Neill’s research shows that single, childless women make about the same as single, childless men in the same education in the same occupations.

An 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh also concluded that the wage gap is not simply a product of sexism. CONSAD found that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other trends common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; they tend have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; they tend to have a shorter work history and take more time off from work for childbirth and child care.

CONSAD said these factors, when considered, reduce the pay gap to between 4 to 7 percent, which could be result of discrimination.

""As a result, it is not possible now, and doubtless will never be possible, to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men different on socially acceptable bases, and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women,"" the report said.

But where CONSAD concluded that adjusting for variables reduces the likelihood of discrimination, others disagree.

Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research in Washington, said bias is not limited to the walls of the workplace. She said society expects women to work fewer hours than men so they can care for children.

""The focus on saying, ‘Is it direct discrimination?’ neglects that only part of this is direct discrimination,"" she said in an interview. ""Really the rest is that women are more likely to take time out when they have children, but the question is whether you think that’s right when men and women have children but women are taking time off?""

She said the data that shows a 21-cent gap in Virginia has been used the longest and ""provides the best reference for change over time."" And the full-time, year-round employees the annual data includes are the ""most committed"" to work.

""Whichever way you measure a wage gap, a wage gap remains,"" Hegewisch said.

Our ruling

Tim Kaine said women earn 79 cents to each dollar that men earn in Virginia.

Of the two databases that measure pay for men and women in each state, Kaine used the one with the smaller earning gap in Virginia and described its finding accurately.

But gender pay is a complicated subject and there are many reasons -- in addition to discrimination -- why a gap exists: women tend to work fewer hours than men; they tend to choose lower paying professions than men; they tend to take more time off than men to tend to children.

Kaine’s statement lacks this context. It creates an impression that men are being paid much more than women when their qualifications, occupations and work hours are the same. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B01080>],/factchecks/2012/jun/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-virginia-women-earn-79-cents-every-/
"['Georgia', 'Congress', 'Voting Record', 'Stephen Simpson']","
Ga. congressman's record skimpy, opponent says
","
One of the many criticisms of this Congress is it’s not getting anything done.

A candidate hoping to replace one congressman from Georgia is using that argument in an attempt to unseat the incumbent.

The contender, Stephen Simpson, said U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, R-Athens, has not authored any legislation that has been adopted by Congress, according to an article in The Walton Tribune.

""Nothing he has introduced has ever passed,"" Simpson, who will face off with Broun in the Republican Party primary on July 31, told PolitiFact Georgia. ""That’s a statement of fact.""

Not true, Broun’s office said. 

PolitiFact Georgia wondered who was correct here?

Broun has successfully added several amendments to bills that his office says could have been done as separate legislation. The congressman’s representatives also say those amendments have an impact. Simpson said amendments are added to bills in Congress like sugar in coffee. Broun’s amendments, Simpson said, aren’t that impressive.

Broun was first elected to the House of Representatives in July 2007 in a special election after the death of Charlie Norwood. He has served three terms.

Simpson’s campaign website describes the challenger as a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who says he will be ""a patriot, not a politician.""

""I think the message [Simpson is] trying to get across is Broun is ineffective,"" longtime University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said.

The congressman has a near-perfect lifetime score of 99.2 on his voting record, as determined by the American Conservative Union, whose board consists of former GOP members of the George W. Bush administration and former Republican members of Congress. Broun’s score was higher than U.S. House Speaker John Boehner.

Broun has proposed resolutions to make 2010 the year of the Bible and pushed for a Ten Commandments week and authored such legislation. He also authored a resolution to amend the Constitution to allow for the castration of anyone convicted of raping a child under age 16. The resolution was referred to the House subcommittee on the Constitution, civil rights and civil liberties. He’s been a vocal proponent of major cuts in federal spending.

Bullock said being ultraconservative may have helped Broun in his former district. Broun’s new district has portions of metro Atlanta counties that are less rural and, perhaps, less conservative, Bullock said.

""Certainly, Broun is one of the most conservative members [of Congress],"" Bullock said.

Simpson sent us a link to the website Open Congress, which tracks legislation. It says Broun sponsored 21 bills in the current congressional term and none passed. Georgia’s 12 other House members have sponsored 157 pieces of legislation since January 2011. Only three have been made into law.

PolitiFact Georgia reviewed each piece of legislation Broun has filed since 2007. Most of his bills were forwarded to various House committees. There were a handful of amendments to bills and resolutions that Broun sponsored that did pass. They included:
  

Broun’s congressional office sent us other amendments that were approved by the House. Some, it said, are effectively legislation and as important as a standard bill. One agreed to in 2009 required that the Energy Department give Congress an annual report describing activities taken in the prior year, a strategic funding plan and other details. Other amendments reduced spending in the Office of the Secretary of Energy by $2.5 million, cutting funding by $181,500 from the Marine Mammal Commission and reducing $878,000 in spending by the Congressional Research Service.

Simpson said the amendments are not comparable to standard resolutions because the amount of money involved is minute in comparison to the federal budget, which is more than $3 trillion.

""In the scheme of things, it’s not that much money,"" Simpson said. 

Kyle Kondik, who follows House races at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, noted that the House was under Democratic control during Broun’s first three years in Congress. It’s very difficult for a younger member of the minority party to get legislation passed, Kondik said. Broun’s position on some issues to the right of GOP House leadership may not have endeared the congressman with those who have the power to shepherd his legislation into law, Kondik said.

The number of bills authored by Broun that have passed ""may or may not be a true measure of his performance as a congressman,"" Kondik said.

Bullock said there may be some reasons why the representative has not had more resolutions passed.

""He’s not particularly [a senior member of Congress],"" Bullock said. ""He’s not chair of a committee. He’s not really in a position to enact legislation.""

Broun has authored some amendments that have been approved by the majority of his fellow House members. There have been a handful of resolutions that passed as well. The experts we spoke with offered some context that offers the congressman a defense, such as the difficulty of being a Republican attempting to get legislation passed when Democrats controlled Congress. With that context, we rate Simpson’s claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097703200>],/factchecks/2012/jun/15/stephen-simpson/ga-congressmans-record-skimpy-opponent-says/

Josh Mandel campaign says Sherrod Brown ""gave huge bonuses"" to executives
","
Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican hoping to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown from the U.S. Senate in November, mixes attacks on Brown with promotion of his own candidacy in his 30-second TV ad ""Change.""

Brown ""gave huge bonuses to executives,"" the announcer and onscreen graphic say.

PolitiFact Ohio checked out the ad’s claim.

The ad cites Brown's Feb. 13, 2009, vote on H.R. 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus. It also cites a March 17, 2009, article in The New York Times about the outcry over disclosures that the American International Group paid $165 million in bonuses. The story does not mention Brown.

When PolitiFact Ohio contacted Mandel's campaign, also cited a Fox Business story that the stimulus legislation allowed firms like AIG, which had received funds through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to give out executive bonuses that had been agreed on prior to the bill becoming law.

President George W. Bush pressed Congress to approve TARP to rescue the financial industry and avert what many feared could be a doomsday economic collapse. The Senate approved it 74-25 on Oct. 1., 2008. Brown and Ohio's then-Sen. George Voinovich were among the the 39 Democrats, 34 Republicans and one independent senator who voted for it.

Mandel has been publicly critical of Brown’s vote for TARP, which Mandel says he would have opposed.

But the root of the statement that Brown ""gave huge bonuses to executives"" isn’t in TARP. It is a provision of the stimulus legislation that allowed the AIG bonuses.

The final stimulus bill included restrictions on bonuses that were less stringent than those in an earlier version of the legislation. The earlier Senate version of the stimulus bill, which Brown voted for, would have capped executive pay and forbidden any firm that received TARP funds from giving out bonuses.

No such restriction was in the version passed by the House. When the two versions went to closed-door conference negotiations to work out a final compromise, the ban was rewritten to allow bonuses be paid on contracts signed before the bill's passage. That means bonuses that the companies, negotiating with their employees, had already approved.

Then-Sen. Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democratic who was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote the amendment in the first Senate version of the stimulus bill that would have banned all bonuses. He said his amendment was altered before final passage at the request of the White House and the Treasury Department.

""At the time,"" the Wall Street Journal reported, ""few objected to that move, which was designed to ensure the measure was constitutional."" 
So where does that leave the Mandel claim?

Brown did vote for the final version of the stimulus bill. But to label the stimulus bill as a vote to give ""huge bonuses to executives"" isn’t just inaccurate and misleading, it’s ridiculous.  

Brown, in fact, had voted to ban all bonuses, but that ban was loosened in House-Senate negotiations before the final version was enacted. The legislation prohibited use of federal money for future bonuses.

But the bill did not enable bonus-paying that would not have existed otherwise. More importantly, while the bill did not prevent the AIG bonuses, it is not accurate to say that the bill -- or Brown -- ""gave"" anything. AIG gave the bonuses to its executives before the stimulus legislation was approved.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim that Brown ""huge bonuses to executives"" rates Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C1F900>],/factchecks/2012/jun/15/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-campaign-says-sherrod-brown-gave-huge-/

Barack Obama coming after guns, 'under the radar,' NRA says
","
President Barack Obama has shown little interest in peddling a gun control agenda during his first term, but the National Rifle Association is urging its members not to let its guard down ahead of the 2012 election.

In a new mailer, forwarded to us by a reader, the gun rights group lists ""Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad for the Second Amendment."" We’ve been exploring several claims on the list this week -- you can see our findings here.

A crucial point to the don’t-sleep-on-Obama thinking comes in as reason No. 10 on the NRA list: ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’""

The quote and the claim struck us as interesting because 1.) It’s typically not smart to say you’re doing something ""under the radar,"" if you’re actually doing something under the radar, and 2.) It suggests something of a conspiracy because Sarah Brady is a prominent gun control advocate, having helped create the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence with her husband Jim. (We’re assuming you know the Brady story, but if you don’t -- this will help.)

We decided to check it out.

While the NRA didn’t respond to our questions about the claim, we found the genesis of the Obama quote easy enough.

It comes from a 2011 Washington Post profile of White House gun policy adviser Steve Croley. It’s not a direct quote from Obama, rather it’s Brady recalling to Post reporter Jason Horowitz her meeting with Obama on March 30, 2011, the 30th anniversary of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.

Here’s what Horowitz wrote:

During the meeting, President Obama dropped in and, according to Sarah Brady, brought up the issue of gun control, ""to fill us in that it was very much on his agenda,"" she said.

""I just want you to know that we are working on it,"" Brady recalled the president telling them. ""We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar.""

In the meeting, she said, Obama discussed how records get into the system and what can be done about firearms retailers. Her husband specifically brought up the proposed ban on large magazine clips, and she noted that even former Vice President Dick Cheney had suggested that some restrictions on the clips might make sense.

""He just laughed,"" Sarah Brady said approvingly of the president. Both she and her husband, she emphasized, had absolute confidence that the president was committed to regulation.

The rest of the Post article focuses on how Democrats and the Obama administration have largely ignored gun control issues, how Obama has failed to deliver on a promise to eliminate an amendment requiring the FBI to destroy records of gun buyers’ background checks, and how Obama chose to avoid a debate over gun issues in the weeks and months after the shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

We contacted Post reporter Jason Horowitz, who declined to comment.

To recap: The Washington Post reported that Sarah Brady said Obama told her his administration is ""working on it,"" likely referring to gun control (in what way is unclear in the article). And Brady then tells the Post Obama said, ""We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar.""

The quote then gets distorted by the NRA to ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’""

Although the wording leaves plenty of room for interpretation, it's not accurate to summarize that quote by saying  ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns"" because the specifics of Obama’s comment -- as relayed by Brady -- are unknown.

We contacted Brady, who told us her quote has been misinterpreted and that she herself never spoke with Obama about gun policy.

""I so remember (Jason) Horowitz -- he was at the press get-together in the briefing room after our meeting. (Her husband) Jim was asked lots of questions -- then (Horowitz) followed me as we walked out of the briefing room until he got back into the main part of the West Wing. He kept trying to pin me down -- asking what I thought -- I was trying to be evasive as I didn't want to paint Obama as with us or against us -- as we hadn't really talked about it. If I remember correctly, I just kept shaking my head and trying to get away from him. What ever I might have said or agreed to was purely speculative as I never spoke to the president myself about this issue.""

We also spoke with one of the few other people in the room during the meeting between the Bradys and Obama -- Paul Helmke, the former president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

Helmke told us he did not recall Obama making any specific promises on gun issues, and that if Obama was talking about anything, it was likely a proposal to require gun shops in border states to report purchases of two or more of semi-automatic rifles if they were made within a five-day window by the same person.

The federal proposal was first considered in December 2010, and went through a lengthy public comment process during the first six months of 2011. The rule was implemented in July, though it is being challenged in court by the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

Helmke said the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence had been discussing the proposal to better track multiple sales of semi-automatic rifles with the Department of Justice before meeting with the president.

""I don't think (Obama) should be seen as referencing anything more than just requiring border-area gun dealers to report multiple sales of long guns,"" Helmke said.

If that context is correct, Obama’s statements fall far short of what the NRA claims, namely that Obama is ""coming for our guns.""

But even if Helmke is wrong, the NRA -- which did not respond to us -- has produced no evidence that the president is crafting a plot to take away firearms. Not through his policies. Or his words.

On top of that, the context of the quote is being challenged by the person who gave it -- Brady.

Our ruling

In a mailer, the National Rifle Association says that  ""Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’ ""

We found no evidence of an Obama admission anything like the NRA suggests. 
What happened is Brady gave an interview to the Washington Post, where she recalled what the president said to her during a private meeting. 
But the NRA makes a tremendous leap by concluding that the quote shows that ""Obama admits he's coming for our guns."" A person at the meeting said Obama was likely referring to an in-the-works program to get gun dealers in border states to forward some gun purchases to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Brady says she never talked to Obama about gun policy.

The NRA has taken a fragment of an unclear quote and prescribed the most far-reaching, conspiratorial conclusion. There simply isn't enough evidence for such a sweeping claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.

Barack Obama proposes major cuts to federal 'Armed Pilots Program'
","
The National Rifle Association is out with a Top 10-style list detailing why President Barack Obama is anti-gun. We’re investigating several of the claims on the list. You can see all our fact-checks by clicking back here throughout the week.

Today, we tackle the No. 6 reason why President Barack Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment: ""Obama is trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks.""

(For the record, the NRA list doesn’t rank one reason as being worse than another, so the fact that this claim is No. 6 doesn’t mean it's more serious than, say, No. 10, ""Obama admits he's coming for our guns ..."")

The ""Armed Pilots Program"" is officially called the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It’s pretty much what it sounds like.

The federal government has budgeted $25 million a year to deputize and train volunteer commercial pilots to carry firearms on commercial flights. The federal government has not said how many pilots take part.

In the FY 2013 budget, Obama proposed to cut the program’s funding roughly in half, to $12 million.

Here’s how the administration explained the cut in its budget request:

""The Administration proposes to reduce funding for the FFDO program (i.e., deputized, armed pilots) in 2013. As the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses its aviation security activities on programs that mitigate the highest amount of risk at the lowest cost, the Budget has prioritized funding in the same manner. The voluntary FFDO program was created as a ‘last defense’ layer of security at a time when comprehensive aviation screening and other physical security measures were not fully developed or deployed on a system-wide basis. Since 2001, however, there have been a number of enhancements to aviation security. TSA now conducts 100 percent screening of all passengers and their carryon items, has overseen installation of reinforced and locking cockpit doors on aircraft that operate in U.S. airspace, and has increased passenger and flight crew awareness to address security risks. Combined, these improvements have greatly lowered the chances of unauthorized cockpit access and represent a comprehensive and redundant risk-mitigation strategy that begins well before passengers board the aircraft.""

In short, the Obama administration said that arming pilots isn’t as important as it use to be, given other security improvements.

Transportation Security Administrator John Pistole also said that the agency has had trouble coordinating schedules of armed pilots, whose flights are set by the airlines, with those of U.S. air marshals managed by the TSA, according to Bloomberg. ""In an ideal world, one without budget constraints, we would fully fund the program. We’re not in that environment, so we are taking reductions,"" he said.

The Republican-led House disagreed.

On June 6, 2012, the House voted not only to reverse Obama’s proposed cuts but to increase the program’s budget to $35 million.

""9/11 woke us up to the reality that we live in a dangerous world. With varied and ever-emerging threats, every effort should be made to make air travel as safe as possible,"" said Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minn., who sponsored the amendment. (Cravaack is a former Northwest Airlines pilot who says he was in the Armed Pilots Program.)

Lastly we checked with Brian Darling, a senior fellow for government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has been following the issue. Darling noted that the Armed Pilots Program had been funded at the same level since its inception, and that Obama’s decision to cut the program in half seems more like a policy choice than something prompted by budget constraints.

Still, the savings are relatively small. The $12 million-$13 million in potential savings comprises about 0.15 percent of the entire TSA $7.6 billion proposed budget.

Our ruling

The NRA claimed that Obama is ""trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks.""

The Armed Pilots Program was created post-Sept. 11, 2001, to serve as a last-line of defense in a terror attack. And Obama, in his FY 2013 budget proposal, did propose cutting the budget for the program in half.

Obama says the program isn’t as critical as it once was. But that doesn’t contradict the NRA’s claim. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097730800>],/factchecks/2012/jun/14/national-rifle-association/barack-obama-proposes-major-cuts-federal-armed-pil/

Revenue, they note, is a big piece off all of this.

""Oregon’s system produces revenue that funds alcohol treatment and other services. This biennium, liquor sales account for nearly $1 billion in the state budget. Regardless of feelings about the state being in the alcohol business, real money is at stake. The impact of regulatory changes on an already strained budget, including funding for our schools and public safety agencies, cannot be ignored.""

Oregon’s general fund -- the money that legislators most often refer to as ""the budget"" -- is about $15 billion in all, so that $1 billion figure caught us by surprise. We wanted to know whether it was true.

The Oregon Liquor Control Commission is in charge of liquor sales in the state and keeps a close eye on the distribution of revenues. According to its figures, the commission brought in some $460 million in sales, license fees and taxes for the 2010-11 fiscal year.

That’s just a single year, though, so the Commission pulls in more than $900 million in a biennium -- nearly the $1 billion that the two representatives mentioned. But here’s the rub: not much of that money goes back into the state budget.

More than half of what the Commission brings in goes back into agency expenditures, liquor agent compensation and inventory purchases. The rest gets split among the state, counties and cities and a couple other areas.

So, for the 2009-2011 biennium, the state general fund received just under $200 million in liquor sales revenues.

We called the representatives to see what had happened with their commentary.

Rep. Kennemer was immediately apologetic. ""I am embarrassed and sorry,"" he said. The $1 billion figure came from total revenues, ""unfortunately we didn't get the rest of the verbiage corrected.""

Rep. Garrett offered similar reasoning. ""It's a billion-dollar business.""

It’s true that the representatives had a basis for the $1 billion figure, but to say that liquor sales account for that much of the state budget is inaccurate -- and the representatives realized that when we checked in.

We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F19C0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/14/chris-garrett-bill-kennemer/do-liquor-sales-account-1-billion-state-budget/

Obama attacks Romney over 40,000 lost manufacturing jobs in Massachusetts and state falling to 47th in job creation
","
In the presidential campaign, the TV ads have been a battle of numbers.

The latest come from President Barack Obama, who highlighted Mitt Romney’s job record in a advertisement airing in New Hampshire and around the country titled, ""We’ve heard it all before.""

""When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average, and fell to 47th in job creation, fourth from the bottom,"" Obama claims.

PolitiFact has addressed both parts before and rated them both Half True.

In checking Obama’s claim about manufacturing jobs under Romney, PolitiFact National turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data, and examined state-level, seasonally adjusted data for manufacturing jobs during Romney’s tenure -- from January 2003 to January 2007.

Over that period, Massachusetts manufacturing jobs declined from 336,000 to 298,200 -- a difference of 38,000 jobs. So It’s not 40,000, but it’s close.

As for the second part of the claim -- the rate of decrease -- Massachusetts manufacturing jobs fell by 11.3 percent over the four-year period. The drop for the nation was 5.8 percent. That means the Massachusetts decline was nearly twice that of the nation, as the ad claimed.

So the Obama campaign is right about the manufacturing jobs numbers.

But it's worth pointing out that the numbers before and after Romney’s term reveal that the manufacturing job loss under Romney (11.3 percent) was slower than it was in either the previous four-year period (16.7 percent) or the successive four-year period (15.1 percent). This weakens the Obama campaign’s argument.

As for the part about job creation, Obama adviser David Axelrod recently threw out the same ""47th-in-job-creation"" claim on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" and scored a Half True on the Truth-O-Meter.

PolitiFact National used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, looking at figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. Since the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, PolitiFact used the data for December of each year as a baseline.

From December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth, calculated by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states. Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse.

So, the numbers check out again.

But in rating claims like these, PolitiFact also interviews experts about how much the target of the attack deserves blame for the numbers. And quite often, experts say it's a stretch to blame a governor for the complex things that happen in a state economy.

""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder.

""The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered.""

(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

There are lots of ways to present jobs data. And the statistics can often be manipulated so that competing campaigns can make equal and opposite conclusions.

The Romney campaign also has put its own twist on jobs creation data, pointing to figures that show Massachusetts' percentage of job growth improving from 49th out of 50 during 2003 to 36th during 2006. The campaign has noted that Massachusetts added more than 47,000 jobs over the course of his administration--a gross number that fails to factor in job losses during Romney’s time as governor.

Our ruling

Obama used accurate figures for the number and rate of manufacturing job losses in Massachusetts under Romney. He also gives the correct ranking for Massachusetts’ job creation during Romney’s tenure. But Obama exaggerated Romney’s impact on the Bay State job market, an impact that experts stress is minor at best.

Also, it's important to note that the the manufacturing job loss under Romney (11.3 percent) was slower than it was in either the previous four-year period (16.7 percent) or the successive four-year period (15.1 percent). This weakens the Obama campaign’s argument.

Was Florida's Bill Nelson ""the deciding vote"" on the health care law?
","
A conservative senior citizens group, the 60 Plus Association, launched a $1.1 million ad buy in June attacking U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., for his votes on health care and the stimulus. The ad says:

""Times have been tough in Florida. Almost 1 million out of work. Businesses shutting down. Thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure. But in Washington, Bill Nelson supports President Obama’s policies that hurt hardworking taxpayers. He voted for Obama’s failed $800 billion stimulus, but employment still went up, and was the deciding vote for the health care law that cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs. Tell Bill Nelson, protect hardworking taxpayers. Stop the wasteful spending.""

The ad repeats a number of charges against Obama and Democrats who supported him. For example, PolitiFact has fact-checked the claim by the U.S. Chamber that Nelson voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare and ruled it Mostly False.

For this report, we wanted to check if Nelson cast the ""deciding vote"" for the health care law.

The claim has been made before about other Democratic senators. PolitiFact has fact-checked that the ""deciding"" vote for health care was U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado.

How can so many lawmakers cast the deciding vote?

The 2009 health care vote

For its evidence, the ad cited a health care vote on Dec. 24, 2009. That vote showed 59 Democrats and one independent voting together in favor of the bill, including Nelson. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.)

So couldn’t we argue that any of the 60 cast the deciding vote?

As we noted before, there is a long history of senators holding back their votes until their demands are met. Some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson wasn’t one of them.

One of the detailed reports we’ve seen on the final negotiations for the law is from the Los Angeles Times. According to its report, one of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.

According to the newspaper, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., ""knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward.""

At the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who also ""had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal.""

Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade.

""Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,"" the Los Angeles Times article reported. ""And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.""

There was also a concern about whether Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., would physically be unable to reach the chamber because he had been in the hospital with a staph infection but he was brought in in a wheelchair and voted.

Bill Nelson’s role

In the summer of 2009, Bill Nelson was quiet about health care reform -- angering some Democratic activists. But in September he jumped into the fray -- offering amendments about Medicare Advantage and Medicare drug benefits. Nelson sounded cautiously supportive in news accounts -- saying he had some criticisms but called the bill a ""starting point.""

""There are serious issues to be resolved,"" Nelson said in a speech on the floor of the Senate in September 2009. ""This senator is optimistic, and I believe that we are going to be able to achieve this goal of expanding affordable health care to nearly all Americans.""

In October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson called the package a ""good start."" 

In November during public stops in the Tampa Bay area, he predicted the Senate would pass a health care bill and said: ""If we don't do something about health care, it's going to run our country into bankruptcy."" The Orlando Sentinel described him as an ""enthusiastic cheerleader for the emerging legislation.""

After the December vote, the health care bill still needed changes and another round of approvals. Nelson’s office issued a press release in March 2010 saying that despite the legislation’s ""flaws"" -- including that it didn’t force drug makers to reduce the costs of prescriptions -- he would support it.

""Nelson, who had been considered by some to be a possible swing vote, made his declaration just at the outset of Senate starting its deliberations on changes to the health care signed into law by President Obama yesterday,"" stated Nelson’s press release.

The other Nelson's role

When the recent ad from the 60 Plus Association started airing, Nelson pointed to his colleague U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., as the deciding vote. Florida’s Nelson wrote on his Facebook page that the 60 Plus Association ""repeats an outrageous claim that I cast the deciding vote on health care reform legislation that cuts Medicare. First off, fact-checkers have found the legislation didn’t cut Medicare. And second, it was BEN NELSON, not me, who cast the deciding vote.""

Several news articles described Sen. Ben Nelson as the final key for Senate Democrats in 2009. The Nebraska senator announced his support days before the Christmas Eve vote, after he reached a compromise about abortion and federal funding for his state. But in March 2010 the Nebraska senator voted against the final bill.

The Nebraska senator told CNN in December 2009: ""I couldn’t create the opportunity to be the 60th vote. It happened. … If you think it’s fun having both sides on an issue mad at you when you are trying to do something in good faith, just think it’s like going home and getting bit by the family dog. So who enjoys that?""

Sen. Bill Nelson’s Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin told PolitiFact in an email: ""There’s no way every Democratic senator could have cast the ‘deciding vote.’ And there’s no way to say Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote - when he didn’t. Nelson didn’t like the bill. He tried to improve it. Among other things, he offered an amendment against the drug-makers. And, he announced his vote well before the roll call. He played no extraordinary role in the final passage.""

We asked the 60 Plus Association how it concluded that Sen. Bill Nelson was the deciding vote and forwarded the Florida senator’s Facebook comments about Sen. Ben Nelson.

""Seems very odd that (Sen. Bill Nelson) would call out a colleague as a deciding vote for legislation he wholeheartedly supported,"" said Gerry Scimeca, a spokesman for the 60 Plus Association, in an email. ""The fact is, had Nelson voted ‘no’ Obamacare would have died. Without his vote, the law couldn't have passed; he could have stopped it but he didn't."" 

Our ruling

The 60 Plus Association says that Florida Sen. Bill Nelson cast the ""deciding vote"" for health care. The health care law required 60 votes, so Nelson's vote was crucial -- as were the other 59 votes. But describing Nelson as the ""deciding vote"" suggests he had some extraordinarily powerful role, and that’s not the case. Nelson had cautiously been a supporter for months as he tried to amend the law. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B2FC0>],/factchecks/2012/jun/14/60-plus-association/florida-bill-nelson-deciding-vote-health-care/

GOP U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos slams incumbent Robert Menendez over Wall Street donations
","
When it comes to raising money from Wall Street, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos recently offered a clear distinction between him and Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez.

Menendez is the ""king"" of such donations, while Kyrillos has received nothing of the sort, he said.

""The guys in Washington – including my opponent, Senator Menendez – they govern by press release, and so, it’s laughable to talk about the Wall Street thing, because he’s the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate,"" Kyrillos, a state senator, said in a June 6 interview on NJToday. ""I haven’t raised any Wall Street money at all.""

PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Kyrillos needs to check his own campaign account.

He’s right about Menendez being one of the leading recipients in the U.S. Senate of donations from the Securities & Investment industry, if not exactly the ""king."" But Kyrillos is wrong to say he hasn’t received any such donations, when records show he has collected nearly $60,000 for his current campaign.

To analyze Kyrillos’ claim, we researched data available on OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan website tracking political donations. The website is managed by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics.

The latest data on the Securities & Investment industry includes figures released by the Federal Election Commission on June 4 -- two days before Kyrillos’ interview. The donations tallied on the website represent contributions of $200 or more from employees and political action committees within the industry.

According to that data, Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the industry between 1989 and 2012. Menendez served as a congressman for 13 years before joining the Senate in 2006.

That amount puts Menendez in 15th place among the nation’s 100 Senators for such donations, according to data on OpenSecrets.org. The 14 Senators with greater donations than Menendez include six Democrats, seven Republicans and one Independent.

The leading recipient is former presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), who has received about $11.2 million from the Securities & Investment industry.

In a statement, Menendez’s campaign manager, Michael Soliman, pointed to the senator’s ""long-standing record of championing common sense reforms that have sided with consumers over banks.""

""This silly partisan gotcha attack is absurd - by Joe Kyrlllos’s own standard John McCain, Mark Kirk, Scott Brown and Mitch McConnell - four Republican senator's - are the real Kings of Raising Money from Wall Street,"" Soliman added, referring to other senators who have raised more money from the industry than Menendez.

As for Kyrillos, he has received his share of such donations as well.

According to OpenSecrets.org, Kyrillos has received nearly $60,000 from the Securities & Investment industry for his current campaign.

Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, responded to our findings in a statement: ""You seem to be on a search to find anyway to find our statements not accurate and are missing the main point Senator Kyrillos made—Bob Menendez was cited as a top recipient of Wall Street money and Joe Kyrillos was not.""

Our ruling

As the battle heats up for a U.S. Senate seat, Kyrillos claimed Menendez is ""the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate. I haven’t raised any Wall Street money at all.""

Data on OpenSecrets.org shows that Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the Securities & Investment industry, putting him in 15th place among sitting Senators for such donations. That ranking means Menendez is one of the leading recipients, but it’s an exaggeration to call him ""the king of raising money from Wall Street.""

Also, Kyrillos is wrong about his own fundraising, because he’s received nearly $60,000 from the industry for his current campaign, according to OpenSecrets.org.

We rate the statement Mostly False.
