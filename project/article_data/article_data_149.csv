Wisconsin Assembly speaker Jeff Fitzgerald says the IRS has to add 15,000 employees to administer the new health care law
","
Days before becoming speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, Jeff Fitzgerald was given a national platform to lay into the federal health care reform law that he and other critics call ""ObamaCare.""

On the Dec. 27, 2010, edition of PBS Newshour, the Horicon Republican claimed that ""from the IRS standpoint, 15,000 new employees have to be added just to, you know, administer ObamaCare and look at the tax implications.""

That’s a big, round number, so let’s check Fitzgerald’s math.  

Since President Barack Obama signed the reforms into law in March 2010, attacks by opponents have increased. In January 2011, Wisconsin moved to join 20 other states in a federal court lawsuit in Florida that seeks to overturn the law.

To assess Fitzgerald’s claim, we asked his spokesman, former Milwaukee radio personality John Jagler, for the source of the 15,000 jobs figure. Jagler said it came from the Thomas More Law Center in Michigan.

The public-interest law firm, which says it represents Christians and their religious beliefs, filed a suit in federal court in Michigan that is similar to the Florida case that Wisconsin wants to join.

After a Michigan judge upheld the health care reforms law -- in a ruling the law center is appealing -- law center president Richard Thompson issued a statement. It said the health reforms will ""add an estimated 16,000 to 20,000 additional IRS agents to monitor tax returns and records to determine compliance with the new regulations.""  

So, Fitzgerald was slightly more conservative with his 15,000 claim.

We checked with the IRS, which said it has not settled on a number or even done its own jobs estimate. So any number out there presented as fact is problematic.

Back to the Thomas More Law Center number.

Thompson arrived at his 16,000 to 20,000 estimate after reviewing articles by conservative think tanks and news outlets, according to law center spokeswoman Kate Lynch. Those articles cited a March 2010 Republican report from the House Ways and Means Committee, she said.

That report didn’t use numbers as high as Thompson’s. It said the IRS ""may need to hire as many as 16,500 additional auditors, agents and other employees to investigate and collect billions in new taxes from Americans"" in connection with the health care reform law.

The Republican report’s estimate was based in part on a November 2009 financial impact estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The budget office projected that administering the law will cost the IRS between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years.

The nine-page Republican report cited the 16,500 jobs figure five times. However, as our colleagues at PolitiFact National pointed out, the report also hedged its estimate, saying in a footnote that the number of additional IRS jobs likely will be between 11,800 and 16,500.

Let’s circle back.

Fitzgerald claimed that 15,000 IRS employees ""have to be added"" to manage the health care reform law, as if it’s a settled point. There’s little question more IRS workers will have to be added, but the agency has not set a number. And there is no evidence that 15,000 will be the final number, though it is within the range of one government estimate, albeit one done for House Republicans.

We rate Fitzgerald’s statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978B9F80>],/factchecks/2011/jan/14/jeff-fitzgerald/wisconsin-assembly-speaker-jeff-fitzgerald-says-ir/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Mike Haridopolos']","
Florida Senate president warns of education funding cuts
","
A budget storm is brewing in Tallahassee, and Senate President Mike Haridopolos is making clear that no agency, program or area may be spared from impending cuts.

Haridopolos, R-Merritt Island, met with reporters on Jan. 12, 2011, to offer his outlook regarding Florida's $3.62 billion budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year. Haridopolos predicted that it would be difficult to pursue any significant tax cuts -- like those being championed by Gov. Rick Scott -- and that everyone should expect spending cuts.

That includes education funding, he warned.

More than $3 billion in federal stimulus funds have helped the state fill education budget holes for the past two years, but those funds sunset this spring. And while some additional federal funds are coming available, about $555 million, Florida's budget picture remains bleak, Haridopolos said.

""Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education,"" Haridopolos was quoted as saying in the Orlando Sentinel. ""It's a very difficult spot to be in, and the reason we wanted to make the adjustments to the class-size amendment"" defeated by voters in November. Haridopolos was referring to an amendment proposed by the Legislature to ease class-size requirements at Florida schools so the state could save money. That measure failed to receive the needed 60 percent voter approval to pass.

For this fact check, we decided to zero in on Haridopolos' claim that half of state general revenue goes to fund education.

Understanding the state budget and education funding

In his claim, Haridopolos is talking about a subset of the state budget, which is a subset of state's share of education funding in Florida, which is a subset of overall education funding in Florida. Oh, and he's not just talking about K-12 spending, but also state spending on the state university system, pre-Kindergarten and student aid programs.

We'll walk you through it.

Let's start with the state budget, which you can imagine by picturing a three-legged stool.

Leg one: General revenue (what Haridopolos is talking about). General revenue makes up about 34 percent of the current state budget. The money mostly comes from sales taxes -- though some comes from telephone and cable taxes, corporate income taxes (which Scott has vowed to phase out), and taxes on property transactions. The state has broad discretion on how general revenue is spent.

Leg two: State trust funds. State trust funds make up about 27 percent of the current state budget. That is money collected by the state to be used for a specific purpose. The state gas tax is funneled into a transportation trust fund, for example, to pay for road building projects. Florida Lottery proceeds roll into the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund. (The Legislature, at times, has raided trust funds to help balance the budget.)

Leg three: Federal dollars. Federal dollars this year comprise about 39 percent of the state budget. Federal dollars primarily fund the state's Medicaid program, but also help fund education, road projects and the criminal justice system.

So while each leg helps fund education programs from pre-K through college, Haridopolos is focusing on the general revenue fund. In the current budget, 56 percent of all state education spending came out of general revenue, and it's the portion of state spending the Legislature can most easily control.

Now, here's a second important primer.

The state doesn't fund education all by itself. Hardly. Local school districts contribute billions of dollars on their own through local property taxes. Most of those property taxes, believe it or not, are set at rates mandated by the Legislature through something called the Required Local Effort. In short, school districts are forced to collect the amount of property taxes the Legislature decides, or the districts won't get to share in state funding.

In addition, there are other property taxes individual school districts have discretion over. None of those funds are technically state revenues for the purpose of this analysis.

If this isn't confusing enough already, the context of Haridopolos' statement also is important. He's talking about potential cuts in education funding because of less federal dollars and lower sales tax receipts that are affecting the state's bottom line. One way to offset those cuts would be to raise the Required Local Effort, but the Republican-led Legislature that sets the tax has been opposed to that idea. 
Drilling down on general revenue

Now, sticking to Haridopolos' statement and examining only general revenue, the Senate president is correct.

Of the $23.8 billion of general revenue budgeted to be spent between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011, $12.5 billion was directed to education -- pre-K through college.

Divide one into the other and you see that education spending currently equals more than 52 percent of general revenue. You can see the full breakdown of general revenue spending on Page 5 of this report.

Haridopolos spokesman David Bishop said the state expects to receive $22.6 billion in general revenue for the 2011-2012 fiscal year.

If you look at the overall state budget, education funding made up about 32 percent ($22.4 billion) of the entire $70 billion state budget in 2010-2011. 
Ruling

As Haridopolos talked in Tallahassee about the grim state budget prospects for this coming year, he said state education funding might see cuts. Part of the problem is just how much of the budget is tied to education funding, he said -- half of the state's general revenue fund.

To be honest, Florida's education funding structure is way more complicated than Haridopolos let on. But he's right that the state general revenue fund, which is a little more than a third of the overall state budget, is being used primarily to fund education.

We rate this statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809710FA80>],/factchecks/2011/jan/14/mike-haridopolos/florida-senate-president-warns-education-funding-c/

Jeb Bush says record number of Hispanics elected to U.S. House of Representatives
","
The 2010 midterm elections saw the rise of the Tea Party, the resurgence of the Republican Party in Congress, and a number of Hispanic candidates elected to prominent positions.

There was Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American elected to the United States Senate; Brian Sandoval, the first Hispanic governor of Nevada; and Susana Martinez of New Mexico, the first Hispanic woman in the country to be elected as governor.

The successes of Hispanic candidates in the midterm elections is a point noted by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in an opinion article he penned for The Miami Herald  on Jan. 9, 2011. In the article, Bush, a Republican, warns that conservatives ""get unacceptably low support among Hispanic voters nationally"" and urges the ""center-right movement … to engage the Hispanic community.""

""The unprecedented success of Hispanic center-right candidates in this past election is a clear sign that now is the time to recommit to a serious outreach effort,"" Bush writes. ""Among these newly-elected Hispanic leaders, there were many notable records and firsts. Marco Rubio was overwhelmingly elected to the U.S. Senate despite starting his campaign as a heavy underdog to more-seasoned candidates. A record number of Hispanics were elected to the U.S House of Representatives, including Republicans Raúl Labrador of Idaho, David Rivera of Florida, Bill Flores and Francisco Canseco from Texas, and Jaime Herrera of Washington.""

He wrote the piece in advance of the Hispanic Leadership Network Conference, which he helped organize. The conference, scheduled for Jan. 13 and 14, 2011, in Coral Gables, is aimed at engaging ""members of the Hispanic community on center-right principles.""

We decided to check the accuracy of Bush’s claim that a record number of Hispanics had been elected to the U.S. House this past election.

First, we turned to Bush for clarification.

His press secretary, Jaryn Emhoff, said Bush's references to ""center-right"" was intended to refer to Hispanic Republicans.

""An earlier sentence sets the stage when it says, ‘The unprecedented success of Hispanic center-right candidates…’,"" Emhoff explained.

To check the validity of Bush’s claim, we turned to the National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO), which keeps track of the progress made by Hispanic-Latino candidates from the local to the national level.

""There was a record number of Hispanic Republicans elected, but not a record number of Hispanics in general,"" said Patricia Guadalupe, spokesperson for the NALEO Educational Fund.

""There were two Latinos who lost their seats to non-Latinos, and in other seats you had one Latino replacing another,"" Guadalupe said.

There are currently 24 Hispanic members of the U.S. House, which matches the record set in 2009 by the incoming class of the 111th Congress.

However, the most notable shift between the two classes is the gain made by Republicans. In 2009, there were 21 Democrats and three Republicans; now, those figures now stand at 17 Democrats and seven Republicans.

During the November 2010 elections, the seven Hispanic Republicans elected to the U.S House were:

• Bill Flores, Texas -- Flores, a political newcomer was able to defeat longtime Rep. Chet Edwards, a Democrat. Flores’ win made him the first Republican Latino to represent Texas’s 17th congressional district.

• Francisco Canseco, Texas -- Canseco, a businessman, defeated Democratic Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, (also Hispanic), for the state’s District 23 congressional seat.

• Jaime Herrera, Washington -- Herrera became the first Hispanic to represent the state in Congress by defeating businessman Danny Heck.

• Raul Labrador, Idaho -- By defeating Democratic incumbent Walter Minnick, Labrador became the state’s first Latino congressman.

• David Rivera, Florida -- Rivera won against Democratic challenger Joe Garcia for the Florida District 25 seat vacated by Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart.

• Mario Diaz-Balart, Florida -- Already a congressman representing District 25, Diaz-Balart opted to run for the District 21 seat being vacated by his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart.

• Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Florida -- The country’s first Hispanic woman elected to Congress retained her seat in a heavily Hispanic and Republican district after running against a lesser-known Democratic candidate, Rolando A. Banciella.

For a complete list of all the Hispanic members of the House elected in 2010, click here.

The number of Hispanics in Congress has been rising steadily. Consider that in 1998, there were 18 Hispanic members in the House and no senators. Fast forward to 2011: There are 24 Hispanics in the House and two Cuban-American senators, Rubio and Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey.

Although the number of Hispanics in the House is the same now as it was after the 2008 election, Bush is correct in recognizing the growth in the past decade. However, he would have been more precise if he’d said that a record number of Hispanic Republicans were elected to the U.S. House, rather than leaving it to the reader’s assumption that he was referring to the GOP. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A6A540>],/factchecks/2011/jan/13/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-record-number-hispanics-elected-us-h/

Did the White House ""brand"" the Arizona memorial service with a logo and slogan?
","The University of Arizona memorial service for the victims of the Tucson, Ariz. shootings was called ""Together We Thrive."" But Michelle Malkin claimed the slogan was cooked up by the White House In an opinion piece about the Jan. 12, 2011, memorial event, Malkin, a conservative pundit, accused the White House of ""branding"" the memorial service with the slogan, complete with its own logo. Malkin noted that all 13,000 people who attended the ""Together We Thrive"" event were given blue and white T-shirts with the logo.

""Can't the Democrat political stage managers give it a break just once?"" Malkin wrote in her column.

The Drudge Report subsequently ran a headline atop its web page, ""Political Theme, T-Shirts at Memorial?"" It linked to an AP photo of ""Together We Thrive"" T-shirts draped over the back of chairs before the memorial service at McKale Memorial Center on the University of Arizona campus.

But officials at the University of Arizona said the White House had nothing to do with the name or the logo.

""The name of the event and the logo for the event were done entirely by the university,"" said Johnny Cruz, a spokesman for the University of Arizona. ""Branding of the event was not done in consultation with the White House, or any elected officials or political organization.""

The T-shirts were also the university's doing, Cruz said.

""That was the university's idea,"" he said. ""We wanted to give people something to remember, to symbolize the community spirit.""

The university bought the shirts without the use of taxpayer dollars, although he wasn't sure if the cost was borne by donations.

""Almost everything was done by the university,"" Cruz said, including selection of the location for the event and planning the agenda. Once the president accepted an invitation, he said, the White House helped coordinate some logistics, such as security, but that was the extent of the White House involvement.

And ""Together We Thrive"" was conceived by a University of Arizona student, he said. White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said during his briefing that the university was responsible for logistics. ""I think it’s important to understand we were invited to and accepted quite happily the invitation of the university,"" he said. We should note that Malkin later added an update to her blog posting that stated, ""As noted above, the University of Arizona announced the Together We Thrive event — and a few readers wrote in to say that the campus initiated the logo/campaign. Given U of A president Robert Shelton's embarrassing, thinly-veiled partisan cheerleading for Obama tonight, it may indeed be a 100 percent-campus-initiated campaign. Given the Obama White House's meticulous attention to stage prop details, however, I would say the odds of involvement by Axelrod/Plouffe & Co. are high.""

But university spokesman Cruz said all of the ""stage prop details,"" as Malkin called them, were entirely conceived by and arranged by the college.

The burden of proof is on Malkin and she has failed to prove any White House involvement. She may believe she sees the handiwork of the White House at play, but there's no evidence to back that up. Certainly not enough to justify her claim the White House used the shooting tragedy as an opportunity to orchestrate a ""branded"" political event. We rate Malkin's claim False.

"['National', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Frank Lautenberg']","
Frank Lautenberg says U.S. has 9,500 gun murders a year, compared to 200 or less in other nations
","
After the Jan. 8, 2011, attack by a gunman in Tucson, Ariz., that left six dead and and 14 wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a number of politicians and pundits brought up the issue of whether stricter gun control laws were needed.

One of the lawmakers who made the case for tightening gun laws was Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. In an interview on MSNBC on Jan. 11, 2011. Lautenberg -- who is preparing legislation to ban high-capacity gun clips like the ones used in the Tucson attack -- said, ""But the fact of the matter is, when we look at the number of murders in the United States, 2009, we had 9,500 people murdered. When we look around the world, we see large companies -- large countries, the U.K., Germany, Japan had 200 or less killed in a year.""

We wondered whether Lautenberg's statistics were correct. First, we'll look at the statistics for the U.S. (Lautenberg said ""murders,"" but the full context of the interview clarifies that he actually meant to say murders by guns.)

According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports for 2009, there were 10,224 homicides in the U.S. that involved a gun. So by this count, Lautenberg's number was actually a little low.

International statistics are harder to come by, but we'll report the best data we could come up with.

Mamoru Suzuki of the National Research Institute of Police Science in Japan e-mailed us to say that there were seven gun murders in Japan during 2009. (This was no anomaly: In 2007 and 2008, Suzuki said, the number was 21 and 10, respectively.)

For the United Kingdom and Germany, we had to extrapolate a bit. We took firearm murder rates -- that is, firearm murders per 1,000 people -- for a variety of nations across the globe, then used national population statistics to reverse-engineer the number of firearm murders in both countries. The data comes from the Seventh United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, covering the period from 1998 to 2000. While more recent data exists for homicides overall, we weren't able to find more recent international figures for killings by firearms specifically.

In any case, for the most recent year available, we found that the United Kingdom had 63 firearm murders, and Germany had 381 firearm murders. These aren't as current as the statistics from U.S. and Japan, and because they're reverse-engineered, they are estimates. But experts we consulted said the figures sounded about right. They were also on par with Canada: Sara Beattie, the homicide survey manager at Statistics Canada, e-mailed us to say that there were 179 firearm homicides in her country in 2009.

So, Japan and the United Kingdom were well within Lautenberg's stated threshold of 200 murders per year. Germany's total exceeded that threshold, but it still represented less than 4 percent of the number of killings in the United States in 2009.

We'll point out three additional bits of context.

The first is that Lautenberg offered an absolute number of killings, not one adjusted according to population size. Population differences can be a significant factor, but in this case, the differences in killings are so great that even adjusting for a country's size doesn't change the comparison very much. 
The second is that while the U.S. firearm murder rate is indeed high when compared to most advanced industrialized countries, there are nations that do have higher rates. In the U.N. study, the U.S. ranked eighth out of 32 nations studied, with South Africa, Colombia, Thailand, Zimbabwe, Mexico, Belarus and Costa Rica reporting higher rates.

The third is that not everyone agrees that guns by themselves are the key factor of the relatively high U.S. rate of firearm murders. ""The U.S. also has a far higher rate of murders committed with knives, but I doubt that cutlery ownership is any higher in the U.S. than in Japan, Germany, and the U.K.,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. ""America is more violent than other nations in ways unrelated to guns and for reasons having nothing to do with the rate of gun ownership.""

We still don't think these pieces of context undermine the accuracy of Lautenberg's statement. The senator was actually a little low in his estimate of firearm homicides in the U.S. for 2009, and he was accurate in saying that Japan and the United Kingdom had fewer than 200 firearm murders. Germany's number is higher than 200, but is still dramatically lower than the U.S. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B03440>],/factchecks/2011/jan/13/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-says-us-has-9500-gun-murders-year/

Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele says opponent Jeff Stone = Scott Walker
","
A doppelganger is a ghostly double of a living person. In German it means ""double walker.""

In the case of a new TV ad from Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele, it would be ""double Scott Walker.""

Naturally, state Rep. Jeff Stone -- Abele’s opponent in the April 5 election -- is the alleged double.

In a new TV ad with B-movie special effects, Abele presents Stone and the new Republican governor as scary, bleached-out phantoms in ideological lockstep on the ""unfair"" state budget repair law. Stone, the ad claims, will copy a Walker agenda that has ""mismanaged"" Milwaukee County government.

""I thought he was Scott Walker’s twin,"" a man identified as David Crowley of Milwaukee County says into the camera. Later, he adds: ""Jeff Stone is Scott Walker.""

Last fall in the governor’s race, we looked at the Republican primary ad Scott Walker used to equate opponent Mark Neumann with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We labeled Walker’s claim -- ""Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi,"" for shorthand -- and found it False.

Here, Abele’s ad essentially equates Stone with Walker.

So: Does Stone = Walker?

Of course, depending on where a voter sits, the degree of similarity could be considered a good thing or a bad thing.

But it’s worth evaluating, because both sides have made Stone’s ties to Walker a theme -- Stone ran as Walker’s logical successor for most of the race, and Abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense.

We asked the Abele campaign to back up the claim. They provided an analysis of voting records and pointed us to public statements and other evidence.

""They are overwhelmingly similar, and Jeff would represent a continuation of Scott Walker’s approach to governing,"" said Brandon Lorenz, Abele’s spokesman.

We’ll look at Walker and Stones’ statements about each other, as well as their voting histories, common causes, priorities, styles and backgrounds.

Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. They served in the Legislature together for about four years -- even carpooling together -- with Walker taking the higher profile.

Walker is seven years younger, at 43, but they got into elected politics within a year of each other. Stone started locally, as a Greenfield city alderman. Walker, from Wauwatosa, won a state Assembly seat.

Both considered the Milwaukee County exec’s job in 2002 after a pension scandal forced out F. Thomas Ament; only Walker jumped in. Stone helped Walker get elected. Now Stone wants to take over for Walker, and the governor says Stone -- whom he has endorsed and raised campaign money for -- would be a crucial local ally in reducing spending.

Stone and Walker’s statements:

Walker touted Stone in February 2010 as a worthy successor, saying he was ""interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas"" that Walker has backed. That confirmed the impression at the Courthouse, dating back years, that Stone was the GOP’s candidate in waiting.

Stone has consistently praised Walker.

It should be noted though that from the start of his campaign he has said that his small-business experience would make him more focused on job creation than Walker, who Stone said was focused primarily on reforming county government after the pension scandal.

Are they close ideologically and by temperament?

Stone said in March 2011 that he and Walker share ""similar aspirations"" and ""a similarity in how we go about things. He urged a conservative audience: ""Vote for the person who’s going to move Milwaukee County forward along the lines of what Scott Walker has.""

Stone’s pre-primary campaign literature implored voters to back him to preserve gains being made during Walker’s tenure.

At times since Walker’s budget attracted massive protests in Madison this winter, Stone cautiously has tried to separate himself. He has said he will be less confrontational.

""I voted for the budget, but I'm not Scott Walker,"" said Stone. ""I'm Jeff Stone. I have a very different way of managing and doing business.""

Stone voted for Walker’s controversial budget-repair law, but later signaled he would not have tried to sharply curtail union bargaining rights if it had been up to him -- a position that earned him a Half Flip.

He voted for the business tax cuts Walker pushed in January’s special session.

Common Assembly voting history:

Stone and Walker overlapped in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002, when Walker was elected county executive. Stone has operated closer to power during his legislative career than did Walker (1993-2002). Stone served on the Legislature’s  budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Walker made his mark mostly on law enforcement issues.

Research by Abele’s camp on more than 1,400 common votes shows Stone and Walker agreed 96 percent of the time. Stone doesn’t dispute that number.

There’s a limit, though, to how much insight comes from examining a mass of votes by two members of the same party, because most lawmakers vote the party line most of the time, and so many votes are minor.

So we looked at some ratings by a sampling of special interest groups on key legislation. The verdict: Stone and Walker have remarkably similar profiles, though not identical ones. 
Top priorities:

On the issues, Stone has adopted Walker’s signature anti-tax stance and similarly endorses smaller government. Stone and Walker jointly have proposed various tax cuts over the years. Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting.

The most notable difference: public transit.

Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue.

""He’s been a great transit advocate for a decade,"" Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone.

There are limits to Stone’s support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walker’s stance against federal help for a high-speed train.

But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament.

Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion.

Experience:

Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to ""do it my way.""

We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares.

He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that he’s made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker.

Their biggest difference, Stone said, is ""vastly different life experiences and what we’ve done in our career."" Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election.

He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker.

""I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker,"" he said at a candidate forum.

Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Let’s review.

Abele’s strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walker’s agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups.

They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stone’s willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stone’s business experience is a notable biographical difference.

In the end, Abele’s equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096891480>],/factchecks/2011/mar/30/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/
"['National', 'Elections', 'Sarah Palin']","
Sarah Palin said ""violence isn't the answer"" at a March campaign rally
","
In the wake of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz., much of the public discussion focused on whether political rhetoric has grown too heated.

Giffords is a Democratic representative from a conservative-leaning district. During the 2010 election, Republicans believed Giffords' seat and others like it were likely wins for their party. Republican Sarah Palin included the district on a map that put the crosshairs of a gun sight over selected districts held by Democrats. Back in March, Giffords herself said in an interview that political rhetoric was growing too heated, and specifically mentioned the map. ""For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list. But the thing is, the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize there's consequences to that action."" (A Palin spokeswoman said they were surveyors marks, not crosshairs.)

To be clear, there's no evidence so far that shooter, Jared Loughner, was involved in politics or even saw the map. Still, some have criticized Palin the wake of the Tuscon shooting for using gun imagery regularly in her public comments.

Several days later, on Jan. 12, 2011, Palin responded to the criticism with a video statement posted to her Facebook account.

""Like millions of Americans I learned of the tragic events in Arizona on Saturday, and my heart broke for the innocent victims. No words can fill the hole left by the death of an innocent, but we do mourn for the victims' families as we express our sympathy,"" Palin said in her statement.

But Palin also rejected those who would blame her.

""Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own,"" Palin said. ""They begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of a state, not with those who listen to talk radio, not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle, not with law-abiding citizens who respectfully exercise their First Amendment rights at campaign rallies, not with those who proudly voted in the last election."" She added that ""journalists and pundits"" were manufacturing a ""blood libel"" that political rhetoric somehow played a part in the shooting.

Palin then noted that she has publicly condemned violence.

""As I said while campaigning for others last March in Arizona during a very heated primary race, 'We know violence isn't the answer. When we ""take up our arms"", we're talking about our vote.' Yes, our debates are full of passion, but we settle our political differences respectfully at the ballot box – as we did just two months ago, and as our Republic enables us to do again in the next election, and the next,"" Palin said.

We wanted to know the context of her comments and if Palin was giving an accurate rendering of them.

We found that Palin was referring to comments she made at a campaign stop with Sen. John McCain in Tuscon. Palin was supporting McCain, who was facing a primary challenge from J.D. Hayworth.

""And hearing the news reports lately, kind of this ginned up controversy about us common-sense conservatives inciting violence because we happen to oppose some of the things in the Obama administration,"" Palin said. ""We know violence isn't the answer. When we take up our arms, we are talking about our vote. We're talking about being involved in a contested primary like this and picking the right candidate, too, John McCain. We thank you for that. But this BS coming from the 'lame stream media' about us inciting violence -- don't let the conversation be diverted. Don't let a distraction like that get you off track. Keep fighting hard for these candidates who are all about the common-sense conservative solutions that we need.""

"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Talmadge Heflin']","
Talmadge Heflin says claims that state government is $27 billion in the red are false
","
After State Comptroller Susan Combs said Jan. 10 that Texas lawmakers will have $72.2 billion in state revenue to budget for fiscal 2012-13 -- $15 billion less than what the state has budgeted for the two years ending Aug. 31, 2011 -- Talmadge Heflin of the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation cautioned against overreaction.

Heflin’s same-date ""legislative update,"" headlined ""the myth of the $27 billion shortfall,"" points out that Combs declined to pinpoint a budget shortfall figure. The post by Heflin, a former Texas House member and past chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, closes: ""This is not to say that the process of developing a 2012-13 state budget will be a walk in the park. But claims that Texas is $27 billion in the red are flat-out false.""

Flat-out for real?

We wondered because news organizations including the Austin American-Statesman included the $27 billion figure in their analyses of Combs’ forecast.

The Statesman’s Jan. 11 news article states: ""The comptroller's estimate sets the limit for spending and would put the budget shortfall at $27 billion if the state were to maintain the same level of service in public education, health and human services, prisons and more.""

Similarly, the San Antonio Express-News quotes Scott McCown, executive director of the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, saying the shortfall is at least $26.8 billion--the difference between Combs’ predicted state income and at least $99 billion in state revenue needed to maintain the current level of services, given the state's growing population and rising costs, including that of health care.

The newspaper quotes Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, saying that a shortfall of at least $27 billion is ""in the ballpark"" when looking at the money needed to provide the current level of services.

In his update, Heflin writes that the $27 billion figure is ""premised on the  belief that the state should carry forward all current spending and assumptions regarding program growth."" He adds that policy advocates touting the figure are simply tallying agencies’ wish lists; his post links to a Legislative Budget Board website compiling requests filed by more than 200 agencies. Heflin’s post continues: ""But these requests are almost never fully funded -- even at the start of the budget process -- because they include many unnecessary spending items that appropriators recognize and quickly weed out.""

Seeking the basis of the $27 billion figure, we contacted McCown, who pointed us to his Jan. 10 statement saying that based solely on requests from several major agencies and expected formula-driven costs of higher education, Texas needs to spend $19.9 billion more in state funds in 2012-13 than what’s budgeted for 2010-11. That would bump the budget to $99 billion, McCown said, which exceeds Combs’ estimate of available state revenue by $27 billion.

According to his statement, the center reached the $19.9 billion figure by adding up requested budget increases tied to population and cost growth made by five agencies -- the Texas Education Agency ($9 billion increase), the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ($8.3 billion increase), the Texas Department of Criminal Justice ($730 million increase), the Employees Retirement System ($576 million increase) and Teacher Retirement System of Texas ($908 million increase). It then added increases for public colleges and universities that would be driven by state higher-education funding formulas, McCown’s statement says. All told, the statement says, the selected agencies and education institutions account for 82 percent of state spending.

Footnotes to the center’s summary of its calculations indicate that more than $8 billion in the identified education and health and human services funding is needed to replace federal stimulus aid used in the last budget but not expected again this year.

Eva DeLuna Castro, the center’s senior budget analyst, said she excluded some of the selected agencies’ requests, such as one for staffing a health center for prisoners, that don’t reflect what the agencies are already doing.

In an interview, McCown said those who question the shortfall ""are not being honest. They’re trying to confuse the public . . . We’re short $27 billion to do what we’re doing. Obviously, if you don’t want to do what we’re doing, then we’re not short.""

According to the Statesman, state leaders including GOP Gov. Rick Perry are dismissive of needing to cover $27 billion in additional spending. Perry said in a Jan. 10 interview with the newspaper: ""I'll let somebody else talk about that, because that's not reality.""

In the end, we suppose, the final budget and its impact will determine reality. 
But that’s down the road. For now, what legislative budget-writers have to go on are what they always have early in the process: State agencies’ self-reported funding needs. And for now, it looks like the cost to continue services as they are exceeds the $27 billion suggested by the CPPP's analysis, which did not consider all agency requests.

Finally, we followed up with Heflin, who said in an interview that he composed his post before reading McCown’s numerical analysis. Heflin said he has no quibble with its methodology, but disputes the premise that lawmakers should maintain existing services. When ""you know you don’t have the money, you know you have to trim back,"" Heflin said. He followed up via e-mail: ""There was never a possibility of funding a current-services’ budget plus wish lists and growth.""

Our sense: Heflin’s statement rejects a shortfall calculation that seems a reasonable way to estimate how much it would cost Texas to keep up services. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FD4E00>],/factchecks/2011/jan/12/talmadge-heflin/talmadge-heflin-says-claims-state-government-27-bi/
"['Ohio', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Robert Hagan']","
Rep. Robert Hagan slams Wal-Mart over workers needing public assistance
","
In addition to its reputation for low prices, Wal-Mart is recognized by some as a company that puts profits ahead of its workers’ well-being. State Rep. Robert Hagan, a Youngstown Democrat, capitalized on that distinction last month when he publicly chastised the megastore for all the public assistance its workers in Ohio receive.

Ohio taxpayers’ contribution to public assistance for Wal-Mart workers was the focus of a Dec. 8 speech Hagan gave on the floor of the Ohio House of Representatives as he advocated for legislation he sponsored to shed light on employers with high number of workers on welfare. The bill failed that day, the last day of session.

Ohio taxpayers spent more than $67 million ""for the year"" on food stamps and Medicaid for Wal-Mart workers, Hagan said.

Hagan made clear he does not wish to reduce public assistance to those who need it. But he questioned why so many workers at Wal-Mart — which boasted $405 billion in sales last year — live in poverty and need Medicaid and food stamps.

Spending on welfare programs, especially Medicaid, will be under the microscope this year as state officials confront a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to look more closely at Hagan’s claim.

We checked with his office and were told the claim was based on a report the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services generated last year at Hagan’s request.

The report listed companies on a monthly basis who employed the most workers receiving various forms of public assistance, including Medicaid and food stamps, from July 2008 to August 2009.

Hagan zeroed in on June 2009 for his attack on Wal-Mart, which topped the Medicaid and food stamps lists in the report nearly every month.

As we studied the report, we realized Hagan had to extrapolate certain figures to reach the conclusion that $67 million was spent on Medicaid and food stamps for Wal-Mart workers.

Despite the overall fuzziness of Hagan’s math, which we will attempt to clarify momentarily, he did nail one statistic in his formula: the number of Wal-Mart workers and their dependents on public assistance.

The Department of Job and Family Services tapped into its centralized system that caseworkers use to issue benefits and reported to Hagan that 15,484 Wal-Mart workers and dependents received Medicaid benefits in June 2009, and 12,872 Wal-Mart workers and dependents got food stamps.

Hagan then multiplied those totals by the average costs in June 2009 of Medicaid and food stamps per recipient. The resulting costs for June 2009 then were annualized to calculate the annual total.

This is what it looks like:

$245 average cost (X) 15,484 recipients (X) 12 months = $45.5 million.

Hagan used the same formula and the same reports to figure the annual amount of food-stamp assistance Wal-Mart workers received.

$142.40 average cost (X) 12,872 recipients (X) 12 months = $22 million.

Put both figures together and you get $67.5 million.

While the number matches Hagan’s claim, it also has some problems.

First, his cost-per-recipient figures are averages and are not specifically tied to the thousands of Wal-Mart workers on welfare.

The food-stamp average of $142.40 was derived from a Department of Job and Family Services report — separate from the one Hagan requested — that dissected public assistance spending in June 2009. The report showed more than $205 million in food stamp coupons were issued to more than 1.4 million people for an average of $142.40 per person.

The Medicaid average only accounts for only one type of Medicaid coverage, the Covered Families and Children program, which is most common among numerous types of Medicaid benefits. Using just the Covered Families and Children figure assumes all of Wal-Mart’s recipients are on that plan.

Department of Job and Family Services spokesman Ben Johnson said there’s no way to tell what type of Medicaid coverage was applied to the more than 15,000 Wal-Mart workers and dependents who received assistance in June 2009.

Lastly, Hagan’s math assumes the assistance Wal-Mart workers received in June 2009 is consistent each month for a year. A closer look at the report, which lists public assistance recipients on a monthly basis, shows little fluctuation in the number of recipients connected to Wal-Mart. But the monthly totals are never exactly the same.

For all those reasons, Johnson said Hagan’s formulas produced an inexact figure to quantify the annual amount of public assistance Wal-Mart receives.

""We would certainly take issue with that premise,"" Johnson said.

Hagan’s method is something PolitiFact Ohio and The Plain Dealer might try to get a ballpark figure when exact figures aren’t available, but Hagan presented it as a precise figure. He later acknowledged his figures were not 100 percent exact, but said the goal of his failed legislation was to shed light on companies with thousands of workers on welfare.

Even if Ohio taxpayers don’t pay exactly $67 million in Medicaid and food stamps, it is clear they are subsidizing Wal-Mart’s health care costs, Hagan said.

So where does Hagan land on the Truth-O-Meter?

"['Education', 'Health Care', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
Allen West says feds are going to ""take over"" education
","You've heard the one about the ""federal government takeover"" of health care, but how about the feds taking over education?

U.S. Rep. Allen West, a Republican from South Florida who took office Jan. 5, 2011, has a beef with government takeovers.

On Fox News Jan. 2, West said (around page 3 of the transcript): ""When you look at the things that happen in our country and the nationalization of so much of our production -- being it an automobile industry, being it a health care industry, being the fact that we had an amendment in the health care law that said the federal government is going to take over education.""

A day later, this time on CNN, he again spoke critically about health care legislation connected to a change in education loans. In response to a question by host John King related to jobs and health care, West said:

""But this health care law is tied to jobs because when you look at the 52-employee rule, a lot of people are not going to have more than 52 employees because of the threat of the high cost. And we also see that insurance premiums are already going up for Americans. Look, you know if we're talking about improving health care, that does not mean 11 new taxes. That does not mean 159 new government agencies or bureaucracies. It does not mean 16,000 new IRS agents.

""And I'm waiting for someone to explain to me what does government control of college education loans have to do with health care, which was part of that law. So there are some things that we need to carefully examine and we need to come up with a right, free market, free enterprise-based solution that looks at the cost analysis of health care and not just a simple government expansion.""

For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to know what West was referring to about ""an amendment in the health care law that said the federal government is going to take over education."" And is he right about a takeover?

""Takeover"" is a hot-button word

But first, some background from PolitiFact about that other big alleged ""government takeover:""

PolitiFact editors and reporters -- as well as readers -- chose ""government takeover of health care"" as the Lie of the Year for 2010. According to a PolitiFact article published Dec. 16, 2010, ""a 'Government Takeover' conjures a European approach where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees. But the law Congress passed, parts of which have already gone into effect, relies largely on the free market.""

Employers will still provide insurance through private companies, the government did not nationalize doctors or seize hospitals, and ultimately there was no public option -- a proposed government-run plan.

With that reminder of the health care takeover myth, let's return to West's claim about the federal government taking over education.

On Jan. 6, we contacted West spokeswoman Angela Sachitano and asked her to explain what amendment West was referring to and how it constituted an education takeover.

Health care link to student loans

We also did some research to look for a connection between government control of college education loans and the 2010 health care bill. We found some background from updates posted March 6, 2009, and April 5, 2010, on the Obameter, PolitiFact's website tracking promises made by President Barack Obama. The promise Obama had made was to ""eliminate wasteful subsidies to private student lenders, which will save nearly $6 billion dollars per year, and invest the savings in additional student aid.""

The Obameter wrote in 2009:

""There are basically two kinds of college loan programs: the Federal Family Education Loan Program, in which private lenders make and secure loans to students and receive subsidies from the federal government, and the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, in which the federal government directly loans to students. Obama's plan is to shift student lending away from the private loans to the government's direct loan program, which he believes is more efficient and cost-effective.""

On April 5, 2010, the Obameter wrote: ""Congress ultimately decided against cutting the program through the 2010 budget bill, but it was more forthcoming the second time around. On March 30, 2010, Obama signed legislation -- which was part of the health care bill -- that replaces the private lending program with 100 percent direct lending, effective July 1, 2010.""

In addition to the two updates on the Obameter, PolitiFact's Truth-O-Meter on April 21, 2010, summarized the cost savings of the change in the student loans:

""The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the fiscal impact of legislation, has said the student-lending changes will save the government nearly $61 billion in the 10-year period. The office estimates that of those savings, $36 billion will go to Pell grants, $2.2 billion to assist colleges historically serving blacks or other minorities, and $750 million to other college-access grants.""

The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which Obama signed into law March 30, 2010, included a portion on ""Student Loan Reform"" -- read the Congressional Research Service Summary to learn more about that portion of the bill.

On Jan. 7, Sachitano sent us a copy of a March 21, 2010, New York Times article about the House voting to revamp the student loan program as part of the reconciliation bill that included the health care law. Nothing in the article suggests that the move was a federal government ""takeover"" of education. The article did state that: ""Private banks lobbied against the student loan changes, which eliminate a long-flowing source of revenue for them.""

Higher ed experts weigh in

We spoke with three experts on higher education and all concluded that the changes in the loan program did not constitute the federal government taking over education. We spoke to Terry Hartle, vice president of the division of government and public affairs at the American Council on Education; Barry Toiv, vice president for public affairs at the Association of American Universities; and Stephanie Brown, associate vice president for enrollment and student services at Nova Southeastern University in Broward County. Part of West's Congressional District 22 lies in Broward.

Hartle gave us more history of the federal student loan program. When that program started in 1965, banks provided student loans that were guaranteed by the federal government. In 1993, then-President Bill Clinton said it didn't make sense for the government to subsidize banks to make loans to students and it would be better for the government to make loans directly to students. Congress didn't want to do away with the loan program involving private banks but did agree to add a direct federal loan program. Two programs co-existed for many years -- until the reconciliation act in 2010.

""Very few students will notice any difference in their loans because of the change,"" Hartle said. ""They are filling out the same loan application -- it just goes to a different post office box. The loan -- once it is made -- is not held by SunTrust, CitiBank or Bank of America; the loan is held by the U.S. Department of Education. The Department of Education will hire contractors who might be Bank of America, CitiBank or SuntTrust to manage the portfolio of loans. It's much cheaper for the Department of Education to make student loans this way than to make it through the banks.""

Colleges will notice some differences -- the financial aid employees are now dealing with the federal Department of Education rather than several banks.

""From campus officials I've talked to, it's not that big a difference,"" Hartle said. ""The vast majority of college presidents I talk to said it makes no difference to them, they didn't incur significantly higher costs ... and frankly the implementation was remarkably smooth.""

Said Toiv, of AAU and a former deputy press secretary under President Clinton, in an interview Jan. 7:

The change to the loan programs ""didn't take banks out of the program completely because the private sector still administers the loans for the Department of Education. However it did take out the part of the program where banks were the actual lenders. Opponents of this did refer to it as a federal 'takeover' of student lending. The proponents did not refer to it that way mainly because it's always been a federal program.""

While this changed work responsibilities for some employees in financial aid offices at universities, ""This has no impact at all on the management of colleges and universities,"" Toiv said.

Brown, at Nova, agreed in a Jan. 7 interview, saying it's not a takeover and the process is actually simpler for students who don't have to research multiple lenders anymore.

We sent Sachitano an e-mail Jan. 7 to tell her that our experts did not describe this as a government takeover and to ask whether she had additional proof to back up West's claim. She replied: ""No, we're good.""

Our ruling

Has the government seized control of education?

West said: ""We had an amendment in the health care law that said the federal government is going to take over education."" This is the same type of overblown ""takeover"" rhetoric that led to our 2010 Lie of the Year award. The federal government was a major player in student loans for years before Obama signed the health care law. And the law does not mean that colleges and universities are now under the control or management of the federal government. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097024780>],/factchecks/2011/jan/11/allen-west/west-says-feds-are-going-take-over-education/
"['National', 'Education', 'Chain email']","
Do members of Congress have to pay back student loans? Yes.
","
The latest chain e-mail we've received could be a new classic of the genre: Congress gets special perks nobody else does, a complacent media ignores the news (well, except for Fox News) and a request to forward it on to 20 people.

Here's the text:

""Monday on Fox news they learned that the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans. This will get national attention if other news networks will broadcast it. When you add this to the (items)  below, just where will all of it stop?""

The e-mail then includes a list of other purported examples of Congress giving itself special treatment, such as paying members for life, exempting members from sexual harassment laws, and leaving themselves out of ""the Healthcare Reform... In all of its forms."" Not one of these claims is accurate.

The student loan claim, though, was a new one for us. We decided to see if it could possibly be true.

The e-mail says that ""the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans."" It's confusingly worded, but we're going to assume the person meant relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers.

We contacted the U.S. Department of Education, which informed us that these groups are not exempt from paying back student loans. They have to pay back their loans like everyone else.

""There are no provisions under Title IV (federal student aid programs) that provide loan forgiveness for Members of Congress or their families or staff (beyond what any other borrower would be eligible for),"" said Jane Glickman, a spokesperson for the department, in an e-mail statement.

We wondered if the confusion arose because there are federal programs that help a small number of government workers pay back their student loans. It's called the Federal Student Loan Repayment Program, and it's meant to improve recruitment and retention. If a federal agency really wants to hire someone, it can offer to help pay the prospective employee's student loans. In exchange, the employee agrees to work for the agency for a minimum of three years. The payments are considered a form of income, and the worker pays taxes on them.

The program is fairly small: In 2010, the government repaid student loans for 8,454 employees. This compares with a total federal civilian workforce of about 2.7 million. According to government statistics, the program is used mostly by the U.S. Justice Department, the Defense Department, the State Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Health and Human Services. Congressional staffers are eligible for a similar assistance. But members, their spouses and their dependent children are not eligible for the program, said Dan Weiser, a spokesman with the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer for the U.S. House of Representatives.

We should emphasize that there's an enormous difference between an individual competing for and receiving a job offer that includes student loan payments as a benefit and an across-the-board exemption for people in power. The chain e-mail seems to have no conception of that.

Still, it wasn't that long ago that Congress did exempt itself from laws that other people had to follow. In 1995, Congress passed the Congressional Accountability Act, which applied 13 laws to members that hadn't applied previously. Several of the laws involved discrimination in the workplace, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.

Getting back to the question at hand, though: The chain e-mail said that members of Congress, their families and staff members do not have to repay student loans. This is ridiculously false. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772CA40>],/factchecks/2011/jan/11/chain-email/do-members-congress-have-pay-back-student-loans-ye/
"['National', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Pundits', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Guns', 'Pierre Thomas']","
""This Week"" report says hundreds have died in multiple-victim shootings
","On Jan 9, 2011, ABC News' This Week with Christiane Amanpour aired a special edition from Tucson, Ariz., the site of a bloody attack on a public meeting called by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., that left at least six dead, including a federal judge, an aide to Giffords and a nine-year-old girl. Another 14 were wounded, including Giffords, who is in critical condition after being shot through the head. A local 22-year-old, Jared Lee Loughner, has been charged.

In a report, ABC News senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas tried to put the attack into context. ""Saturday's shootings reflect a disturbing trend,"" Thomas said. ""Mass shootings have become commonplace since the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007,"" in which a single gunman killed 32 and wounded many more. ""There have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded. Hundreds have died.""

We wondered if mass shootings have indeed been that common in recent years.

We looked through some of the major criminal-justice statistical sources, including the FBI's Uniform Crime Report and the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Study, but initially we failed to find any published statistics on mass shootings. We eventually reached James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, who said he had worked on his own with raw FBI statistics over many years and had the numbers to put the claim to the test.

For the years relevant to Thomas' statement, here are the number of incidents in the United States in which four or more died in shooting incidents, according to Fox's calculations. (Criminologists told us that the usual cut-off in these type of statistical studies is four victims rather than three.)

• 2007: 23
• 2008: 29
• 2009: 27

So, with a three-year total of 79 such incidents, it's clear that describing it as ""dozens of incidents"" is accurate. And the number of incidents with at least three victims would be even higher -- perhaps as many as five times as high. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 0.12 percent of homicides in 2005 involved four victims while 0.60 percent of homicides involved three victims. If those ratios remain more or less constant over time, then there are about five times as many three-victim homicides as four-victim homicides.

Now, what about the suggestion that ""hundreds"" of people die in such incidents? That, too, appears to be accurate. Using just the baseline of four dead per incident, the numbers killed in mass shootings in 2007, 2008 and 2009, would be 316, according to Fox's tabulations. If the threshold is raised to shootings involving three victims, the death toll could be roughly 1,600.

So these facts are correct. However, Thomas' statement lacks some important context.

First, Thomas suggested that there was a ""disturbing trend,"" which we interpret to mean a steady increase. But if you look at Thomas' three-year period, the number did rise from 23 to 29 between 2007 and 2008, then fell from 29 to 27 from 2008 to 2009. That's not a trend; it's more like what the experts call ""statistical noise.""

While Thomas didn't refer to trends over a longer period than just three years, the numbers for the longer term are murky as well. To more easily analyze Fox's data -- which goes back to 1976 -- we averaged the number of incidents for each five-year period (or, in the case of 2006 to 2009, a four-year period). Here are the results:

• 1976-1980: 20.6 incidents annually
• 1981-1985: 16.8
• 1986-1990: 18.2
• 1991-1995: 23.0
• 1996-2000: 20.0
• 2001-2005: 21.0
• 2006-2009: 25.5

The numbers do show a rise over the final three periods, but over the course of 34 years, the trendline shows peaks and valleys. Viewed over 34 years, the direction is not exactly clear.

""It would be misleading to suggest that there was some long-term upward trend in mass shootings since 1976,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. ""The exact number are highly unstable, but ignoring small, year-to-year fluctuations, there was no trend one way or the other from 1976 to 2009. Further, if these figures were computed on a per-capita basis, taking into account population increases, the long-term trend in the rate would be downward.""

Second, Thomas used the word ""commonplace"" to describe multiple-victim homicides. ""Commonplace"" is a subjective term, and clearly, even a single multiple homicide is a tragedy. However, the term ""commonplace"" seems a bit too strong in this context.

As mentioned earlier, the Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers showed that in 2005, 0.60 percent of all homicide incidents involved 3 victims, and 0.12 percent -- or one of every 1,000 homicides -- involved four victims. Despite the heartache involved, those are, in the big picture, pretty modest numbers.

""Murders are not 'commonplace' in the first place, and mass killings are even less common,"" said Christine E. Rasche, an emeritus criminologist at the University of North Florida. ""We are more likely to hear about them today because of a much more ubiquitous media which quickly brings us news from all over the world. In the past, we were more likely to hear only about local events.""

So let's recap. Thomas was correct to say that ""there have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded,"" and he was also correct that ""hundreds have died"" in such incidents. But its a stretch to say that killings of three or more people are now ""commonplace,"" and it's not clear that there's been a distinct trend upward, either since 2007 (as Thomas put it) or over the past three decades. So we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973FB6C0>],/factchecks/2011/jan/11/pierre-thomas/week-report-says-hundreds-have-died-multiple-victi/

Reflecting on his tenure as Wisconsin’s second-longest-serving governor, Democrat Jim Doyle was asked about a ""dust-up"" between Wisconsin Republicans and state employee unions.

Republicans, in the days leading up to the Dec. 19, 2010 interview, had talked of restricting the unions’ power and making Wisconsin a ""right-to-work"" state.

""Well, that’s serious,"" Doyle said on WISN-TV’s ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a Milwaukee public affairs program. Then he added:

""I’ve made deeper cuts than any governor’s ever made and I’ve had to impose tougher cost controls on state employees than anybody’s made.""

The second claim made us wonder: Was Doyle, who served eight years, tougher than every previous Wisconsin governor when it comes to ""cost controls"" on state employees?

After all, it’s been more than 162 years since 35-year-old Nelson Dewey was elected the state’s first governor in 1848.

It isn’t possible, of course, to closely examine the administrations of all 43 of Doyle’s predecessors, and the size and scope of state government has changed so much that cross-generational comparisons may not be valid. But statistics and interviews with experts provided a solid picture of the past 40 years.

There are two things to keep in mind about that period:

First, with the Great Recession, Doyle’s tenure coincided with worst economic period of those 40 years, which prompted many of the actions he took.

Second, the period does not include the Great Depression, when the state also took some very stark actions to curtail costs.

We started with Doyle, asking his aides to provide support for the claim that he took stronger steps than any other governor. Just before turning the office over to Republican Scott Walker on Jan. 3, aides cited five areas in which Doyle cut or curtailed expenditures for state employees.

They made no effort to compare him to previous administrations.

The areas:

Wages

Doyle spokesman Adam Collins said Doyle kept pay raises low throughout his two terms and, in the 2007-2009 state budget, saved $62 million by rescinding 2 percent raises for non-union employees.

We asked the Office of State Employment Relations for figures as far back as it could go. Under Doyle, raises averaged 1.21 percent per year -- less than under the previous four elected governors dating back to 1971.

The raises under those governors: Republican Tommy Thompson, the longest-serving governor (1987-2001), 1.79 percent; Democrat Anthony Earl (1983-1987), 3.96 percent; Republican Lee Dreyfus (1979-1983), 8.5 percent; and Democrat Patrick Lucey (1971-1977), 6.91 percent.

Health insurance

Collins said changes made in 2005 raised premiums for employees who were already paying them and required premium payments from employees who weren’t paying any.

We sought details from the Department of Employee Trust Funds, which said the portion of premiums paid by employees more than doubled under Doyle, from 2.5 percent in 2003 to 5.6 percent in 2011.

Pensions

Collins said the vast majority of state employees paid nothing toward their pensions until January 2011, when they were required to contribute 0.2 percent -- two-tenths of 1 percent -- of their pay.

Bob Conlin, deputy secretary of the Department of Employee Trust Funds, told us the change applies to about 90 percent of employees and is estimated to save the state more than $6.6 million per year in pension contributions.

Furloughs

Collins pointed out that Doyle required employees to take eight unpaid furlough days in both the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 budget years, saving an estimated $208 million over the two-year period.

The furloughs amounted to a 3 percent pay cut.

Unfilled jobs

Collins said that over 10 percent of the 33,000 positions authorized by the Legislature (not including the University of Wisconsin System) were vacant when Doyle left office.

So that is the case made by Doyle.

He took office facing an estimated $3.2 billion deficit, pledging to trim 10,000 state jobs -- a promise he did not deliver on. He left office with the state, and his successor, facing a comparable deficit.

For perspective, we turned to five experts to see how Doyle compares. We also asked them if measures other than those cited by Doyle should be taken into consideration in terms of employee cost controls.

Three experts said Doyle controlled employee costs more than any previous governor for at least the past 40 years:

Edward Miller, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point political science professor. He said  Dreyfus rescinded raises, Earl provided no raises during his first in year office and various governors imposed hiring freezes, but overall Doyle did more employee cost controls than any governor since at least 1970.

Mordecai Lee, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor of governmental affairs. He said no governor has imposed more significant employee cost controls than Doyle since at least 1970. Lee is a former Democratic state lawmaker.

Dennis Dresang, University of Wisconsin-Madison public affairs and political science professor emeritus: While Doyle didn’t resort to layoffs, as Wisconsin governors during the Great Depression and other periods did, he ""certainly is someone who saw (employee) costs as a place for getting savings in the budget.""

Dresang and others did not have a trove of information about the Great Depression.

The state Historical Society pointed us to the state Bureau of Personnel’s biennial report for 1932-1934, early in the Great Depression. It showed state employees suffered pay cuts as high as 25 percent.

The other two other experts we consulted were George Lightbourn, president of the conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute and secretary of the Department of Administration under Thompson and McCallum; and University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh public affairs professor Craig Maher, an expert in state government finance.

Neither cited another Wisconsin governor who did tougher employee cost controls than Doyle.

But they said Doyle’s actions should be compared not to prior Wisconsin governors, but to U.S. governors who served when he did, given that they were confronted by the worst economy since the Depression.

Maher noted a June 2010 study by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers. It found that, unlike Doyle, 26 governors ordered layoffs and nine cut employee benefits in the 2009-2010 budget year.

Let’s size things up.

Doyle said he did more than any previous Wisconsin governor in controlling state employee costs. Doyle did limit pay raises, make some pay cuts and make employees pay more for benefits.

It’s difficult to do a valid governor-by-governor comparison across the generations, so based on available statistics and consulting with experts, we went back 40 years. For that time frame, experts agreed Doyle’s claim was correct for that period -- but noted his actions were largely a product of the time during which he served.

We rate Doyle’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097218E00>],/factchecks/2011/jan/11/jim-doyle/former-wisconsin-gov-jim-doyle-says-he-imposed-tou/
"['Elections', 'PunditFact', 'Matthew Dowd']","
Has President Obama 'lost' more Democratic seats in Congress than other modern presidents?
","The Democrats took their final drubbing of the 2014 midterm election Dec. 6 with the decisive defeat of Sen. Mary Landrieu in the Louisiana Senate runoff. The election of U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy means Republicans will hold 54 seats in the new Senate. Assessing the Democratic plight, one-time Republican consultant turned news analyst Matthew Dowd said President Barack Obama had overseen historic losses for his party. ""President Obama has demonstrated he’s very good at winning his own elections,"" Dowd said on ABC’s This Week on Dec. 7, 2014. ""But in modern times, he has lost more members of the House and more members of the Senate than any president ever has lost."" We asked Dowd what he meant by modern times and he told PunditFact he was thinking of post-World War II. We went to the congressional records to see how this president and his party stack up compared to past administrations. We decided to look at how many seats for the own president's party, be it Democrat or Republican, shifted during each president's time in office.  We ran the numbers two ways. In the first approach, we looked at the electoral impact of a president who was running on his record. This meant we ignored party shifts in the year he was first elected because at that point he had no presidential track record. This meant that for two-term presidents, we summed the changes for the first midterm, the re-election, and the second midterm. We scored single-term presidents for just one midterm. In the second approach, we allowed for a presidential coattail effect. If the president’s name was on the ballot, we counted any party shifts, including those in the year he was first elected. So for all presidents, we summed the changes from his first election to his last midterm. We treated Presidents Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford a little differently because they took office when their president died or resigned. We counted their first election, if they won, as a case of running on their record and added in any shifts in the balance of congressional party power. Here’s what we came up with. President President's party shift in Congress (Without first election) President's party shift in Congress (Including first election) Franklin Roosevelt (D) -71 seats +38 seat Harry Truman (D) -17 seats -17 seats Dwight Eisenhower (R) -83 seats -60 seats John F. Kennedy (D) -2 seats -22 seats Lyndon Johnson (D) -14 seats -14 seats Richard Nixon (R) -1 seats 11 seats Gerald Ford (R) -54 seats -54 seats Jimmy Carter (D) -16 seats -16 seats Ronald Reagan (R) -24 seats +24 seats George H.W. Bush (R) -7 seats -10 seats Bill Clinton (D) -59 seats -67 seats George W. Bush (R) -18 seats -26 seats Barack Obama (D) -85 seats -52 seats   The table makes it clear that the first election makes a big difference. Without it, Dowd is correct, though just narrowly. Obama saw his party lose a total of 85 seats between the House and the Senate in the course of three elections. Interestingly, President Dwight Eisenhower runs a close second with 83 fewer Republicans. These are net numbers so ground lost in one election could be made up in the next. For Eisenhower, 1958 was the worst year. For Obama, it was 2010. However, when we include every year when the president’s name appeared on the ballot, the ranking shifts. Obama first took office in a wave election that cost Republicans quite a bit. When we run the numbers this way, President Bill Clinton comes in as first among losers, followed by Eisenhower and Ford. Obama takes fourth place. To viewers, it wasn’t clear what yardstick Dowd was using. While he noted that Obama was good at winning his own elections, he didn’t specifically set a timeframe for measuring how the balance of power in Congress has shifted over time. We think both measures are largely valid. One argument for giving more weight to the first approach is Dowd was talking about the effect that presidents have on their party. Until you win election, you aren’t president, and the gains or losses in your first election shouldn’t count. We should also highlight that no president deserves full credit or blame for party gains or losses. To say that Obama has lost members of his party in Congress is not to say that he alone made that happen. (A technical note: We used the official party counts by the House of Representatives and the Senate. They record the numbers at the start of each Congress. If members die, resign or switch parties during their term, we don’t include those changes. Also, we did not include independents or members of other parties who would then choose to caucus with one of the major parties.) Our ruling Dowd said Obama has lost more seats held by his party in the House and Senate than any modern president. By one valid measure, Dowd is correct. By another measure, Obama would rank fourth. That, however, does not make Dowd’s claim inaccurate. It just means that it needs clarification and some additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097212BC0>],/factchecks/2014/dec/07/matthew-dowd/has-president-obama-lost-more-democratic-seats-con/

Brown U. student leader: More African-American men in prison system now than were enslaved in 1850
","A Brown University student leader offered a provocative historical comparison at the beginning of a Nov. 18, 2014, forum on the efficacy of taxing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island. ""There are more African-American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850,"" said Diego Arene-Morley, president of Brown University Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Arene-Morley made the statement to highlight that African-American and Hispanic men are arrested at disproportionate rates under the current drug laws. We wondered whether Arene-Morley got his numbers right, so we asked him what he based his statement on.  We also reached out to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and the national nonprofit advocacy group, The Sentencing Project, for current figures. And we contacted the U.S. Census Bureau and the Rhode Island Historical Society for data about slavery in 1850. The Census of 1850 showed that 872,924 male African-American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time. (The same Census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African-American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total U.S. population, including slaves and ""free coloreds,"" was 23.2 million.) How does that compare with the number of African-American men now under some sort of judicial system supervision? According to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 526,000 African-American men serving time in state or federal correctional facilities in 2013. (That’s 37 percent of the overall 1.5 million imprisoned men.) That represented almost 3 percent of the overall black male population in the United States, compared with .5 percent of white males, according to the bureau. There were 877,000 African-American men on probation in 2013, according to the bureau. And there were 280,000 African-American male parolees. (Probation is part of a criminal sentence that allows an offender to remain under supervision in the community instead of jail. Parole is the supervised release of an inmate from jail before his or her official release date.) In total, there were about 1.68 million African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African-American men who were enslaved in 1850. Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, provided a somewhat higher estimate for the number of African-American men now imprisoned or on probation and parole. His number, which includes those serving time in local jails, was about 1.88 million, more than 1 million above the 1850 figure. For the Rhode Island perspective, we asked the state Department of Corrections for its numbers. As of Oct. 10, there were 932 African-American men sentenced or awaiting trial in Rhode Island out of 3,108 male inmates overall. In addition, 4,285 African-American men were on probation; 87 on parole; and 4 are on lifetime supervision, according to spokeswoman Susan Lamkins. That totals 5,308, or 11 percent of the 48,542 black or African-American men in Rhode Island 18 years or older, according to the Census estimates as of July 1, 2013. When Arene-Morley got back to us, he referred us to the book ""The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness"" by Michelle Alexander and to an interview with Alexander featured on the Huffington Post website. The Huffington Post piece attributes to Alexander a statement the more black men are behind bars or under the watch of the criminal justice system than there were enslaved in 1850. Our ruling  Arene-Morley said that ""There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850."" Our research found that U.S. Bureau of Criminal Statistics put the number of African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013 at about 1.68 million -- 807,076 above the number of African American men enslaved in 1850. The Sentencing Project, too, puts that number at 1.88 million with local jails factored in. Given that evidence, we rate Arene-Morley’s claim True.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Mike Dudgeon']","
Lawmaker on target about superintendents
","Georgia voters have twice refused to amend the state constitution to allow for an appointed -- rather than elected -- state school superintendent. But those votes took place roughly 30 years ago (1984 and 1988), and that old idea could have new legs if state Rep. Mike Dudgeon, a Republican from Johns Creek, has his way. On the eve of last month’s general election, Dudgeon announced on Facebook that he would be pushing a similar constitutional amendment in the General Assembly session that starts in January. ""This is not about who is or is not elected to the position tomorrow but about governance,"" he wrote on Facebook. In 38 states, the state school superintendent is appointed by either the governor or the state school board, Dudgeon said in an interview published Nov. 18. It only makes sense that Georgia would follow the other states’ lead, he said. PolitiFact decided Dudgeon’s claim merited a closer look. First, a little background about the job of state school superintendent. In Georgia, it’s an elected position paying $127,000 a year with largely administrative duties -- mainly running the state Department of Education, which has 786 employees and a $9.6 billion annual budget. The superintendent also carries out policies set by lawmakers, the governor and the members of the state Board of Education who are appointed by the governor from the state’s 14 congressional districts. Some of the more recent superintendents have made headlines, including Linda Schrenko, who went to prison for stealing federal funds, some of which she spent on a facelift; and Kathy Cox, who proposed striking the word ""evolution"" from the state science curriculum. Cox was back in the headlines in 2008 as a $1 million winner on the popular game show ""Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader?"" She promised her winnings to schools for the disabled, but creditors in a bankruptcy related to her husband’s failed home construction business had other ideas. John Barge, the current Republican superintendent, sparred with Gov. Nathan Deal over a constitutional amendment on charter schools, then ran unsuccessfully against him. Barge made a rare cross-party endorsement of Democrat Valarie Wilson, who lost this year’s superintendent’s race to Richard Woods, a Republican and retired South Georgia teacher and school administrator. Dudgeon’s proposed constitutional amendment would not affect Woods. It would require approval of two-thirds of the state House and Senate and could not go before voters until 2016, Dudgeon told PolitiFact. But do most states really have appointed state superintendents? And is Georgia really in the minority with an elected one? We reached out to the Council of Chief State School Officers and the Education Commission of the States, two groups that keep such data. Their records show 37 states with appointed superintendents and 13 states with elected superintendents, including Georgia and Wyoming. Wyoming was not counted in an ECS PowerPoint that Dudgeon relied on from earlier in the year that’s recently been updated, ECS staff told us. Wyoming is currently debating whether to move from an appointed to an elected superintendent. The outgoing superintendent there was threatened with impeachment and lawsuits and removed last year, though her duties were later reinstated by the state Supreme Court, according to news accounts. Dudgeon said Georgia’s current system, with an elected state superintendent and an appointed state school board, doesn’t make sense. ""We are electing an administrator and appointing the people (the state school board) who make the policy,"" he said. That’s opposite the way it normally works, Dudgeon said. His constitutional amendment would change the method for selecting state school board members, though the specifics are still being developed. ""My preference is that they not all be appointed by the governor,"" Dudgeon said. A similar constitutional amendment was filed but not pursued in the General Assembly in 2001 by Phil Gingrey, then a state senator and now a member of the U.S. House. Georgia’s local school districts were traditionally run by elected superintendents, but that changed as of 1996. The Georgia School Boards Association is on record in support of an appointed state superintendent and nonpartisan state board with one member elected from each of the state’s 14 congressional districts. Our ruling: Dudgeon’s on target with his claim that the vast majority of states have an appointed state school superintendent. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096ECEDC0>],/factchecks/2014/dec/06/mike-dudgeon/lawmaker-target-about-superintendents/
"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Alberta Darling']","
Alberta Darling says reading proficiency is 8% at 50 low-income and high-minority schools
","Studies have long documented the lagging reading performance of Milwaukee students compared with pupils statewide. Now, some officials are spotlighting poor results at a subset of Milwaukee schools -- those serving very high concentrations of African-Americans from lower-income households. ""We can’t turn our backs on these children anymore,"" state Sen. Alberta Darling told radio talker Brian Schimming on Dec. 2, 2014. ""There’s a report out about the crisis in Milwaukee, the lack of access to high quality education."" Darling, a Republican from River Hills in Milwaukee’s northern suburbs, focused on schools in which at least 80 percent of students are low-income and 80 percent are black. ""There are 50 of these schools in Milwaukee, and their reading proficiency on the statewide test is 8 percent. Eight percent! It’s shockingly low."" Darling’s remarks on WISN-AM (1130) radio came as she again endorsed legislation forcing Milwaukee Public Schools to sell more vacant schools at a time when such facilities are sought by competing private schools that participate in the taxpayer-funded Milwaukee school voucher program. But, it is important to note, her comments did not single out public schools. Is Darling right? Examining the claim Darling’s office told us she got the numbers from an education newsletter published in 2014 by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. That newsletter says the reading proficiency was ""below 8%"" at the selected schools. The MMAC, it turns out, drew the number from research done by Henry Tyson, superintendent of St. Marcus Lutheran School, a major participant in the Milwaukee voucher program. The school has tried unsuccessfully to buy school buildings from MPS to expand. Tyson’s research focused on about 50 schools that, like St. Marcus, offer kindergarten through eighth grade. Darling’s comments didn’t specify a certain type of school. So we did our own look at reading scores at all Milwaukee schools fitting the 80/80 description, including high schools and separate elementary and middle schools that include smaller groupings of grades. Our main data source: the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. Why are officials focusing on these schools at all? High-poverty schools tend to have lower achievement than low-poverty schools. Milwaukee's highest-poverty schools serve racial minorities. Milwaukee's black students post some of the lowest achievement scores nationally among black students nationwide in certain grades and subjects. To the numbers Under Tyson’s approach, the K-8 schools, we found 57 that met the criteria. Their average schoolwide reading proficiency score: 7.9 percent. In the broader pool of schools, which tallied 95 schools, the average was 7.3 percent. So the 8 percent claim is on target. Of course, this is the reading average based on the collective reading proficiency at each school. It doesn’t mean every school came in at the overall school average of 7.3 percent. Five schools, for example, had not a single pupil score proficient in reading on the state tests, which are administered to students in third through eighth grades, and once in high school, in 10th grade. The state assigned those schools a 0 percent score. On the other end of the scale, the best reading proficiency score at an 80/80 school was 21 percent at Hartford Avenue University School in MPS. Second (20 percent) was Franklin School, also in MPS. St. Marcus Lutheran was third (19 percent). Let’s put the overall 7 percent reading proficiency into a broader context. Across MPS, for all students and all schools, about 15 percent of students scored proficient in reading on the fall 2013 state assessments, about twice as high as the score at the schools Darling mentioned. Across Wisconsin, 36.6 percent of students scored proficient or better in reading that year, though just 21 percent of economically disadvantaged students met that bar. Among the state's black students, 14 percent scored at least proficient in reading. Interactive table: A look at the schools and how they fare It is important to note that the scores are so low, in part, due to the state raising the bar for what's considered a proficient score on the state test. Another data note: reading results for private schools are based on their publicly funded students, not their private payers or scholarship students. Results by school type We broke out reading results for public schools in MPS, private schools in the choice program, and independent charter schools. The small number of charter schools scored somewhat better that the rest as a group, with a 10.3 percent average proficiency. Next was MPS (7.8 percent) followed by the choice schools (6.2 percent). The bottom-10 schools included seven choice schools and three from MPS. The 10 at the top included five from MPS, four voucher schools (all Lutheran) and one independent charter. Our rating Darling said that at the 50 Milwaukee schools serving ""at least 80% African-American and at least 80% low income"" students,"" the reading proficiency is 8%. That’s accurate to within a few tenths of a percentage point, under the state’s tougher new grading scale.

Gwen Moore says Obamacare created lowest-ever inflation in health care costs
","A week after the mid-term elections, in which the GOP gained considerable ground in Congress, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore was asked if Americans had rejected President Barack Obama’s policies. The Milwaukee Democrat responded, in part, by saying Republicans had take many steps to ""discredit"" Obama, including voting more than 50 times to repeal his Affordable Care Act. ""But the reality,"" Moore stated Nov. 11, 2014 on Wisconsin Public Radio, ""is that Obamacare has lowered health care costs by $36 billion just this year. We've had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare."" The bolder claim about Obamacare -- that health care inflation in the United States is the lowest ever because of the law -- is one we want to check. Inflation vs. spending Health care inflation and health care spending are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are different. Inflation refers to health care prices from one year to the next, while spending is, well, how much is spent on health care. It turns out that growth in both health care inflation and expenditures are at historic lows, at least dating back to when the federal government began tracking them in 1960. Moore’s office cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that shows health care inflation, as of the end of 2013, at about 1 percent per year -- the lowest since the early 1960s. Some economists prefer to consider actual health care expenditures, since that goes to how much health care is being used and how much is being paid for it. The latest estimates from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services put health care spending at $2.8 trillion, or $8,915 per person, in 2012. That marked the fourth straight year, dating back to 2009, that the annual increase was less than 4 percent. Again, those are historic lows dating back to 1960. (A few weeks after Moore made her claim, the 2013 figure was released, showing health expenditures rose 3.6 percent, the lowest annual increase since 1960.) So, Moore is on the right track in terms of the figures. But the thrust of her claim is that the inflation slowdown is due to Obamacare. Moore spokesman Eric Harris argued that Moore didn’t claim Obamacare is the sole cause of the slowdown in health care prices, although she believes it is an important one. But Moore made her statement while defending the law and clearly gave it singular credit for the smaller increases in medical inflation. Obamacare’s role There is not widespread agreement that the Affordable Care Act is the key factor in limiting medical inflation. The inflation rates are lowest since the law took effect in March 2010, though they were trending downward several years earlier and the law has been rolled out only in stages. Even the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, in a November 2013 report, said ""the causes of the slowdown are not yet fully understood"" -- although it gave some credit to Obamacare, including the law’s reduction in Medicare payments to health care providers. And the council’s chairman wrote in the Wall Street Journal that ""many factors, including the recession and one-time developments like blockbuster drugs coming off patent, have contributed to the slowdown,"" but that Obamacare ""has made a meaningful contribution."" We sought out some economists, as well. Harvard University’s David Cutler, who served as the senior health care adviser to Obama’s 2008 campaign, told us ""nobody has the complete answer"" for the smaller increases in health care inflation but that Obamacare is ""important."" Others downplayed the role of the health care reform law. Charles Roehrig, director of the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at the nonprofit Altarum Institute, noted that Obamacare’s main aim is to expand health insurance coverage, not reduce prices. It is a factor in healthcare inflation, but the smaller increases in health prices are ""mainly explained by slower overall price inflation,"" he said. And like other economists, Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told us much of the slowing in medical-price inflation is simply due to the ""unusually slow recovery from the recession."" The Affordable Act, she said, has had perhaps a ""small effect."" Finally, the Washington Post Fact Checker arrived at a similar conclusion in rating a November 2014 claim by Obama that health care inflation ""has gone down every single year"" since the Affordable Care Act passed. The president, though he wasn’t as bold as Moore, was given ""three pinocchios"" for a statement that has ""significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions."" ""There are certainly some cost-controls contained in the law, but it remains unclear whether those measures have really had that much impact, especially because the Great Recession clearly had affected health-care inflation even before the law was implemented,"" The Fact Checker wrote. ""Just as growth in health-care costs have slowed because the 2009 economic crisis, so has economic growth and general price inflation overall."" Our rating Moore said: ""We've had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare."" There’s an element of truth in her claim, given that the Affordable Care Act is given some credit for the smallest increases in health care inflation on record. But Moore’s claim gave virtually all the credit to Obamacare, when there isn’t evidence it played that large of a role. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACBC40>],/factchecks/2014/dec/05/gwen-moore/gwen-moore-says-obamacare-created-lowest-ever-infl/

Bernie Sanders says U.S. was 1st in college degrees in 1990, but now ranks 12th in world
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has toyed with running for president in 2016, is a member of Congress who loves to share statistical claims on social media. Sometimes it’s on Twitter; other times it’s in memes tailored for Facebook. A reader recently sent us a new meme featuring an image of the populist senator alongside a claim he made about higher education. It said: ""Forty years ago, some of our great public universities, as well as many state colleges, were virtually tuition free. Today, the cost of college is unaffordable for many. In 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees. Today we are in 12th place. Things need to change. Higher education must become affordable for all."" We decided to see whether Sanders was right that the United States led the world in 1990 for young people with college degrees but now ranks 12th internationally. Checking the second part of the claim -- that the United States is currently in 12th place -- is pretty straightforward. It’s confirmed by statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations. For 2012 -- the last year for which statistics are available -- there were 11 countries with higher rates of college education. According to OECD, the countries ranking higher than the United States were South Korea, Japan, Canada, Russia, Luxembourg, Ireland, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Norway. The top finisher, South Korea, had a rate more than 20 percentage points higher than the United States. We had more trouble finding data for 1990. When we asked Sanders’ staff for the source, they pointed us to a scholarly paper published by BBVA Research, titled, ""Educational Attainment in the OECD, 1960-2010."" In Table 14, the paper offers college attainment data for OECD countries for each five-year increment between 1960 and 2010. However, this measurement is not exactly the same one as used in 2014. It looks at attainment of the ""second cycle of higher education"" in each country, which isn't exactly the same as rates of receiving an undergraduate degree. So this data does not allow for an apples-to-apples comparison. The most direct comparison we could find was OECD data from 2000. That year, the United States ranked fourth after Canada, Japan and Finland. It’s worth noting that two of the countries ranking ahead of the United States in 2012 -- Russia and Israel -- were not surveyed in 2000. So their inclusion in the 2012 data slightly exaggerates the severity of the U.S. decline. Still, experts told PolitiFact that if you extrapolate back from the 2000 data to 1990, the United States was certainly among the highest ranks of countries in rates of college degrees. ""There could be some niceties to quibble with, but probably nothing that would make his statement wrong in any significant way,"" said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. ""The statement is generally accurate."" Bills and other experts did question whether there’s a straight-line link between high tuition and low degree rates, as Sanders argued. ""My guess -- and it’s mostly a guess -- is that students being academically underprepared leads to more noncompletion than tuition does,"" Bills said. Ben Wildavsky, director of higher education studies at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, concurred. ""The key thing to understand is that U.S. degree-attainment rates haven’t gotten worse – the rest of the world has gotten better,"" Wildavsky said. ""So this doesn’t particularly say anything about affordability, I think. But it’s reasonable to say that we need to increase degree production to meet the needs of the changing economy."" Our ruling Sanders said that ""in 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees. Today we are in 12th place."" There are some quirks in the data, but experts agree that the general trend line is roughly as Sanders says it is. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097135800>],/factchecks/2014/dec/05/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-us-was-1st-college-degrees-199/

Michael McCaul says Obama said 'over 20 times' he lacked authority to act alone on immigration
","Echoing the U.S. House speaker, Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin charged President Barack Obama with disregarding many of his own statements by declaring the government would stop deporting millions of unauthorized residents. At a Dec. 2, 2014, hearing, McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson: ""The president said over 20 times that he did not have the legal authority to do this, to take this executive action, and that this is not how democracy works. Do you agree with that prior statement?"" Johnson replied: ""Mr. Chairman, I know from 30 years as a lawyer that when someone paraphrases remarks from somebody, I want to see the full Q-and-A, I want to see the full context to know exactly what the person said. I have looked at various excerpts of remarks by the president concerning his legal authority to act. I do not believe that what we have done is inconsistent with that."" Shortly before Obama detailed his 2014 moves, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found False the Democratic president’s statement that his position hadn’t changed on using executive authority to address immigration. Notably, the administration in June 2012 demonstrated a willingness to apply its discretionary powers by issuing a ""deferred action"" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. The move potentially shielded hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30. Critics called the move an abuse of authority. Proponents said it was in keeping with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act providing a path to citizenship for children brought to the U.S. by immigrants not legally permitted to live here. So, Obama used to say his ability to take action ended at deferring action against children of unauthorized residents. But he lately has been saying there were additional things he could and would do. In his Nov. 20, 2014, announcement touching off Republican objections, Obama said he would delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If an applicant can pass a background check and pay a fee, he or she could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which is expected to open for applications this spring. It’s one thing for Obama to attempt revisionist history. But is McCaul right that the president previously forswore his authority to act – and more than 20 times? Boehner’s Obama breakdown By email, McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen pointed out a Nov. 19, 2014, blog post by the Republican House speaker, John Boehner, stating Obama had said 22 times he couldn’t ignore or create his own immigration law. We explored each of Boehner’s citations by establishing what Obama said from original source materials including transcripts and news stories. Upshot: About 15 of the tallied Obama statements suggest Obama didn’t think he had the power to do more on immigration by himself, hence backing up McCaul’s statement. We’ll summarize those statements in this story and greater detail lies in the document here. However, around half a dozen of Boehner’s examples showed Obama saying or hinting otherwise about his executive powers or not talking about his independent ability to affect immigrants. Times Obama was silent or signaled he did have power For instance, Boehner brought up two Obama statements from when he was running for president in 2008 and criticizing ""signing statements"" like ones employed by President George W. Bush to interpret legislation signed into law; neither of these items showed Obama bringing up immigration. On July 1, 2010, Obama laid out his hopes Congress would reach an immigration law overhaul. In his remarks, he recognized ""there are those in the immigrants’ rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are (here) illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. And often this argument is framed in moral terms: Why should we punish people who are just trying to earn a living?"" Obama said such an action would be ""unwise and unfair,"" but he didn’t address whether he thought he had the power to take such action. Boehner’s list also folded in Obama’s reply at an October 2010 MTV/BET event about his position on the military’s since-eclipsed policy of ""don’t ask, don’t tell."" ""I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there,"" Obama said. But immigration was not part of his reply while to another question, Obama stressed border security and otherwise urged a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws. Boehner also listed Obama’s remarks at an April 2011 event. In that instance, though, the president focused on his desire for bipartisan immigration reform – and didn’t speak explicitly to his executive powers. ""I can't solve this problem by myself,"" Obama said,adding: ""We're going to have to change the laws in Congress."" At a September 2011 White House roundtable, Obama was asked about granting ""administrative relief"" enabling students lacking legal residency to stay in the country. His answer seemed to indicate he saw wiggle room for the administration, which makes sense given the soon-to-debut deferred-action mandate. Obama initially said: ""I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true."" But, he went on, ""what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources."" In a July 2013 Univision interview, which we found excerpted in an NPR news story, Obama was asked if, in the event Congress failed to pass immigration legislation, he could use his power to give amnesty to the estimated 11 million unauthorized U.S. residents. His answer left wiggle room. ""Probably not,"" Obama replied. ""I think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus."" A more recent Obama quotation offered by Boehner seemingly contradicts McCaul’s statement. In August 2014, Obama indicated to reporters that he might have room to act on his own. In the face of no congressional movement on immigration legislation, Obama said, ""what I can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress. And we’re going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you the American people don’t want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done."" Times Obama said he couldn’t do more on immigration alone Let’s turn next to Obama statements, from Boehner’s list, that seem to support McCaul’s claim that Obama didn’t think he had independent legal authority to act on immigration -- some made before the deferred-action directive came out. In October 2010, Obama told Eddie ""Piolin"" Sotelo, a radio host on Spanish-speaking Univision, that he couldn’t achieve comprehensive immigration reform without congressional action. ""I am president, I am not king,"" Obama said. ""...I’m committed to making it happen, but I’ve got to have some partners to do it."" At a Univision event in March 2011, Obama was asked if he could stop deportations of students with an order. That’s ""just not the case,"" Obama said, ""because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed... Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws."" Simply issuing such an order, he said, ""would not conform with my appropriate role as president."" Yet he also hinted at wiggle room, saying: ""That does not mean, though, that we can't make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity. In an April 2011 speech in Miami and the next month in El Paso, Obama said he couldn’t bypass Congress and change immigration laws himself, saying that’s not how a democracy works. Addressing the National Council of La Raza in July 2011, Obama drew exhortations to act without waiting for congressional agreement. He called that idea ""tempting,"" then said ""that's not how our system works."" In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that ""as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,"" as in parents deported. At a presidential debate the next month, Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney were asked: ""What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?"" Obama said: ""I've done everything that I can on my own."" In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had aided law-abiding students. ""I’m not a king,"" Obama replied, tracking his response the same month to a similar query from Univision and his reply at a February 2013 Google Hangout town hall where he also said ""we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can."" The same year, Obama was asked by Telemundo if he would consider freezing deportations of the parents of students benefiting from the administration’s 2012 action. Obama replied that if he broadened his protective orders, ""then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option."" We confirmed similar hitches on Obama’s part in a November 2013 speech in in San Francisco and a March 2014 Univision interview. See more detail on these presidential statements in our document here. White House response By email, White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded to our query about McCaul’s claim by pointing out a Nov. 19, 2014, memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating the president’s 2014 actions fit within the government’s discretionary powers. The office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. Our ruling McCaul said Obama ""said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority to"" act as he did on immigration. The Texan’s count is too high – we see less than 15 solid examples from 2010 into 2014 – but his statement is spot-on about Obama often saying he couldn’t do more absent congressional action. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097131080>],/factchecks/2014/dec/05/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-says-obama-said-over-20-times-he-la/

Bryant Gumbel says a golf course closes somewhere in America every 48 hours
","Talking up a local golf course, an Austin American-Statesman reader caused us to look into a fade-shot claim from HBO’s Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel. Bob Brockmann said in a letter published on the newspaper’s editorial page Dec. 2, 2014 that he’d just watched an episode of the program revealing that ""golf lost 5 million players in the last 10 years, and as a result one golf course closes every 48 hours in America."" Brockman’s letter also said: ""I am an avid golfer and hate to see this trend, but it’s a reality. Let’s try to fight the trend by keeping Muni open,"" he wrote, referring to the beloved Lions Municipal Golf Course in West Austin that could be developed into a mix of offices, apartments and shops. Fore! A golf course closes every 48 hours? In the HBO episode, which debuted in July 2014, Gumbel said: ""On average, 130 courses have closed every year for the last eight years, from midwestern Michigan to the coast of California, from the tip of Florida to the top of Minnesota."" Gumbel, describing the closings as the hangover after the sport’s explosive growth in the Tiger Woods era, added: ""A golf course closes somewhere in America every 48 hours."" By telephone, the producer of the episode, Nick Dolin, told us that according to the National Golf Foundation, 157.5 U.S. golf courses closed in 2013. That breaks out to one all-holes-down every 56 hours. ""We took a slight liberty,"" Dolin said. ""It’s a slight exaggeration."" The foundation, which says it delivers independent market intelligence to keep golf businesses ahead, says on its ""frequently asked questions"" web page that as of Jan. 1, 2014, there were 15,516 U.S. golf facilities, as in complexes with at least one golf course. The foundation says that compares to 15,890 in 2010 and 16,052 in 2005. As of 2014, Texas was home to 790 facilities; Michigan, New York and California each had more with Florida leading other states with 1,048, according to the page. There were 157.5 course closures in 2013, the foundation says, with a course defined as having 18 holes, the number that makes up a round of golf. Still, 14 courses opened, the foundation says. Golf may be slipping in popularity. There were about 25 million golfers age 6 or older in 2012, the foundation says, compared to 30 million in 2005. By email, we sought more detail; a foundation spokesman, Marc Blatchley, replied by pointing out a January 2014 foundation newsletter story stating that in 2013, U.S. golf-course closings outpaced openings for the eighth straight year. Blatchley also told us that in Texas in 2013, the equivalent of 8.5 18-hole courses closed and 0.5 courses opened. The newsletter story said: ""The overall reduction in supply is a gradual, natural market correction of the existing imbalance of supply and demand. Since the market correction began in 2006, there has been a cumulative net reduction of 643 golf courses… which represents a drop of about 4% off the peak supply year of 2005. ""However, the cumulative decline over that period should be considered in context,"" the story said.""Over the 20-year period from 1986 to 2005, U.S. golf grew by more than 40%, as more than 4,500 new courses were added."" That’s a new course every 39 hours! (Ok, irrelevant. But par for this story, yes?) ""Although there will be excellent new golf courses being built in the future, the gradual market correction is expected to continue for the next few years,"" the story said. Our ruling Gumbel said a ""golf course closes somewhere in America every 48 hours."" In 2013, actually, the rate was one 18-hole course closing every 56 hours and that’s before appropriately taking into account the year’s 14 reported openings, which means the nation experienced one less golf course every 61 hours.

Viral photo of Ferguson protester doesn't withstand close scrutiny
","In the wake of several high-profile confrontations between white police officers and unarmed African-Americans recently, social media has become a major source of accusations, arguments -- and hoaxes. Recently, a reader sent us a photo that has been circulating on social media, showing an African-American protester standing in front of a fire station and holding up a hand-lettered sign that reads, ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store."" The sign is an obvious reference to the death of Michael Brown, the black teenager who was shot and killed in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Brown’s death became a focus for both peaceful protests and rioting in Ferguson, and it attracted attention around the nation and the world. On Nov. 25, a grand jury decided not to indict, setting off a new wave of demonstrations. The phrase ""every time he robs a store"" refers to surveillance footage showing Brown earlier that day robbing a store of cigarillos and assaulting a store employee. Supporters of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown, have said the robbery is an important piece of context in explaining Wilson’s shooting of Brown. Still, the PolitiFact reader asked us whether the photo was real or manufactured, so we decided to take a look. The version we received is cropped to focus on the African-American man holding the sign, with a partial view of a woman standing to his left. Other versions, such as one analyzed by Snopes.com, include a fuller view of the woman, holding a sign that says, ""Shame on Ferguson Police,"" as well as another man, an African-American, holding a sign that says, ""We the People."" The starkly divergent messages of the three signs provide a clue that something is amiss. And indeed, something is amiss. In the original photograph -- published on the Riverfront Times’ news blog on Oct. 1 -- the sign read, ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home"" (emphasis added). It also includes the hashtags #blacklivesmatter and #stayhuman. But words on the sign were doctored by a user of the social media site Imgur. Initially, the user posted this statement with the retouched photograph: ""The black community has every reason to be angry with the police, and the brutality they inflict. But making a martyr out of the kid that robbed a store and attacked a police officer is just mind boggling. Micheal (sic) Brown is one of the worst things to happen to race relations in a long time."" At some point after the doctored version of the image began circulating, the user acknowledged that he had changed the picture: ""Edit: Yes, I shopped this. It captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation."" Our ruling A photograph that went viral purports to show a protester in Ferguson, holding a sign that said, ""No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store."" However, the photo was manipulated by a social media user, who later acknowledged the alteration. The change in wording turns the sign’s message completely on its head, so we rate the claim Pants On Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280971CCF80>],/factchecks/2014/dec/04/chain-email/viral-photo-ferguson-protester-doesnt-withstand-cl/

RNC chair Reince Priebus says Barack Obama has 'the worst record of any president' on debt
","Public concern about America’s debt load tends to wax and wane, but it never really goes away. Recently, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, brought up the national debt again, right around the time the broadest measure of national debt broke through the $18 trillion barrier for the first time. On Dec. 2, 2014, Priebus said that President Barack Obama has ""the worst record of any president when it comes to putting America deeper in debt,"" according to an account in The Hill newspaper. He went on to call the growth in debt ""immoral"" and said voters had ""tired of Democrats’ free-spending ways."" We wondered how accurate it was for Priebus to describe Obama as having ""the worst record of any president when it comes to putting America deeper in debt."" (While the Obama administration has touted its success in helping shrink the annual federal deficit, Priebus was clearly referencing debt, not the deficit, even though the two are obviously related.) When we checked with the RNC, spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said the gross federal debt -- the amount of debt held by the public plus the amount of debt held by government entities -- had risen from $10.6 trillion to about $18 trillion during Obama’s time in office, making it the largest increase in raw dollars during any presidency. Meanwhile, she added, the subset of debt that’s held by the public has more than doubled under Obama. When we looked into these numbers, they checked out. However, given the snowballing effect of inflation and debt accumulation, it’s not surprising that whoever the most recent president is -- Republican or Democrat -- would experience the biggest increases in raw dollars of debt. So we looked at two other measurements that give a better sense of context for how much the debt climbed under Obama. We used the Treasury Department’s daily database of federal debt, called Debt to the Penny, for data going back to 1993. For earlier presidencies, we used historical data from the Office of Management and Budget. We decided to use the broader measure of gross debt rather than the narrower measure of public debt -- even though both are valid measures of debt -- because for the past three presidents, data on gross debt is more consistently accessible. Meanwhile, to limit the impact of irregular presidential tenures, we looked at nine presidential periods of either four or eight years each: Eisenhower; Kennedy and Johnson combined; Nixon and Ford combined; Carter; Reagan; George H.W. Bush; Clinton; George W. Bush; and Obama. (We didn't go further back than Eisenhower because the high debt levels in the World War II era were a historical anomaly.) Debt as a share of GDP The first measure we looked at was growth in debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP. Experts say this is an important yardstick because it gives a sense of how burdensome the debt is on the economy. Smaller economies can sustain smaller debt loads; bigger ones can tolerate bigger debt loads. Using this measure, Priebus has a point. The Obama years rank first -- that is to say, worst -- among the nine presidential tenures when measured by the increase in debt as a share of GDP. At the end of fiscal year 2008, around the time Obama took office, gross federal debt accounted for 67.7 percent of GDP. The estimate for fiscal year 2014 is 103.2 percent. That’s a 35.5 percentage-point increase over six years -- far higher than any prior president we looked at, even those who served for a full eight years. (The end of fiscal 2008 was a few months before Obama took office -- a fact that has caused us headaches in the past -- but in this case, the gap is so wide that the discrepancy doesn’t make a significant difference.) So big is the gap between Obama and the other presidents, in fact, that only three of the other eight tenures we studied saw any increase at all in debt as a share of GDP. Debt as a share of GDP went up by 18 percentage points under Reagan, by 12.3 points under George W. Bush, and by 11.7 percentage points under George H.W. Bush. By contrast, every other president or combined presidential tenure saw a decline in the share of debt within GDP. Under Carter it went down by 2.6 points, under Nixon and Ford it fell by 5.9 points, under Clinton it fell by 6.8 points, under Kennedy and Johnson it was down by 13.3 points, and under Eisenhower it fell by 18.2 percentage points. Percentage increase in debt from inauguration to end of tenure However -- if you use a second measure, the numbers are more favorable toward Obama. We looked at how much the gross debt grew from day one of the presidency to the end of that presidency, then adjusted for the length of time in office. On this list, the debt under Obama grew at the third-fastest pace -- and, awkwardly for Priebus, the two presidents under whom debt grew faster were both Republicans. Reagan saw the biggest percentage increase in debt on his watch, at about 23 percent per year, followed by George H.W. Bush at about 13 percent per year and Obama at 11.5 percent per year. Those who saw slower debt growth than Obama were Carter (an increase of 11 percent a year), George W. Bush (10.8 percent a year), Nixon and Ford (8.8 percent a year), Clinton (4.6 percent per year), Kennedy and Johnson (3.3 percent per year), and Eisenhower (1.5 percent per year). So, whether Obama ranks as ""the worst"" at debt accumulation depends on how you measure it. Who gets the blame? Another important factor to consider: How much is Obama responsible for this increase in debt? Presidents do have an impact on the debt accrued during their tenure, but that impact is not all-encompassing. Presidents propose budgets and sign off, along with Congress, on final spending and revenue numbers. Programs they initiate cost money and, unless enough other spending is cut to produce a surplus, debt inevitably goes up. In addition, debt tends to rise particularly quickly during recessions -- and Obama came into office with a doozy of a recession under way. In the debt per GDP measure, Obama was hit coming and going, since the numerator (debt) rose even as the denominator (GDP) fell during the recession. ""Certainly the Great Recession had a big impact"" on debt accumulation under Obama, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The recession, he said, meant both higher spending (on programs to aid the newly jobless and financially struggling) but also a loss in tax revenue (as once-employed Americans stopped earning wages they would have to pay taxes on). In addition, the Baby Boomer generation retired in increasing numbers under Obama, meaning both higher spending and fewer tax revenues. ""So it’s a mixed bag, and all presidents are a bit trapped by their time,"" Ellis said. ""Did Reagan-Bush policies help create the surpluses experienced under Clinton? Republicans say so. Did the George W. Bush policies create the economic downturn that sent the debt soaring under Obama? Democrats say yes. Ultimately, all presidents are impacted by their predecessors’ policies and can be roiled by external forces."" This suggests that Obama bears some responsibility for the rise in debt, but hardly all. Our ruling Priebus said Obama has ""the worst record of any president when it comes to putting America deeper in debt."" On Obama’s watch, debt as a share of GDP rose far faster than it did during any prior presidency. But if you look at the current amount of debt compared to where he started, the rise was not as fast as it was under Reagan and the elder Bush, two Republican predecessors. And while presidents bear some responsibility for debt accumulation, much of the equation -- economic and demographic changes and the consequences of prior president’s actions, in particular -- is out of their control. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC3D00>],/factchecks/2014/dec/04/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-says-barack-obama-has-wor/

Bill O'Reilly cites faulty data for claim about shooting deaths of blacks, whites by police
","Bill O’Reilly made headlines this week by offering his take on a silent Ferguson protest by a few members of the NFL’s St. Louis Rams, saying the decision of the players ""connotes the fact that they believe, I guess, that white police officers shoot black youths all the time."" That’s out of bounds of a fact-check. But O’Reilly did present some statistics in the same argument that several readers asked us to examine. ""Let's take a good look at this plague of white cops acting violently against blacks, as (professor and liberal columnist Michael Eric) Dyson puts it,"" O’Reilly said on his Dec. 1, 2014, Fox News program. ""In the past 50 years, the rate of black Americans killed by police has dropped 70 percent. In 2012, 123 African-Americans were shot dead by police. There are currently more than 43 million blacks living in the U.S.A. Same year, 326 whites were killed by police bullets. Those are the latest stats available."" Later in the show, O’Reilly said of these numbers, ""That's not an epidemic. It's not crazy. It's not a hunting-down of black youth."" This is not the first time we have evaluated pundits’ half-truths comparing black and white deaths from police killings. Like the other cases, O’Reilly is citing available government statistics, but these numbers are shaky and don’t paint a complete picture. Lack of national data O’Reilly’s team used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s fatal injury reports database. A search in the system for fatal ""legal interventions"" -- deaths caused in the course of law enforcement trying to make an arrest or quell a situation -- confirms, on the surface, the numbers O’Reilly mentioned for whites and African-Americans. How does the CDC get the number? Primarily from causes of death listed in death certificates from coroners, medical examiners and physicians and demographic information provided by funeral directors. Figures are further supplemented by a violent death reporting system that includes data from 17 states. (Legal interventions include state executions.) But experts told us the data is likely incomplete because coroners and physicians are under no obligation to detail police involvement in the deaths that they encounter. ""It is not known or certain that every death certificate indicates that the death was caused by law enforcement officer in every jurisdiction,"" said Samuel Walker, retired professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. Another database, this one maintained by the FBI, attempts to get at the same figure. But it’s no more solid. The FBI reports rely on self-reported data from a small chunk of the nation’s more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies. The lack of a national clearinghouse for fatal police killings ""is a national embarrassment,"" said Geoffrey Alpert, a University of South Carolina criminology professor who specializes in high-risk police activities. ""I’m sure one of (O’Reilly’s) researchers pulled a number from that database, but it’s just a convenient fact, as someone used to say,"" he said. More problems with O’Reilly’s numbers Beyond the lack of clear national data for these deaths, experts found more problems with O’Reilly’s citation of CDC numbers. O’Reilly’s reference of the number of whites killed in legal interventions does not strictly account for non-Hispanic whites. People who identify as Hispanic are also counted in the total of 326 deaths. Running the search again for whites but excluding Hispanics leaves 227 deaths from legal interventions -- substantially fewer deaths due to the absence of 97 white Hispanics previously in the mix (in the black category, two were identified as black Hispanic). ""So if you are interested in people of color, what they list in the white data is too high,"" Walker said of O’Reilly’s figures. Additionally, the per capita rate of black deaths per 100,000 residents is .28, which is twice as high as the rate for white deaths of .13, Walker points out. Our ruling O’Reilly said, 123 African-Americans and 326 white people were shot dead by police in 2012. He referenced recent federal numbers but failed to mention their well-documented flaws. We have not found any experts who will vouch for numbers that purport to represent annual fatal shootings by police, as there are gaping holes within each dataset. Additionally, the number of white people fatally shot by police in 2012 is substantially off if you account for white Hispanics -- a group O’Reilly did not seem to have in mind during his rant about race relations between blacks and whites. O’Reilly’s statement contains an element of truth, but it’s not the full picture he makes it out to be. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972C60C0>],/factchecks/2014/dec/04/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-cites-faulty-data-claim-about-shootin/
"['National', 'Congress', 'Health Care', 'Charles Schumer']","
The uninsured vote at low rates, says Charles Schumer
","Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer ruffled some feathers among his own party recently when he said passing Obamacare was the wrong thing to do. In remarks at the National Press Club Nov. 25, Schumer, of New York, said it wasn’t politically prudent for the Democrats in Congress to focus their energy on health care. The vast majority of voters who brought President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats into office in 2008, Schumer said, wanted policy that addressed the recession, not health insurance. In fact, he said, uninsured voters -- those who would get many of the law’s immediate benefits -- were a relatively insignificant portion of the electorate. ""The Affordable Care Act was aimed at the 36 million Americans who were not covered,"" Schumer said. ""It's been reported that only a third of the uninsured are even registered to vote. In 2010, only about 40 percent of those registered voted. So even if the uninsured kept with the rate, which they likely didn't, you would still only be talking about 5 percent of the electorate."" There’s a lot packed into that quote, but we’re most interested in the last part of Schumer’s claim: that uninsured voters only made up 5 percent of the electorate in 2010, the year Congress passed the Affordable Care Act.   We asked Schumer’s office where they got that stat. They laid out for us their calculations, using figures from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Election Project, a website run by a University of Florida professor that tracks election data. Well, we crunched the numbers ourselves, and our results lined up with Schumer’s. Here’s how we got those figures. In 2010, about 42.6 million people of voting age were uninsured, according to the Census. Of those 42.6 million, we estimated that 14.6 percent -- or 6.2 million -- are illegal immigrants, according to the Migration Policy Institute, meaning they are not eligible voters. This brings us down to about 36.4 million eligible voters who do not have health insurance. We should note that this figure does not account for people who are ineligible to vote for other reasons, such as a felony conviction. Additionally, Schumer’s office came up with a slightly lower count than we did.   The next step is to find out how many of these 36.4 million uninsured eligible voters actually voted in 2010. That year, 41.8 percent of the voting-eligible population in the United States voted in the general election. Schumer said in his National Press Club remarks that he assumed that voter turnout among the uninsured reflected overall voter turnout. And 41.8 percent of the 36.5 million uninsured eligible voters is 15.2 million. Then we calculated what percentage of the total electorate (217.6 million) are these 15.2 million uninsured eligible voters -- 7 percent, compared to Schumer’s 5 percent figure. In any case, both Schumer’s and our calculations potentially overestimate the number of uninsured people who voted in the 2010 general election. That’s because the uninsured population is less likely to vote than the insured population. An October 2014 Pew Research Center study found that of all ""likely voters,"" 93 percent have insurance coverage, and only 7 percent do not have coverage. (Compare this to the general population, of which 13.4 percent is uninsured, as of October 2014.) ""I believe (the Pew figures support Schumer’s) point on the more limited potential impact of the uninsured vote on this election,"" said Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University. Additionally, the uninsured population has a lower level of voter registration than the insured, according to a 2012 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll. The poll found that 64 percent of uninsured people are registered to vote, compared to 86 percent of insured people. Our ruling Schumer said that in 2010, uninsured voters made up 5 percent of the electorate. We crunched the numbers and came up with a figure close to Schumer’s -- 7 percent. There’s reason to believe, though, that 5 percent and 7 percent are both overestimates. This only reinforces Schumer’s overall point that the uninsured don’t make up a significant portion of actual voters. We rate Schumer’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C13C940>],/factchecks/2014/dec/04/charles-schumer/uninsured-vote-low-rates-charles-schumer/
"['Military', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Will too many tattoos keep you out of military? Jeb Bush says yes
","Failing test scores aren't the only problem that has caused the military to reject applicants, says former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Another problem is, well, more colorful: tattoos. While talking about his push to improve public education at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Dec. 1, Bush pointed to problems the military has finding qualified applicants. Bush mentioned a video in which a military official talked about the challenge: ""In the video beforehand, Gen. Dempsey talked about a 25 percent pass rate. Now that’s not just because of the test, that’s also because of obesity, and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school-level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. These are abysmal numbers."" PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about whether obesity and physical fitness have kept applicants out of the military (both true). But we hadn’t explored the role of tattoos in filling the military ranks. We couldn’t resist taking a look. Tattoo policies Each branch of the service sets their own rules about tattoos, but it was the Army’s policy that has drawn the most ink recently from the media. In March 2014, the Army overhauled its appearance policy, which includes more than two pages of detailed rules about ""tattoo, branding and body mutilation."" This led to a rush to get tatted so soldiers could be grandfathered in under the new rules. The Army has a detailed procedure for grandfathering that directs unit commanders to document each tattoo in an official memorandum. The Army’s policy states that tattoos, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body, including the wrists, hands and fingers, as well as the head, face, and neck, defined as ""anything above the t-shirt neck line to include on/inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears."" ""Soldiers may have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow (to the wrist bone) or below the knee,"" the policy says. So far under the new policy, 2,919 applicants could not process due to tattoos, said Brian Lepley, an Army recruiting spokesman. ""Those 2,919 are the ones whose tattoos were so egregious it was highly unlikely a waiver could get through, or the applicant chose not to try a waiver,"" he said. In the Army, 193 tattoo waivers for applicants have been granted, while one was rejected and four are pending. Lepley told us that tattoos are not the No. 1 disqualifier. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct or some combination of those issues disqualify more applicants. News reports around the country indicate the tattoo policy is limiting applicants, though. ""Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away one in every five applicants that come through our door,"" U.S. Army Captain Joshua Jacquez told CNN in a report from El Paso. Maj. Gen. Allen W. Batschelet, head of Army recruiting at Fort Knox, told the Kansas City Star in August that the policy is, ""rather arbitrary, in some sense."" However he said that ""you have to draw the line somewhere"" for the Army to present a professional image. As for waivers, Batschelet said, ""To be blunt, the higher quality of applicant you are, the more tolerance we'd probably have for seeking a waiver. If you came in to sign up today and were a neurosurgeon, I got to tell you I'd go a long way toward trying to get an exception if all you had was a disqualifying tattoo."" The Air Force, Marines and Navy also have their own tattoo policies. All of them generally ban tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination or express offensive views. The Air Force policy has a seven-step measurement guide that contains math formulas in an attempt to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. (Partial inches should be rounded up to the nearest inch, it says.) The Marines policy states that applicants with more than four tattoos must be administratively reviewed. The Navy’s policy is the least detailed -- only 277 words -- though like the other services, it bans head tattoos. Our ruling Bush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military -- in addition to being obese or not passing the test -- is that some have ""too many tattoos"" on visible body parts. Since the Army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year, 2,919 applicants could not proceed due to tattoos. Other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B94640>],/factchecks/2014/dec/03/jeb-bush/too-many-visible-tattoos-keep-out-military-jeb-bus/
"['National', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Marc Morial']","
Are deaths from police shootings the highest in 20 years?
","The shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by former Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson has sparked national dialogues ranging from the racial makeup of police forces to the militarization of local law enforcement. Another issue up for debate is the use of deadly force by police. On this topic, we heard a noteworthy statistic from National Urban League CEO Marc Morial during an appearance on Fox News Sunday: ""The number of killings of citizens by police is at a two-decade high."" The stat caught our attention, but is it accurate? At first blush, it looked like Morial is on solid ground. He has two good sources for his claim: USA Today and the FBI. But as we dug deeper, we discovered sizeable shortcomings in the data. A spokeswoman for the National Urban League pointed us to the USA Today story. The headline: ""Police killings highest in two decades."" USA Today reviewed data collected by the FBI for its annual Uniformed Crime Report and a statistic called ""justifiable homicide by law enforcement."" We looked at the statistics ourselves. In 2013, the latest year on record, there were 458 justifiable homicides involving a firearm. The previous high was in 1994, when 460 were reported. Here’s a graph of justifiable homicides by law enforcement:  This would seem to make it a cut-and-dried case. However, as we learned from experts who have studied crime statistics and police-involved shooting, there are significant holes in the FBI data that cast doubts on whether real conclusions can be drawn from the statistics. Even the USA Today story the National Urban League linked us to highlighted many of the inadequacies of the data. Other news outlets have noted the limitations of the FBI statistics as well. Here’s the biggest problem: There is no mandate that local law enforcement agencies report officer involved shootings to the FBI. While 18,000 city, university, county, state, tribal and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily participate in the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report, just a small fraction of them willingly provide data on deadly force and justifiable homicides within their departments. Robert Worden, professor at the University of Albany School of Criminal Justice, said ""the actual number of such homicides may be as high as double the FBI’s counts."" ""(Morial’s) claim might be true, but it’s impossible to say with confidence,"" Worden said. ""The consensus among experts is that these data are unsatisfactory, leaving questions about the number of people shot and killed by police in any year and trends in that number over time completely open."" David Klinger, a professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said there is no reason to believe the number of agencies that do report are representative of the population, and the number who report may fluctuate from year to year. It’s entirely possible that the reason the number went up from 2012 to 2013 is simply because more police agencies reported their officer-involved shootings than in previous years. Even less definitive conclusions can be drawn from comparing 2013 results to 1994. And there’s no way to extrapolate the FBI figures because there is no benchmark that indicates by how much the information is underreported. We couldn’t even tell if more or fewer police departments were reporting the numbers over the years. A spokesman for the FBI did not get back to us. Klinger said academics and others in the field have publicly questioned these numbers for decades. ""I wish people would just admit that the data sucks and they shouldn't be using it for anything other than to say, that’s the baseline number of people who have been reported to be killed by the police in a given year,"" Klinger said. ""To talk about trends against time? No, we don’t know what agencies are coming in and out of reporting and how many are accurately reporting."" Are there any other sources for the data? Not really. James McGinty, spokesman for the Police Executive Research Forum, a think tank focused on best practices for law enforcement, said there’s no data that’s conclusive, even for determining basic trend lines. ""We certainly think there should be better data on this,"" McGinty said. The Bureau of Justice Statistics used to track the number of deaths while in police custody, a similar but imperfect number. However, the data only goes from 2003 to 2009 and it appears it has not been updated since. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates deaths in cases of ""legal intervention"" which includes ""injuries inflicted by the police or other law-enforcing agents, including military on duty, in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest lawbreakers, suppressing disturbances, maintaining order, and other legal actions."" However, this is a calculated statistic based on sample surveys and the data only goes back to 1999 anyway. Lorie Fridell, a professor at the University of South Florida Department of Criminology, surveyed most local law enforcement agencies in the country and found the vast majority track the number of officer-involved shootings internally. However, there is no national clearinghouse for the data and mandating reporting to the federal level would be a challenge. ""Individual researchers sometimes collect this information from multiple departments, but even those latter efforts do not come close to providing us with reliable national data,"" Fridell said. Our ruling Morial said, ""The number of killings of citizens by police is at a two-decade high."" Morial was quoting a USA Today analysis based on FBI statistics. In that sense, Morial seemed to have good sources. But digging deeper showed the information is hardly reliable.  Only a fraction of law enforcement agencies provide this data to the FBI, and the agencies reporting changes every year. These problems are not new and were in fact noted in the USA Today story he referenced. Normally we would put more stock in FBI statistics. But in this case there are many known problems with the data.

"['Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Glenn Grothman']","
Glenn Grothman says 20 percent of federal budget is borrowed
","Wisconsin Republican Congressman-elect Glenn Grothman foresees another showdown with President Barack Obama over federal spending. ""I assume he’s going to want to spend a lot more on a lot of programs than we are,"" the Republican from Campbellsport said Nov. 30, 2014, on ""UpFront with Mike Gousha."" Grothman, elected to succeed retiring Republican Tom Petri, threw out a statistic to make his point: ""Just the fact that right now we’re borrowing 20% of our budget does show there are going to be some big differences between the president and us on government spending."" Last time we fact checked a similar budget-borrowing claim was mid-2011. Then, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin made two points in an interview regarding an increase in the federal government’s debt limit. One of them was that America borrows 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends. In other words, 42 percent. That was accurate, we found, based on actual budget figures from fiscal year 2010 and estimates for 2012. (Some problems with the other part of his claim dragged the overall rating down to Half True). That time period, marked by the Great Recession, coincided with the deepest borrowing for federal purposes since World War II. Let’s bring this up to date. Grothman was using accurate figures from a reliable source. He made the same claim repeatedly during his congressional campaign earlier this year. But the numbers were slightly out of date by the time he spoke on Gousha’s show. In fiscal year 2013, the U.S. government’s outlays outstripped revenues by $680 billion, forcing borrowing that amounted to 20 percent of spending. The fiscal year ended in September 2013. That’s what Grothman cited. But we now have federal spending and revenue data through the end of the 2014 federal fiscal year that ended in September 2014. They show the deficit was still large, but fell significantly, to $483 billion, according to a summary of U.S. Treasury figures analyzed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In the latest accounting, the borrowing figure amounts to 13.8 percent, the lowest since just before the recession. Deficits have been falling markedly in recent years. As we reported in rating True an Obama claim at LaborFest in Milwaukee in September 2014, deficits have dropped by more than half during his presidency as the economic recovery has boosted tax revenues and spending on emergency assistance has dropped. The Treasury and White House announced the results on Oct. 15, 2014, six weeks before Grothman’s appearance on ""UpFront."" The subsequent CBO report came out Nov. 10, 2014, about three weeks before Grothman made the claim. Looking ahead to the 2015 budget, the borrowing proportion is predicted to drop again, noted Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He cited CBO projections. A final note on the bottom line. The declining share of borrowing doesn’t mean overall spending is dropping. In 2014, spending actually went up 1.4 percent, but revenues increased 9 percent as a result of stronger flows of individual and corporate income tax receipts, as well as payroll tax deductions for social insurance programs. In 2014, Social Security rose by $37 billion (or 5 percent); Medicare increased $14 billion (or 3 percent); and Medicaid rose $36 billion (or 14 percent), largely because of the expansion of insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the Congressional Budget Office reported. On the other hand, spending for unemployment benefits declined by $24 billion (or 33 percent) as fewer people received benefits after an emergency extension expired, CBO said. Our rating Grothman claimed that ""We’re borrowing 20% of our budget."" He was on target earlier this year with that figure based on 2013 results, but the latest numbers are just in for 2014 and show a decline from that 20 percent mark. On balance we rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809670D5C0>],/factchecks/2014/dec/03/glenn-grothman/glenn-grothman-says-20-percent-federal-budget-borr/

Councilwoman right that annexation drew Reed to city
","Atlanta may have been founded as the end of the line, but it has hardly held to that designation. Founded in 1847, Atlanta’s original city limits were a single-mile radius around the Zero Mile Post, or terminus of the Western & Atlantic Railroad. Today, the city covers nearly 132 square miles of land stretched out over two counties. Terminus is little more than a marker next to the southern entrance of Underground Atlanta (and a particularly distasteful safe haven for ""The Walking Dead"" fans). With two more communities on the edges of the city debating whether to join Atlanta, one city councilwoman was quoted in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story talking about what recent annexations meant for the city. ""You brought in a mayor with the last annexation,"" District 11 Councilwoman Keisha Lance Bottoms said of Mayor Kasim Reed, referring to the 2006 annexation of what is now known as southwest Atlanta. Is that right, that growing Atlanta’s borders created the opportunity for Reed, a former state senator, to become Atlanta’s 59th mayor? The AJC Truth-O-Meter spun back in time to find out. The city’s Geographic Information Systems department keeps detailed maps of Atlanta’s 133 annexations. All but 18 of those actions have been to grow the city, including the massive addition of Buckhead and Lakewood in 1952. One of the outliers was a decision to hold off on annexing Sandtown in 2006. That south Fulton community, along with the DeKalb County sections of the historic Druid Hills community, is now weighing whether to join Atlanta. If there is another round of annexations, it will be the first changing of the city’s borders since 2007, when Atlanta absorbed three Southside subdivisions. Bottoms, though, said she was referring to the much larger 2006 annexation that brought in about 2,000 residents from then-newly developed subdivisions along Cascade Road as it passes south and west out of the city. The councilwoman herself has lived in that area, also known as Midwest Cascade, since the mid-1990s. She was active in her subdivision’s homeowners association when the community was part of unincorporated Fulton County. The annexation paved the way for her to run for the council, where she has served since 2010. Reed was sworn in that same year. PolitiFact Georgia recently ruled Mostly True that Reed’s first term was marked by keeping campaign promises such as a major pension overhaul and hiring more police officers. ""We both lived in the same area, in two different neighborhoods,"" Bottoms said. ""Annexation meant there was an opportunity for people who had lived there to run for city office and get involved."" Reed has said he supports annexing Druid Hills from DeKalb County and Sandtown in south Fulton, if those residents seek to join the city. But that is not because the former state senator – who represented pieces of unincorporated Fulton and Atlanta during his legislative tenure – was exactly the beneficiary of annexation the way that Bottoms described. Reed lived in Loch Lochman Estates during the 2006 annexation. That subdivision is literally down the street from what became Atlanta – but it was not included in the expansion. Today, it remains part of the unincorporated county. But Reed’s spokeswoman said that annexation did prompt him to move to Midwest Cascade, where he still lives. ""He moved, but he is in the same neighborhood,"" spokeswoman Anne Torres said. ""So the councilwoman is right to say that annexation did bring him in."" So where does that leave us? We won’t quibble with Bottoms’ reference to the last annexation, considering the small size of the 2007 additions. She is not quite right on her claim that the larger 2006 annexation included Reed’s subdivision, which opened the door to his candidacy. The mayor’s office said, though, that the move did push him to a different house in the same neighborhood so he could be a city resident. To that end, her point is correct. There is some additional context needed to make sense of it all. But overall, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A2740>],/factchecks/2014/dec/03/keisha-lance-bottoms/councilwoman-right-annexation-drew-reed-city/

Meme says Barack Obama has given 'no special recognition' to police killed in action
","Recent events in Ferguson, Mo., have inspired waves of anger on social media. Recently, a reader asked us to check one of the memes now circulating on the Internet. The meme pairs two images. One captures several flag-draped coffins, presumably of law enforcement officers. The other is a still from surveillance footage showing Michael Brown allegedly assaulting an employee at a convenience store that he’s suspected of robbing the day he was killed by police officer Darren Wilson. To these images, the meme adds the following text: ""Want to know where racial tension and cultural divide comes from? ""794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House. ""A man robs a convenience store and assaults a cop; the White House sends three representatives to his memorial service."" The meme appears to stem from the ""Culture Crisis in America"" Facebook community, which describes itself as ""an e-magazine for Americans subscribing to the notion that the cultural deterioration of American values rests within the root of economic and social crises across our land, and indeed, the globe."" We’ll quickly note that, according to news reports, the White House did send three representatives to the service for Brown: Broderick Johnson, chairman of the My Brother's Keeper Task Force; Marlon Marshall, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Heather Foster, an adviser in the public engagement office. (Marshall had personal as well as professional reasons to attend; he’s a St. Louis native and attended high school with Brown's mother.) Here, we'll focus on the meme's claim that Obama has been indifferent to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, giving them ""no special recognition."" Is that correct? Have 794 officers been killed in the line of duty since Obama was inaugurated? The meme footnotes its figure to the website Officer Down Memorial Page, a privately run page that memorializes and keeps count of the number of police killed in action every year. Between 2009 and Dec. 2, 2014, the site counted 834 deaths. The lower number on the meme probably because the number of deaths has increased since its creator first looked up the number. Due to differences in methodology, the Officer Down Memorial Page figure is somewhat higher than the official federal statistics, which are accessible in an FBI database known as ""Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted."" The FBI figures show 521 deaths from 2009 to 2013, roughly half from felonious homicides and half from accidents in the line of duty. If you extrapolate the numbers to include 2014, that would work out to roughly 625 deaths. That’s smaller than what was cited in the meme, but given the diversity of criteria that can be used to calculate this statistic, we’re not overly concerned about the meme’s number. (The Officer Down Memorial Page, for instance, counts deaths off-duty ""while acting in an official capacity to prevent loss of property, injury, or death, or is targeted because of his/her duties as a law enforcement officer."") One footnote: The numbers of fallen officers have been declining rather noticeably in recent years. According to the FBI statistics, the number of officers killed initially rose from 96 in 2009 to 128 in 2010, but then began falling, to 125, then 96 and finally to 76 in 2013. That’s a 41 percent decline in three years. Has there been ""no special recognition from the White House"" for fallen officers? This is where the meme is entirely off-base. We found many instances of White House ""special recognition"" for fallen officers.  Here’s a selection of events where Obama has appeared, all archived a few quick keystrokes away on the White House website: • May 7, 2010: Presidential proclamation for Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. Excerpt from proclamation: ""As a nation, we rely on law enforcement officers to keep our neighborhoods safe, enforce our laws, and respond in times of crisis. These men and women sustain peace and order across America, and we look to them as models of courage and integrity. This week, we honor their extraordinary service and sacrifice, and we remember the fallen heroes whose selfless acts have left behind safer streets and stronger communities."" • May 15, 2010: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: ""To the survivors of fallen law enforcement officers, our hearts go out to you for your loss. The husbands and wives, mothers and fathers you loved, they protected us all. And all Americans are grateful for the lives that they gave in the line of duty."" • May 12, 2011: Presidential remarks at a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring National Association of Police Organizations ""Top Cops"" Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: ""Tomorrow we know that you and your fellow first responders will be back on your diligent duty -- looking out for us, looking out for one another, looking back at times with fallen partners, determined to make sure that their extraordinary sacrifices were not in vain. And we will be standing behind you, as one nation and one people, proud of your actions, awed by your courage, and grateful for your service on our behalf."" • May 15, 2012: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: ""Today, with heavy hearts, we honor those who gave their lives. .... Their families are in our thoughts and prayers, as we remember the quiet courage of the men and women we have lost. … The rest of us can never fully understand what you go through. But please know that we hold you in our hearts -- not just today, but always. We are forever in your debt. And it is on behalf of all of us, the entire American people, that I offer my thoughts, my prayers, and my thanks. May God shine a light upon the fallen and comfort the mourning. May he protect the peacemakers who protect us every day."" • May 15, 2013: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: ""Scripture tells us, ‘None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.’ The brave officers we gather to remember today devoted themselves so fully to others -- to serve and to protect others -- that in the process they were willing to give their lives. And so, today, let us not remember them just for how they died, but also for how they lived. … We can never repay our debt to these officers and their families, but we must do what we can, with all that we have, to live our lives in a way that pays tribute to their memory."" • May 9, 2014: Presidential proclamation for Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. Excerpt from proclamation: ""During Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we celebrate those who protect and serve us every minute of every day, and we honor the courageous officers who devoted themselves so fully to others that in the process they laid down their lives. As we mourn the fallen, let us also remember how they lived."" Our ruling The Facebook meme said that ""794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House."" While the meme offered a reasonable approximation for the number of fallen officers, the meat of its accusation -- that Obama has ignored the suffering of law enforcement officers killed in action -- is demonstrably wrong. We found at least six instances in which Obama honored the lives of fallen officers in writing or in speeches. Archived information about these events was easily available to the public on the White House website, meaning that the meme’s creator was reckless in not taking them into account.
