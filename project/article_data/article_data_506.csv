Candidate calls opponent a ""career politician""
","So what makes someone a ""career politician""?We at AJC PolitiFact Georgia became curious recently when we saw an advertisement mailed by Doug MacGinnitie, a Republican candidate for secretary of state.""Who would you entrust with the integrity of Georgia's elections?"" it read. ""A career politician or an independent thinker?""The ad didn't name names, but it was clear MacGinnitie was referring to the current officeholder, Brian Kemp, as the ""career politician"" in the ad. MacGinnitie campaign manager Brandon Phillips confirmed our suspicion during a telephone interview that the reference to ""career politician"" was aimed at Kemp.""It's a two-person primary,"" he said. Kemp and MacGinnitie are the only Republican candidates in the July 20 primary. Kemp, who spent four years as a state senator, has made a point during the campaign that he is the more experienced candidate, Phillips said. Kemp served in the Georgia Senate from 2003 to 2006. Gov. Sonny Perdue appointed Kemp as secretary of state in January after Karen Handel resigned to run for governor. MacGinnitie was elected to the Sandy Springs City Council in 2007. ""I don't think you can convince voters that you're the best candidate because you've been around the longest,"" Phillips said.But does four years in the Georgia Legislature and five months as secretary of state constitute a ""career politician""? The MacGinnitie campaign says yes, if you add Kemp's failed bid to become state agriculture commissioner in 2006 and that Kemp considered a run for the Georgia Senate in 2007. Phillips' argument: How do you run for agriculture commissioner and run for a job as vastly different as secretary of state four years later?""You couldn't find a more extreme example of going from one extreme to another. ... I just don't see how you do that and say you are not a career politician,"" Phillips said.Kemp, 46, however, has been a developer and in the real estate business since he graduated from the University of Georgia in 1987. Even when he served in the Legislature, Kemp (drawing an annual government salary of about $17,000) maintained his interest in the development game. Last year, Kemp started a manufacturing business, campaign officials said. He claims a net worth of nearly $6.3 million. Kemp will make about $120,000 this year as secretary of state and about $100,000 from his business interests, said his campaign manager, Tim Fleming.""I would consider someone a career politician who's served 20 or 30 years,"" Fleming said.Most of the people we talked to agreed with the Kemp camp.When he thinks of career politicians, University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock considers Georgians like U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, U.S. Rep. John Lewis and U.S. Rep. John Linder. The four men have spent an average of 17.5 years in Congress.""Four years is an awfully short time to constitute a career unless these are dog years,"" Bullock said in an e-mail.Bob Holmes, who served 34 years as a Democratic state representative, thought the combination of Kemp's four years in the Legislature and now two subsequent campaigns since 2002 shows ""some truth"" to the MacGinnitie campaign's claim. ""What he's done in the past decade ... indicates he wants to be in politics for the rest of his career,"" said Holmes, a retired Clark Atlanta University professor.So is Kemp a ""career politician""? Well, the average length of service for a U.S. senator is 12.9 years and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives is 11 years, according to Congressional Research Service. Many of those elected officials held elected posts before going to Washington. Perdue, a former state senator, has spent 19 years as an elected official. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, a former state senator, is finishing his 16th year as an elected official. Then there is Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin, who's been in office since 1969. Kemp is building a political resume, but two terms in the Legislature, a failed bid for Irvin's job and this campaign don't add up at this point. We rate Doug MacGinnitie's claim as False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/20/doug-macginnitie/candidate-calls-opponent-career-politician/

GOP nominee says Lloyd Doggett of Austin is No. 1 liberal in Congress
","Rousing delegates to the Republican Party of Texas’s state convention, physician Donna Campbell of Columbus lit into her November foe, calling U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, “the most liberal man in the United States Congress.”Campbell’s characterization June 12 touched off a supportive outburst from the partisans gathered in Dallas.No doubt, Doggett, elected to the House in 1994 after stints as a state senator and Texas Supreme Court justice, has long been a liberal—proudly so. We wondered, though, if he’s among the nation’s most liberal members compared, say, to solons from other left-leaning districts. When we reached Campbell to seek the basis for her statement, she  couldn’t immediately visit; she was on duty in a hospital.Next, we endeavored to gauge Doggett's liberal lean following a methodology forged by PolitiFact in Washington when it  explored a similar charge.  In June 2008, the expected GOP presidential nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said then-Sen. Barack Obama had accumulated the Senate’s most liberal voting record. PolitiFact found that Barely True. Also, we presumed that despite her wording, Campbell was comparing Doggett to all his colleagues, male and female, in the House and Senate. But for our analysis, we limited ourselves to the 435-member House; that seemed both reasonable and more doable than trying to compare Doggett's record to every other member of the House and Senate. We started our check by clicking to online ratings compiled by the National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine. According to the Journal, Doggett’s 2009 voting record made him the House’s 163rd most liberal member, more so on social issues than economic or foreign policy, according to its tabulation of 92 House votes. From Texas alone, seven other Democrats had more liberal records, the Journal said.We also looked at the two preceding years. According to the Journal, Doggett’s votes in 2007 and 2008 made him the House’s 119th most liberal member and 97th most liberal member, respectively, in those years—not No. 1.Congressional Quarterly doesn’t rate members on a conservative-liberal teeter-totter. Instead it gauges whether members vote in step with the president or their party. In 2009, CQ says, Doggett voted with President Obama 89 percent of the time and with his party 95 percent of the time.According to an online chart, Doggett’s votes land landed him among members most likely to support their party and president, which does not put him in centrist company. Still, about 200 members, all Democrats, voted more often than Doggett in accord with Obama and about 175 members were more likely to vote the Democratic Party’s way, CQ charts suggest. For another comparison, we turned to voteview.com, a site overseen by Keith Poole, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. According to voteview’s latest review of the House, Doggett is about the 117th most liberal member. Poole told us in an e-mail there is “no denying that Doggett is a conventional liberal but he is not an ‘extreme’ liberal.”  After we alerted Campbell to how Doggett was rated by the outside measures, she replied in an e-mail: “It absolutely would have been more accurate (for me) to include the phrase ‘one of the most’” instead of saying Doggett was the most liberal man in Congress. “I’m not a practiced or polished politician and public speaking, like for many of us, is a skill I’m still honing,” Campbell said. “Before hundreds, or thousands of eyes, I sometimes speed too quickly through what I’d like to say. The point I was making is that Mr. Doggett’s ideology is considerably more liberal than mine, and considerably more liberal than what many, many Central Texans are telling me they want to see in their U.S. representative.” So, how does the doctor’s convention charge stick? Like melting butter. Doggett is liberal, but he’s by no measure the most liberal member of Congress, voting analyses show. Campbell owned up after we followed up. Her statement is False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/20/donna-campbell/gop-nominee-says-lloyd-doggett-austin-no-1-liberal/

Libertarian Party says major parties have shed registered voters since 2008 while Libertarian registrations are up
","Just before the Libertarian Party of Texas held its state convention, it suggested its fortunes are rising while the two major political parties are on the decline. “The Republican Party lost 1.1 million registered voters since 2008,” the Libertarians said in a June 7 press release. “The Democratic Party lost 1.2 million registered voters in that time period. There is one exception: the Libertarian Party. Over the same time frame, voter registration in the Libertarian Party rose 8 percent.” Did the major parties bleed voters while the LPT surged? Significantly, party affiliations based on voter registration records can only be gauged in the 29 states that allow citizens to declare an affiliation when they register. Texas is among 21 states that don’t permit voters to air a preference at registration time. To  back up its claim, the Texas party’s release cites a blog post on smallgovtimes.com. We found that post largely based on research by Michael McDonald, an associate professor of Public and International Affairs at George Mason University. McDonald cites his research in two May posts at Pollster.com. In his first post, McDonald writes that since the 2008 election, voters registering as Democrats are down by 2.7 percent and voters registering as Republicans have dropped 3.5 percent in those states where voters are allowed to register an affiliation. Voters registering their affiliation with a minor party increased by 2.4 percent, he writes. Still, McDonald does not see an incipient minor-party revolution afoot. “America is a long way from having a viable multi-party system at the federal level, like we are currently witnessing in the United Kingdom,” he says in his second post. “However, these trends are consistent with the notion that some American voters are willing to express their frustration with the major parties by registering with a minor political party or affiliating with no party. Indeed, the increase in unaffiliated registrations is a long-term phenomenon observed since the 1970s.” We contacted McDonald in hopes of boring in on Libertarian voter registrations. He told us he did not separately calculate registration for minor parties, but referred us to Richard Winger, a Libertarian himself and the editor of Ballot Access News, a monthly newsletter. A May 26 blog post by Winger says Libertarian registrations in places that allow registration by party are up 8 percent since October 2008 — the figure cited in the release from the Texas Libertarians. Generally, Winger writes, more “voters are registered Libertarians now than ever before. Between October 2008 and this spring, Libertarian registration rose in 19 of the 23 states that tally Libertarians. It declined in four states, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and South Dakota,” a state where the party has not been on the ballot since 2006.Professor McDonald told us he still doesn’t see Libertarians succeeding at the polls unless, he said, they move en masse to, say, lightly populated Wyoming. “They’re not concentrated enough in one state or district in order to win elections,” he said.Here’s why: Regardless of cited changes in party affiliation percentage-wise, the raw numbers of voters registering affiliations underscore the dominance of the major parties. As researched by McDonald, some 43.3 million voters now line up as Democrats, while 29.9 million align as Republicans. Meanwhile, 2.2 million voters are registered as members of minor parties. As of May, according to Winger’s research, more than 259,000 voters had registered affiliations with the Libertarian Party.Even if we assume that some of nearly 23.6 million unaffiliated voters in states where voters can register their affiliations end up supporting Libertarians at the polls, their numerical share of the electorate is swamped by either of the major parties.In elections, numbers are everything. That brings us to a statistical problem with the Libertarian’s statement: it compares a reduction in numbers (how many voters fell off the Democratic and Republican rolls) with an increase in a percentage (the share of voters affiliated with the Libertarian party).Patrick Dixon of Lago Vista, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Texas, told us that’s how the information was presented on the cited online sources. “Maybe I was a little lazy there,” Dixon said. Regardless, he said, the trend is that “our party is growing and theirs are shrinking or growing flat.”In fact, McDonald’s breakdown, shown on a chart in his first May blog post, tracks registrations both by raw numbers and percentages for the two major parties and all minor parties lumped together.Upshot: Based on voter registrations in 29 states that allow voters to declare their party affiliation, the statistics cited by the Libertarian Party are correct.But comparing raw numbers and percentages to make a point, as the Libertarians do, can leave a distorted impression: that the major parties are fading away as the Libertarians gallop ahead. Voter for voter, that’s at least an incomplete characterization.We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/19/libertarian-party-texas/libertarian-party-says-major-parties-have-shed-reg/

Brochure estimates financial impact of Hillsborough transit tax
","After decades of fits and starts, Hillsborough County commissioners agreed to ask voters to consider a 1 percent sales tax increase for expanded bus service, light rail and road improvements. The issue will appear on the November ballot. One question many voters want answered: How much will the new tax cost me? In a brochure outlining how rapid transit can boost the economy and ease traffic congestion, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit says the tax will cost the average family $12 a month. That figure comes from the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization’s long-range transportation plan. It puts the cost of a 1 cent sales tax for the average family at $142 a year, and the average for a single person at $85 a year. The MPO came up with those numbers by plugging the county’s household incomes into the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, available on the agency’s Web site. The IRS developed the calculator because tax rules allow people to deduct either sales taxes paid annually or state income tax from their federal returns, and the calculator enables them to arrive at a reasonable estimate without having to save a basket of receipts. MPO planner Beth Alden said she used average household income rather than median income. “The number we’ve been using is the higher one, just to be more conservative,” she said. The county’s average family of three has a household income of $77,852, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A single household’s average income is $44,832. We plugged those figures into the IRS calculator and it showed the average family would pay $141.83 a year in local sales tax, which currently is 1 percent. A single person would pay $91.50. That’s virtually the same as the MPO estimates. The figure does not include sales taxes on major purchases, such as cars, mobile homes or construction materials for a house. Those are listed separately on tax returns. The county sales tax on items worth more than $5,000 is capped, meaning the maximum amount paid on any single item would be $50. But how accurate is the IRS calculator? Skeptical observers say it spits out a low figure. “It’s in the IRS’ interest to have that on the lower end, obviously, to decrease the deductions,” said Rusty Spoor, a tax accountant at Foley & Lardner. He guessed the calculator could be as much as 30 percent off. Like other tax experts, he noted it’s impossible to determine exactly how much people pay a year in sales taxes without saving receipts, so the IRS calculator is a useful tool. “That’s the best of the poorest options,” he said. “I don’t think that number’s great, but it’s the best starting point.” The calculator is based on spending patterns captured in the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, IRS spokesperson Florida Mike Dobzinski said. That’s the best method for calculating how much people pay in sales tax, according to Frank Williams, chief economist for the Florida Department of Revenue’s Office of Tax Research. “It should be fairly close,” he said. “It may understate it by 2 to 5 percent, but that’s just a gut feel.” Opponents of the sales tax say it will cost residents much more than the MPO estimates. Jim Hosler, a demographer running for Hillsborough County commissioner, initially figured it would cost households nearly $400 a year. He came up with that number by dividing the estimated revenue from the tax — about $174 million, according to the Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations — by 454,000, the approximate number of households in Hillsborough County. That comes about $383. Trouble is, residents aren’t the only ones who pay sales taxes. Tourists, commuters and businesses also pay them. Experts say there’s no way to know exactly who pays what, but most estimate that non-residents bear about 20 percent of the tax burden. Under that calculation, the cost is $307 per household. But that spreads out sales taxes equally among all households, regardless of income. And a household that earns $200,000 a year will pay much more in sales taxes than a $20,000 household, simply by virtue of having more disposable income. Hosler concedes his number may be high. “But their number is definitely a low number,” he said. “The real number is probably somewhere in between.” Clearly there are a number of ways to calculate the figure, and the result for all of them is a somewhat imprecise. Still, our research shows that the number in the brochure is very close to the one provided by the MPO, and HART used a recognized, legitimate source in coming up with the figure. The IRS calculation, while perhaps on the low side, is a recognized standard. So we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/18/hillsborough-area-rapid-transit-hart/brochure-estimates-financial-impact-hillsborough-t/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says job creation in 2010 on pace to eclipse growth during George W. Bush's entire administration
","Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is using employment figures to make a bold comparison between Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.""On the pace that we're on with job creation in the last four months -- if we continue on that pace -- all the leading economists say it is likely that we will -- we will have created more jobs in this year than in the entire Bush Presidency,"" Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Weston, said on FOX News.The comment has continued to spread across the Internet since she spoke back on May 26, 2010.Karl Rove posted a message on Twitter on June 9, 2010, highlighting Wasserman Schultz's quote as ""the new Democratic claim about job creation.""So we wanted to see how it stacks up.The claim, in this case, is pretty straightforward: President Obama is on pace to create more jobs in 2010 than President Bush did in his eight years of office. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is the government agency that keeps the official tally.It posts monthly employment figures, and labor statistics reports are the ones cited in news accounts detailing job growth, job losses and unemployment numbers.Wasserman Schultz's comments came in May, when the BLS had released job employment totals from January through April. Since then, May figures also have been released. In those five months, 982,000 new jobs have been added to the U.S. economy -- or nearly 196,000 new jobs a month. If that growth holds -- and obviously that's an if -- the economy will have added a total of 2.356 million jobs in 2010 (Multiplying 196,400 by 12).That's twice the total job growth during Bush's eight years in office, which were marked by two recessions and generally dismal job growth. Total employment increased just slightly from January 2001 to January 2009 -- by 1.08 million, according to the BLS.So Wasserman Schultz is accurate. In fact, Obama is on a pace to create twice as many jobs in 2010 as Bush did in eight years.But that doesn't mean it's a meaningful statistic.Take, for example, some other accurate statistics we can create using the same figures. All true. And all in seeming contradiction to Wasserman Schultz's claim.Why?Because we cherry-picked numbers to make our point.Just like she did.We asked two economists to examine Wasserman Schultz's claim -- Dean Baker with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research and Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institute. Neither was particularly impressed.""Strictly speaking, Rep. Wasserman Schultz’s claim is credible,"" Burtless said. ""Whether it is a meaningful or useful assessment is another question.""Added Baker: ""This is a silly but true statement."" Later, he called the comparison Wasserman Schultz was attempting to make ""dubious,"" but literally accurate.None of that factors in that more than 400,000 of the new jobs are temporary jobs created to complete the 2010 U.S. Census.Wasserman Schultz gets her numbers right in saying that the U.S. in 2010 is on a pace to add more jobs to the economy than during the eight years George W. Bush was president. But the comparison is misleading because it ignores the job losses in 2009, and compares one year to eight. In fact, you can take the same statistics and reach an entirely different point. Not that we recommend that.

Alabama Congressional candidate Rick Barber's ""Gather your armies"" ad goes viral
","Say this for Alabama candidates, they know how to make political ads that get noticed. The latest ad making a bid to join Dale ""Cowboy"" Peterson and Tim ""Learn It"" James in the Viral Ad Hall of Fame comes from Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber holding a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers -- Sam Adams, George Washington and Ben Franklin, all dressed in period garb. Barber rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The idea is that the Founding Fathers would be appalled to see where things have gone in America. As Barber reaches a fevered pitch, he concludes, ""You gentlemen revolted over a tea tax. A tea tax! Now look at us! Are you with me?"" The kicker comes from the George Washington character, who delivers his response through gritted teeth: ""Gather ... your ... armies."" Enter the national media. David Weigel of the Washington Post weighed in, calling it ""the latest performance art TV ad from Alabama."" Keith Olbermann designated Barber the ""Worst Person in the World,"" and called the ad a treasonous attempt to incite the violent overthrow of the government, for which he hoped Barber would be prosecuted. Conservative radio host G. Gordon Liddy was kinder, but Barber got some harsh treatment from fellow tea party cheerleader Glenn Beck. On his radio show, Beck called Barber, ""one of the dumbest people I have seen."" Ouch. Added Beck, ""What the hell are you thinking? What is wrong with you? ... I know it's been a tough couple of years. It may not be time, yet, to 'Gather your armies.' This Republican is a dope."" Double ouch. Barber insists his ad was not intended to advocate a violent overthrow of the government. ""That couldn't be further from the truth,"" Barber said. ""It's a call to action."" We won't get into that debate, but we did think it was worth assessing some of Barber's claims about the IRS. Here's some of what Barber says in the ad (remember, he's supposedly talking to some Founding Fathers). ""Some of you men owned taverns,"" Barber said. ""Sam, you were a brewer, Mr. President, a distiller. You know how tough it is to run a small business without a tyrannical government on your back.""Today, we have an Internal Revenue Service that enforces what they call 'a progressive income tax.' You'll love this: Every year, if not every quarter, we're basically required to spy on ourselves -- report what we earn, who we hire and fire, with an all-powerful separate court system. Without representation, they can increase taxes, impose costly regulation or conduct malicious audits. ""Now this same IRS is going to force us to buy health insurance. Cram it down our throats, or else. Now I took a took an oath to defend that with my life [points at copy of Constitution] and I can't stand by while these evils are perpetrated."" Let's start with the claim that ""without representation, they (the IRS) can increase taxes, impose costly regulation or conduct malicious audits."" The IRS has does not have the statutory authority to increase taxes. That's entirely up to Congress. We'll cite that Constitution Barber poked in the ad. Section 8 begins, ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes ..."" And Amendment 16, ratified in 1913, lays out Congress' ability to levy income taxes: ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."" So it's Congress that controls whether to increase taxes. We spoke to Barber, and he said some people are taking the ad way too literally. ""Some pieces of that ad are metaphorically speaking,"" Barber said. Barber said that when he said that ""without representation"" the IRS ""can increase taxes,"" he meant that our elected leaders in Washington are not ""properly representing their constituents."" ""Unfortunately we don't have good representation in office that listens to the voice of the people,"" Barber said. For the record, Barber explained, he's not opposed to taxes. Rather, he's in favor of a ""Fair Tax."" Under that plan, all federal income taxes would be replaced with a consumption tax on retail sales. But we think it's disingenuous for Barber to hide behind a claim that his ad is meant figuratively. How else can one interpret a claim that ""without representation,"" the IRS can increase taxes? The IRS doesn't increase taxes. Congress does. You may not agree with what legislators have done with the tax codes, but legislators are duly-elected representatives. It's also misleading for Barber to claim ""this same IRS is going to force us to buy health insurance."" Congress is the body that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And the bill establishes that in 2013, there will be a penalty for those who are deemed to be able to afford insurance, but choose not to. The mechanism for enforcing the policy is the tax code. The full penalty will be phased in over several years, but according to a Kaiser Family Foundation summary of the law, it will ultimately come to ""those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5 percent of household income."" The IRS, of course, would enforce those tax penalties. Because people could opt to simply pay the tax penalty and refuse to buy insurance, there is some debate over whether it's correct to say that people will be ""forced"" to buy health insurance. We think many people would reasonably describe a tax penalty as a mandate. But it would be wrong to suggest the IRS is the one requiring people to buy insurance. To the extent insurance will be required, that was a decision of a duly-elected Congress. Lastly, we take issue with Barber's comment that the Founding Fathers revolted against the British over a tea tax. We'll let Robert Middlekauff, a professor emeritus of colonial and early United States history at the University of California, Berkeley, take it from here. ""The issues that divided Americans and the British government were far more complicated than the tax levied on tea,"" said Middlekauff, who has written several books on early American history. ""The Americans insisted from the Stamp Act crisis on that a free people could be taxed only with their own consent, and only their own representatives could give it. They were not represented in Parliament, and could not be, given the character of that body and the problems of representation in an empire. ... There were other related uses involving the British use of troops against the colonies, the corruption of imperial officials, and the essential rights of Americans."" Barber said he was constricted by the limits of a 60-second commercial. ""It's such a short period of time to try to give a history of how the American Revolution started,"" Barber said. ""You only get 60 seconds to get your message out, to start a discussion,"" he said. There's no doubt Barber's ad has started a discussion. As of press time, ad was viewed more than 252,000 times on YouTube. That doesn't yet put the ad in the same league as the ones from Alabama candidates Dale Peterson (1.6 million views) or Tim James (nearly 1 million views). But give it time. We have no doubt that the Founding Fathers would be displeased if things had gotten to the point where ""without representation,"" the IRS could increase taxes. But it can't. The tax codes, complicated as they may be, unfair as they may seem to some, were voted on and approved by duly-elected legislators. That's the very definition of representation. Call it figurative or metaphorical language, the bottom line is the statement is flat-out wrong. And we suspect the Founding Fathers wouldn't like being misled. We rule Barber's statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jun/18/rick-barber/alabama-congressional-candidate-rick-barbers-gathe/
"['Immigration', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
Dewhurst says Phoenix has more kidnappings than any other city in the world except for Mexico City
","
Curbing illegal immigration was a leading war cry of the Republican Party of Texas convention in Dallas last weekend, and party leaders repeatedly rallied delegates by commiserating with Arizona, which has come under fire for its law that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime. 
Critics say the new law invites racial profiling. Defenders say it's needed because the federal government isn't securing the U.S.-Mexico border. Joining that chorus, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told conventioneers Friday that ""Phoenix, Arizona, I'm told, is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City. That's unacceptable in America. We understand. We in Texas understand the frustrations people feel in Arizona."" 
Play a round of golf, good chance you'll be kidnapped? That's a scary prospect, and ripe material for the Truth-O-Meter. 
One thing's for sure: Many media outlets could have ""told"" Dewhurst that Phoenix ranks second in kidnapping incidents worldwide. Mike Walz, a spokesman for Dewhurst's campaign, sent us eight news stories noting Phoenix's nickname, plus two opinion columns and a blog post. 
Far as we could tell, ABC News broke the story, reporting on a Feb. 11, 2009, that: ""Phoenix, Arizona, has become the kidnapping capital of America, with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone."" 
Several news organizations then reported the information, including the Associated Press, The Arizona Republic and United Press International; some media outlets attributed the news to ABC, others just said Phoenix was ""known as"" the No. 2 kidnapping capital. The Los Angeles Times more specifically reported that Phoenix ""police received 366 kidnapping-for-ransom reports"" in 2008 and that they estimate ""twice that number go unreported,"" according to a Feb. 12, 2009, article. 
A quick online search shows that Dewhurst has at least a dozen news accounts backing up his claim, but there's a hitch: None of the stories says how the kidnapping ranking was reached. Also, while all the stories specify the number of kidnappings that have occurred in Phoenix since 2008, none says how many kidnappings were reported in other cities. 
We asked ABC to elaborate on its report, a request that didn't immediately yield supporting evidence. Meantime, we kept digging. 
Neither the FBI nor the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that serves as the United States' representative to Interpol, could confirm that Phoenix has the second-highest frequency of kidnapping cases worldwide. LaTonya Miller, an Interpol spokeswoman, said the agency doesn't track local kidnapping rates. An FBI spokeswoman, Denise Ballew, suggested we call city police departments to compile a kidnapping count since unlike local authorities, the bureau tracks kidnappings that result in someone being taken from one jurisdiction to another, such as across state lines. 
Short of the time we'd need to call authorities in every medium- to big-size city in the world, we contacted Daniel Johnson, an overseas kidnapping operations consultant at ASI Global, a Houston-based company that coaches clients through kidnappings. You read that right: Say an insured family travels to Bulgaria and the father is kidnapped for ransom; ASI Global will deploy to Bulgaria to help the family negotiate with the abductor. 
Johnson said: ""From our internal experience in the last year, Mexico by far has been the biggest location for kidnappings"" followed by Honduras, Venezuela, Nigeria and the Philippines. The company has handled domestic cases but Thompson said they don't compare in volume to overseas incidents. Thompson said the company annually dispatches a consultant to handle about 50 to 100 cases a year. Mexico City, Caracas, Venezuela, and Tegucigalpa, Honduras are the three cities where they work on the most kidnapping cases, he said. 
Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company, separately chimed in: ""According to our analysts, there is no way that Phoenix is the No. 2 city in the world for kidnapping and there are significantly more kidnappings in many other cities throughout Latin America,"" he said. ""San Salvador, Guatemala City, Bogota as well as several cities in Mexico certainly have higher kidnapping rates than Phoenix."" 
That said, Stewart said Stratfor doesn't track such kidnapping statistics, noting that it's ""extremely difficult to measure given the fact that so many cases go unreported and that the record keeping in many of the most effected countries is inaccurate."" The company bases its information on ""intelligence that we gather through our network of human and open sources, as well as the experience of our analysts,"" he said. 
Johnson also said that generally, the problem with kidnapping statistics is there's ""no reliable empirical data"" and kidnappings are ""inherently under-reported, anyway."" Kidnappers nab someone and tell you not to tell the police, he said, adding that especially outside the United States, people typically don't report the incidents to law enforcement. 
Among countries that track kidnappings, Johnson said, the definition of ""kidnap"" varies. An ""express kidnapping,"" for instance, can be classified as a prolonged robbery, he said. Someone takes to you against your will from ATM to ATM until your checking account is depleted. Robbery or kidnapping? 
Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a public information officer at the Phoenix Police Department, also said kidnappings are under-reported. ""Herein lies the problem with the numbers,"" Thompson said. ""Does Bogota, Colombia, keep records? Does Mogadishu, (Somalia), keep records? Does Houston, Texas, keep records? Does Austin keep records?"" 
He said Phoenix has been dealing with the issue for several years now, and the number of reported kidnappings have actually decreased since this story broke in 2009. There were 358 reported kidnappings in 2008 (10 fewer than reported by the LA Times, due to later reclassification of the crimes), 318 in 2009 and there were 105 from January through May 2010, he said, putting the city on track to sustain less than 300 this year. 
Mindful that ""spillover violence"" from Mexico has become a politically-charged term in the U.S., Thompson said almost everyone who is kidnapped in Phoenix is involved in criminal activities such as illegal border crossings and the drug trade. ""Unless you're involved in the dope trade, there's a very very slim chance"" that you'll be kidnapped, he said. 
""Everyone wants to tie it to their political agenda,"" Thompson said. ""Again, the two overwhelming questions are, do they keep records elsewhere in the world and are there more people — other agencies — across the nation who are even willing to talk about such a problem?"" 
""It was the media that said 'second in the world only to Mexico City,' and it was basically because we were open enough to say that we have an issue with kidnappings and not try to hide it,"" Thompson said. 
Summing up: ""Kidnapping capital"" turns out to be a headline-grabbing label; no wonder it caught Dewhurst's attention. Still, it's incumbent on him — and news organizations bandying the No. 2 description — to check it out. So far, we've seen no evidence that it's accurate, or even close. 
Phoenix has experienced hundreds of kidnappings over the past few years. However, we couldn't find reliable around-the-planet evidence to confirm that only Mexico City experiences more of them. In fact, experts advise that such rankings can't be made based on available information. If they could, they speculate, other cities would prove to have more kidnappings than Arizona's capital. 
Punch line: Nothing confirms Phoenix as No. 2 in kidnappings worldwide. We'll revisit this turf if compelling evidence surfaces, but for now Dewhurst's statement is False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/18/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-phoenix-has-more-kidnappings-any-oth/

Obama speech used to attack Democratic candidate
","What's the best way for someone to undermine a Democrat in a primary campaign? A video clip of Barack Obama bashing the candidate is a good start.Someone who is apparently not a fan of Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, a Democratic gubernatorial contender, created a professional-looking YouTube video attacking him. It begins with a picture of Baker with the ""Ghostbusters"" symbol. ""Thurbert Baker for Governor?"" reads the headline on the video, created June 10.Baker's position in the controversial Genarlow Wilson case is the focus of the three-minute video posted by ""concernedcitizen4u"". The video also includes civil rights stalwarts the Revs. Joseph Lowery and Al Sharpton taking Baker to task.Baker is in a crowded Democratic field seeking that party's nomination to become the state's next leader. To win, or at least get in a runoff, a Democratic candidate must capture a significant portion of the state's African-American vote. Blacks make up about half the Democratic voter base in Georgia.Baker is black. The other leading Democratic candidates are white.Whoever posted the video -- and at this point that person or political campaign remains unknown -- apparently is trying to undermine Baker's support in the black community by using a 3-year-old statement by the man who is now president of the United States. Then-candidate Obama assailed Baker for pursuing the case against Wilson, who is also black.This is a stealth political attack at its lethal best. Brutally blunt, it focuses on a target audience and is virtually untraceable.  But is it true?The Baker camp said no.""This isn't the first time a false attack has been spread anonymously ... and it won't be the last,"" Baker campaign manager Jeff DiSantis said. ""It's a pack of lies.""Wilson, you may remember, was convicted in 2005 of felony aggravated child molestation for what he said was consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl. Wilson was 17 at the time of the incident and faced 10 years in prison after he was convicted. Some activists suggested prosecutors treated Wilson harshly because he is black. The accusations of racial discrimination, added to a story about sex, generated national news coverage.In 2006, the state Legislature changed the law to make similar acts between teens a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 12 months in prison. The changes, however, did not apply to Wilson and anyone else already imprisoned on such charges. So he remained in prison.Not fair, Obama said.The Democrat referred to the Wilson case in several speeches in 2007 during his run for president. Obama compared Wilson's case to I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, the former chief of staff to Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. President George W. Bush decided to commute Libby's sentence after he was convicted of perjury and obstruction in a CIA leak case.""You've got Scooter Libby not serving any jail time. But you've got a young man, a football player who didn't even commit a felony, who's being locked up for 10 years, then it's harder for you to say you stand up for justice in America,"" Obama said in one campaign speech that was recorded.The crowd cheered.The video ends with audio replaying some of Obama's speech.""It's harder for you to say you stand for justice in America.""Video of the future president questioning your commitment to justice can't be good for Baker in a Democratic primary.The video does not say when Obama's remarks were recorded. But an Atlanta Journal-Constitution account of Obama's visit to Atlanta in August 2007 said he made comments about Libby and Wilson at that time. There's one problem with Obama's comments. State law 16-6-4 said at the time of Wilson's conviction that aggravated child molestation was a felony.Monroe County Superior Court Judge Thomas H. Wilson (no relation to Genarlow) ruled in June 2007 that the case was a misdemeanor and that Genarlow Wilson should be freed. Baker appealed the ruling, saying Judge Wilson overstepped his authority. The attorney general said at the time he was worried the ruling had the potential to allow other convicted child molesters to be freed. Baker was quoted in the AJC as saying he thought the 10-year sentence was ""harsh.""But, Baker also said: ""I took an oath to uphold the laws of this state. And in taking that oath, I don't have the luxury of taking the law into my own hands or picking which cases to defend.""   The Georgia Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in October 2007 that Genarlow Wilson should be freed.We tried to reach ""concernedcitizen4u"", but our efforts have been unsuccessful.People who watch the video may get the wrong impression about the case. Wilson was indeed convicted of a felony. So Obama's comments about the case in 2007 were incorrect. We believe the video is misleading and rule that this item is False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/18/concernedcitizen4u/video-uses-obama-speech-attack-baker/

Obama blames MMS for being captive to oil industry
","In his June 15, 2010, Oval Office address responding to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama touched on the dysfunctional record of the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department office responsible for both collecting revenues from resource extraction on federal property and regulating drilling companies on those lands.""One place we’ve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the Minerals Management Service,"" Obama said. ""Over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves. At this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight. Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations.""We decided to focus on Obama's claim that ""oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations.""To analyze this statement, we decided to break it down into three parts.• Did oil companies offer ""gifts and favors"" to regulators? There's ample evidence that they did, at least in one Gulf coast office that was investigated. The most recent report of the Interior Department's Inspector General, released on May 25, 2010, found that employees of oil companies regulated by MMS footed the bill for a wide range of perks for employees of MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office. These included hunting and fishing trips; football games; and lunches. In a number of cases, the IG report named specific employees who acknowledged receiving gifts. This year's report followed a series of other IG reports that found a pattern of ethical violations -- including MMS employees' acceptance of free travel, sports tickets and ski outings -- in the agency's royalty-in-kind office. That office oversaw the collection of royalties from oil companies but did not do the kind of industry safety and environmental regulation that Obama was referring to in his Oval Office speech.Either way, this claim by the president seems to be based on solid evidence.• Were oil companies ""essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections""? There's also evidence that this happened, from testimony before a joint hearing conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard and the MMS after the spill began.In an account of the hearings, the Washington Post reported that the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that caught fire and sunk ""was registered in the Marshall Islands, a Pacific archipelago that like many jurisdictions, authorizes private organizations such as ... Det Norske Veritas to inspect vessels that operate under its flag. The owners of the oil rigs decide which of those organizations to hire, and they pay for the services.""The Post reported that when Thomas F. Heinan, deputy commissioner of maritime affairs for the Marshall Islands, was asked whether that arrangement presented a conflict of interest, he answered, ""In some persons' minds it might, but it's been a long-standing facility that's been in place for years.""The Post also reported that Coast Guard Capt. Verne B. Gifford testified that while the U.S. Coast Guard inspects oil rigs, ""it relies on the private inspectors to do the bulk of the work"" when those rigs are foreign-flagged. For those platforms, Gifford testified, the Coast Guard ""goes onboard the vessel just to verify,"" a process that ""usually takes maybe four to eight hours,"" the Post reported.This addresses inspections overseen by the Coast Guard, but there's also evidence -- somewhat less solid -- that something similar may have been happening with MMS, which was the main target of the president's comments.The IG report on MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office said that a confidential source ""told investigators that some MMS inspectors had allowed oil and gas production company personnel located on the platform to fill out inspection forms. The forms would then be completed or signed by the inspector and turned in for review. According to the source, operating company personnel completed the inspection forms using pencils, and MMS inspectors would write on top of the pencil in ink and turn in the completed form.""But while the confidential source's allegation was credible enough to include in the report, the IG's office stopped short of confirming the allegation, saying that their investigation of the original forms failed to assure them that the over-writing they found stemmed from fraudulent actions.• Were oil companies allowed to write their own regulations? This one is the murkiest of the three.In a May 10, 2010, article for McClatchy Newspapers, reporters Les Blumenthal and Erika Bolstad wrote that nearly 100 standards put together by the American Petroleum Institute -- the oil industry's trade group -- have made their way into federal offshore operating regulations. When we asked Blumenthal and Bolstad for their original source, they pointed us to a Jan 11, 2010, issue of the Federal Register.The Register -- the official daily listing of notices from federal agencies -- reported that the MMS ""is incorporating by reference the Eleventh Edition of the American Petroleum Institute's Specification for Subsurface Safety Valve Equipment (API Spec 14A) into its regulations."" It went on to explain that ""we currently incorporate by reference 97 private sector consensus standards into the offshore operating regulations.""We asked experts in federal regulation whether this sort of industry-agency collaboration was unusual, and whether it supported the president's assertion that the petroleum industry was writing its own regulations.James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that this sort of technical standards-writing ""happens all the time."" ""It is quite common for regulatory agencies to adopt standards drafted, or already in use, in the private sector,"" he said. ""It is especially common in very technical areas where specific expertise in the technologies involved is needed. Agencies, of course, should be wary of self-serving or anti-competitive provisions in such standards, and should use their own judgment in adopting them. But that doesn’t make the use of such standards generally inappropriate.""Cynthia R. Farina, a Cornell University law professor and the principal investigator for the Cornell eRulemaking Initiative, agreed, saying, ""It's not unheard of for agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards for the content of federal regulation.""It's also worth noting that the API's standards weren't slipped into federal rules at midnight in some smoke-filled room. The proposed rule was published on June 12, 2008, and for the next two months, the public had an opportunity to comment. Farina added that the regulation in question was put into place using a process that requires the Interior Department to consult with a variety of other government entities.As it turns out, only two entities did offer comments on this rule -- Baker Oil Tools and the Offshore Operators Committee. Farina calls this ""a huge problem with rulemaking in general. Certainly the absence of comments from environmentalists and neutral researchers in the area would exacerbate concerns about industry 'writing its own regulations.'""Still, MMS can't be blamed for poor response to its call for comments. That's why we think that while Obama was on solid ground with his accusations that MMS regulators were ""showered ... with gifts and favors"" and that oil companies ""were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections,"" the notion that industry wrote its own regulations is not a slam-dunk. While Obama is technically correct that the oil industry did in several dozen cases ""write their own regulations,"" our experts agreed that industry/regulator collaboration is common across federal agencies, at least for technical matters, and that it was done in an open way that included the opportunity for public comment. As a whole, then, we rate the president's comment Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/17/barack-obama/obama-blames-mms-being-captive-oil-industry/

DeMint says 94 percent of bills are passed unanimously
","EDITOR'S NOTE: On June 17, 2010, we rated the statement by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., that ""94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure, and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office."" We said that the actual percentage was 27.9 and called it a Pants on Fire. (We've archived our original item here.) We soon received a number of letters from readers critical of the math we had used to come up with the percentage. We also received criticism from DeMint's office, for our math as well as for other issues. As a result, we decided to assign a new reporter to the item in order to take a fresh look. Below is our new analysis.  On May 26, 2010, Sen. Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, posted a video of one of his speeches on YouTube. Speaking about legislative openness, DeMint said that Congress is plagued with secrecy and lack of debate on important issues: ""At this point in the Senate, 94 percent of all the bills are passed unanimous consent -- 94 percent. So this is hardly a lack of productivity. And what this means is 94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure, and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office.""  DeMint's number seemed high to us, so we decided to investigate. We see two broad areas to analyze. One is whether the percentage DeMint cites is accurate. The other is whether DeMint's percentage says anything valuable about how the Senate handles legislation.  We asked DeMint's office for the source of his claim and were told it comes from a July 2008 report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm for Congress. The report, which DeMint's office had originally asked CRS to prepare, notes that as of June 30, 2008, the Senate had passed 911 measures of various kinds during the 110th Congress.   Of these measures, 855 were passed via unanimous consent -- an expedited process by which bills are passed unless a senator objects. This is the source of DeMint's 94 percent figure -- 855 bills passed by unanimous consent out of 911 total measures taken up.   DeMint in his speech referred to all of these measures as ""bills."" But the CRS report broke them down more precisely. Some were formal bills or joint resolutions, both of which are binding. Others were simple resolutions or concurrent resolutions, which do not have the force of a law and do not require the president's signature.  Of the 911 total measures, only 376 were legally binding bills and joint resolutions, according to the CRS report. The rest were simple and concurrent resolutions. Occasionally these non-binding resolutions inspire some controversy, but a look through the full list provided by CRS confirms that the vast majority are ceremonial or symbolic in nature. An example is a resolution ""congratulating Charles County, Maryland, on the occasion of its 350th anniversary."" Others from the CRS report include: • A resolution commending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln women's volleyball team for winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Women's Volleyball Championship. • A concurrent resolution honoring the memory of Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi. • A concurrent resolution authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run.In making his calculation, the senator decided to include all measures, regardless of whether they were binding. But there's another way to do it: Remove from the calculation the measures that most people would agree don't require debate. DeMint spokesman Wesley Denton argues that DeMint was on solid ground calculating the numbers his way.  ""Nowhere in DeMint’s speech does he ever say that all 94 percent of these bills are controversial, or that all 94 percent need a roll call vote,"" Denton said. ""DeMint is criticizing the process, not every bill passed by that flawed process. So to try to whittle down the number by focusing on only the bills PolitiFact finds controversial is a disingenuous attempt to discredit DeMint’s factual statement.""   We disagree. We think the fairer test is to focus on the bills that include some element of substance that demands debate.  Doing it DeMint's way, in our view, essentially stacks the deck by enlarging the pool of undebated measures to include simple and concurrent resolutions. The CRS report does not consider them bills, and no one seriously expects the Senate to spend time debating the merits of whether to honor a college volleyball team or to praise the life of a late vintner through non-binding resolutions. So why should we pretend that all 911 measures deserve official debate -- which is what would be required to produce the 94 percent figure DeMint cites?   We'll take the alternate approach. We started with the 376 legally binding measures (that is, the bills and joint resolutions). Then we looked closer.  Of the 376, 88 were naming bills for U.S. Postal Service facilities -- legislation that, while legally binding, is almost always non-controversial and treated as pro-forma business by the House and the Senate. According to CRS, all of the naming bills passed by unanimous consent. Because these bills are not the kinds of measures requiring substantive debate, we'll subtract them.  That gets us down to 288 bills. Another 30 passed by unanimous consent re-named a federal building, park, office or highway after someone -- another common category of bill that rarely if ever inspires debate. And four additional bills that were passed by unanimous consent addressed what seem to be non-controversial issues involving U.S. coins.   That leaves 254 bills. We could scrutinize the CRS list for other non-controversial bills passed by unanimous consent, but we'll stop there; once you get beyond common categories like building namings, it gets tricky to determine whether a bill addresses a major, debatable issue just by its title, which is all that CRS lists.  So, stopping here would define our universe of legally binding, non-naming, non-coinage bills at 254.  The CRS study says (and DeMint's original math concurs) that 46 roll call votes and three voice votes were subject to debate in the chamber. If you subtract these 49 bills from the total number of non-trivial, binding bills (254), you get 206 bills passed by unanimous consent.   We now have a couple ways to crunch the numbers. One is to say that 81 percent of non-trivial, binding bills (206 out of 254) were passed by unanimous consent. Alternately, you could separate out the 64 binding resolutions that CRS said were passed by unanimous consent but which received some debate. Doing this would mean that 56 percent of non-trivial, binding bills, received absolutely no debate. (DeMint's office argues that the ""debate"" on these bills cited by CRS was cursory and thus shouldn't be counted as debate.)  Either figure would be lower than what DeMint said on the floor, and one of the percentages is quite a bit lower. They're also higher than the 27.9 percent we had in our previous article, which we now acknowledge is incorrect.  However, we think what's wrong with DeMint's statement is actually broader than the arithmetic. We arrived at the percentages above after first excluding as ceremonial or symbolic 657 measures the senator had counted. These largely non-substantive measures that DeMint included accounted for more than 70 percent of the measures he used in his calculation. This significantly skews the picture of what kinds of measures were taken up in the Senate.  As any veteran Congress-watcher can tell you, the Senate, with its byzantine rules and back-room wheeling-dealing, can be a maddening institution. DeMint's call for reforming procedures and increasing openness likely has merit. His bipartisan efforts with Sens. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to ensure that legislation is disclosed and easily reviewable online prior to passage, and that it be pre-scrutinized for conflicts of interest and budgetary impact, among other things, are the kinds of goals that should be able to garner broad, bipartisan support. At the very least, one can question the wisdom of spending taxpayer money to pass hundreds of symbolic resolutions every two years, rather than debating the great issues at stake.  Indeed, those unfamiliar with Senate procedures might be shocked to learn that even 56 percent of legally binding bills passed the chamber without debate. But DeMint wasn't content to limit himself to such evidence. In making his point, he ran up the score.   Ultimately, we find that DeMint's goals, laudable though they may be, are undercut -- not strengthened -- by the math he chose to present in his floor speech. We'll own up to our own mathematical error, but we stand by our overall judgment from the initial article: Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2010/jun/17/jim-demint/demint-says-94-percent-bills-are-passed-unanimousl/
"['Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Alex Sink']","
Sink says she opposed drilling the 'minute' it was proposed in 09
","Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democratic candidate for governor, has been a vocal critic of offshore drilling in the aftermath of the Gulf oil spill.In a speech to the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club in Clearwater on June 10, 2010, Sink responded to a question about how she would handle the crisis as governor:""Clearly we are in uncharted territory here because while other parts of the world have been subject to oil spills, and by the way, the minute this proposal for near-beach oil drilling came up, I was against it, and that's why I support a constitutional amendment for the people of Florida to be able to say never will we have drilling within 3 miles of our shore.""We were struck by Sink's claim that she opposed a proposal for near-beach oil drilling ""the minute"" it came up. Did she?It was spring 2009 when a group of Republican lawmakers, in the waning days of Florida's legislative session, advanced a proposal to allow offshore oil drilling in state waters, 3 to 10 miles off Florida's coasts. A bill related to developing a plan to implement oil drilling was proposed on Feb. 26, 2009, but it didn't evolve into an actual push to allow drilling until April 21. That's when state Rep. Dean Cannon advocated for a measure to allow applications to the Florida Cabinet to open up drilling. At Cannon's urging, the House Policy Council passed the bill 17-6 on April 21. The bill represented a reversal of the longstanding ban on oil drilling in state waters. But a massive budget deficit encouraged some lawmakers to support the change, which would have allowed the state to charge $1 million per application. If the Cabinet gave the go-ahead for exploration, companies would have had to post a $500 million bond.Environmentalists protested.""Florida's beaches are our legacy and to put them at risk for a few million dollars makes no sense,"" Eric Draper of the Florida Audubon Society told the Miami Herald. ""One small oil spill could wipe out billions of dollars of economic activities. This is gambling with Florida's future.""U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson tweeted his dismay.""I can't believe some Florida lawmakers might actually be serious about allowing oil drilling within 10 miles offshore,"" he wrote on April 21.So what about Sink? An April 22, 2009, article by the Associated Press quotes Sink as being upset that the issue surfaced so late in the session, but her opposition isn't apparent.""I thought we were supposed to have government in the sunshine, this is government in the middle of the night,"" Sink said. ""We have to have open, rigorous debate, and real time to hear from Florida's citizens about this 11th-hour change that could bring drilling rigs just 3 miles off Florida's coastline in the shallow waters of the Gulf.""Sink spokesman Kyra Jennings pointed us to an April 24 press release in which Sink opposed the proposed bill -- three days after the House Policy Council voted for it.""As Florida’s Chief Financial Officer it is my responsibility to protect the people of Florida and all state owned land, and I take these obligations very seriously,"" Sink wrote. ""That's why I strongly oppose the near-shore drilling legislation, which would threaten Florida’s economy by bringing oil rigs 3 miles off our coast, sanctioning drilling in the shallow waters of the Gulf, and allowing unlimited pipelines to go through sensitive areas up to our beaches. This controversial near-shore drilling bill puts Florida's billion dollar tourism, fishery, and marina-related industries at serious risk, and is not in the best interest of Florida.""As a member of the state Cabinet, Sink's opinion was relevant because the bill would have given the Cabinet authority to accept applications for drilling. Sink was one of many Democratic politicians to voice opposition. On April 27, the House approved HB 1219 on a 70-43 vote, but the Senate put the brakes on it because the issue surfaced near the end of the session. A similar proposal was suggested for the 2010 session, but the April 20 Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion sunk all efforts.Even before the 2009 legislative session, Sink was critical of drilling near Florida's coasts.She joined several Democrats in 2008 responding to Gov. Charlie Crist's comments that oil drilling would reduce gas prices. ""The future is not in destroying our coast,"" she said. ""We need long-term solutions now.''Earlier this year, when Obama sought to lift the federal ban on drilling off Florida's west coast -- which would still keep rigs 125 miles away -- Sink issued this response March 31, 2010:""While I support additional offshore exploration 125 miles from Florida's coasts, I have long been opposed to the near-beach drilling proposal currently in the Florida legislature that puts our tourism economy at risk. Florida depends on our tourism, fishery, and marina industries and having oil rigs in sight, pipes on our beaches and the potential of a spill would threaten our state's economic well-being. It's extremely important to ensure that any drilling will not impact Florida's $65 billion tourism industry or interfere with the important work of Florida's military bases, both of which are vital to our state's economy.""After the Gulf oil spill, she joined other officials in calling for a permanent ban near Florida's shores. ""I have seen the BP oil spill up close, spreading for miles,"" Sink said. ""This evidence proves that near-beach drilling in Florida is a disastrous idea. We must never let oil companies drill just 3 miles off our beaches."" It's clear Sink is opposed to drilling off Florida's coast, but she said in her statement that she opposed the idea ""the minute"" was floated in 2009. In a press release, she spoke out against the proposal three days after the House Policy Council voted for it -- and three days before the full House voted on it. Because she was so specific with her words, we have to be specific, too. Three days after a vote is not ""the minute,"" despite her 2008 opposition. Sen. Nelson tweeted about it that very day. So we rate her claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/17/alex-sink/sink-says-she-opposed-drilling-minute-it-was-propo/

Rick Scott says Arizona law allows police to ask about immigration status
","Arizona's polarizing immigration law has become a divisive issue in the Republican gubernatorial primary, with Rick Scott promising to bring the hard-line legislation to Florida if elected.Scott, a political newcomer from Naples who once oversaw the Columbia/HCA hospital chain, released a television ad last month that heralded his hard-line stance on illegal immigration and scolded his rival, Attorney General Bill McCollum, for his opposition to bringing a similar law to Florida.Critics of the law -- which was signed in its final version by Arizona's Republican governor, Jan Brewer, on April 30, 2010 -- bristled over Scott's portrayal of what he called a ""common-sense"" law enforcement approach. The law makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires law enforcement officials to investigate the immigration status of suspicious persons or risk being sued.In a recent television interview with a South Florida CBS affiliate, Scott defended his position that the legislation doesn't allow law enforcement officers to stop immigrants based on skin color.""No one believes in racial profiling. I clearly don't believe in racial profiling,"" Scott said.""But the Arizona law permits it,"" interjected CBS4 reporter Gary Nelson""Absolutely not,"" Scott countered. ""It says you cannot do that. If you read the Arizona law, what it says is if you are stopped for violating the law and they have a suspicion that you're illegal, they can ask you if you're legal. That's what it says.""PolitiFact has already taken a look at the racial profiling aspect of the law. For this item, we'll analyze whether Scott's summary of the law is accurate and complete.The key part of the law reads, ""For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town in this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation.""We began by looking at whether the wording of the law -- ""for any lawful stop, detention or arrest"" -- is equivalent to Scott's formulation, ""stopped for violating the law.""Not exactly, say the legal experts we consulted, such as Michael M. Hethmon, director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which helped write the Arizona law.Arizona's law allows people to be questioned if they are lawfully stopped or questioned for any reason, whether it's a traffic stop, or a municipal violation like letting your grass grow too tall in a community that requires frequent mowing. And suspects only need be involved in a possible or potential violation, Hethmon said.Karl Manheim, a law professor at Loyola Law School, agreed, saying that Scott's statement doesn't accurately convey the authority law enforcement officers have under the law.""If you are lawfully stopped for any reason, they can demand immigration status,"" he said. He said he doesn't consider Scott's formulation to be false, but rather ""incomplete.""There's a second discrepancy between the law and Scott's explanation. Scott said law enforcement officials ""can ask you if you're legal"" -- but the law uses the word, ""shall,"" which means it isn't really an option, according to our experts.The law states that a person can prove their immigration status by flashing valid identification, such as an Arizona driver license or identification card. It continues, ""Any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released.""""It is not that 'they can ask,'"" said Jack Chin, a law professor at the University of Arizona. ""It is that they 'shall' make an investigation if practicable when there is reasonable suspicion. It is a requirement, not an authorization.""Scott is not alone -- many political leaders have stumbled over the often-convoluted layers of the Arizona immigration law. And with judicial challenges already underway, it's too soon to say for sure how the law will be carried out in practice. Ultimately, Scott's statement falls short on two counts -- on failing to communicate the full range of violations that could trigger a police stop, and on suggesting that the law gives wider discretion to officers on when it should be enforced. So we find Scott's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-immigration-arizona-status-illegal/

Dewhurst says believe it or not, Republican State Convention bigger than quadrennial national convention
","Warming up for last week’s Republican State Convention in Dallas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst made a Texas-sized boast in a video posted on his campaign Web site Wednesday. “It may be hard to believe, “ Dewhurst said, “but our (Republican) state convention is actually larger than the Republican National Convention.”Getouttahere!Dewhurst’s campaign spokesman, Mike Walz, said in an e-mail that Dewhurst’s calculation was based on comparing the number of delegates and alternates to this June’s state confab and the number of delegates and alternates chosen to attend the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minnesota.First, Walz pointed to About.com and CNN Web posts, both stating there were 2,380 delegates to the party’s national convention. Next, he noted a recent Dallas Morning News article stating 12,000 GOP activists went to the state convention and a Fort Worth Star-Telegram article stating more than 10,000 delegates and alternates were expected.We also asked the Republican Party of Texas about its count of 2010 convention attendees. Spokesman Bryan Preston replied that “we have just under 12,000 delegates & alternates. Add the guests and VIPs and we’ll hit” 15,000 to 16,000 participants.Why so many people? For decades, state party rules have provided one delegate for every 300 votes cast for the Republican nominee in the latest governor’s race, which explains why the biennial gatherings are held in Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio; other cities don’t have halls big enough to cram such crowds into one space.Driven by the ratio, the party’s potential turnout of delegates and alternates surged from nearly 10,000 in 1984 to more than 17,000 in 2004, according to research by Clint Moore of Houston, a longtime member of the party’s Rules Committee. The number of permitted delegates and alternates dipped to 11,500 in 2008 because Gov. Rick Perry saw a drop in his vote haul in 2006 while fending off three major challengers.Does that mean the total delegate count could keep rising election after election, mostly because of population growth?Nope. Delegates voted at last week’s convention to cap delegates at 9,000 starting with the 2012 state convention. The decision ensures that Fort Worth, intended site of the next two conventions, can comfortably serve as host city. The local convention center has a fixed-seat capacity of about 10,500, according to Eric Opiela, a former party executive director just elected to the executive committee.Nevertheless, the Texas delegate count this year far surpasses the 2008 national convention’s count.We wondered if there’s another way to compare the sizes of the state and national gatherings.Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, guided us to a study of the economic impact of the 2008 convention on the host cities, Minneapolis-St. Paul. The study, by the Minneapolis-St. Paul 2008 Host Committee, states that 45,000 “guests” came to the Twin Cities for the four-day gathering, driving more than $150 million in spending. Separately, the Dallas Convention & Visitors Bureau told us the recent state convention delivered a local economic impact of more than $6.3 million.Riggs also noted a news article published in May by the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times stating that 50,000 delegates, protesters and reporters are expected to attend the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa.So how does Dewhurst’s statement shake out?This month’s GOP state convention drew more delegates than the 2008 national convention, but economic and other indicators suggest the national convention ultimately draws more people.Similarly, though Dewhurst’s boast is justified by one measurement, by another it doesn’t add up. We rate his statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2010/jun/17/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-believe-it-or-not-republican-state-c/

Sen. Ted Cruz says the federal government thinks it has ‘authority to regulate our toilet seats’
","
Toilet seats just got political. 
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a constitutional lawyer recently elected to Congress, says they’re an intimate example of federal overreach. 
He name-dropped the familiar fixtures in his March 16, 2013, speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC. 
""We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats,"" he said. 
Does the long arm of the law extend into your bathroom? 
Yes. But some constitutional scholars say that’s too far. 
Plumbing the Constitution 
Cruz, a Republican, is no stranger to the nation’s founding documents. He argued before the U.S. Supreme Court as the solicitor general of Texas and has written more than 80 briefs for the nation’s highest court. 
He might like to flush some of its decisions. 
Here’s what he told his CPAC audience: 
""There's the 10th Amendment, something our omnipotent federal government seems to have forgotten all about. The 10th Amendment provides that the powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states and to the people. 
""How did we get a $16.5 trillion national debt? We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats and our light bulbs. We need to get back to the Constitution."" 
We’ve written plenty about light bulbs (which, yes, are regulated) but hadn’t taken up the question of toilet seats. 
Here’s the thing about toilet seats and the Constitution. The 10th Amendment reserves powers for the states and the people — except those given to the federal government. 
And under current interpretations of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause and 14th Amendment, there’s power to federally regulate toilet seats. (Take that, commode!) 
How? Well, the federal government can regulate consumer products, access to public facilities for people with disabilities and workplace health and safety. 
Thus: 
• The Mine Safety & Health Administration says, ""sanitary toilets shall have an attached toilet seat with a hinged lid and a toilet paper holder together with an adequate supply of toilet tissue."" 
• The Occupational Safety & Health Administration says construction sites with 20 employees or more shall provide ""1 toilet seat and 1 urinal per 40 workers."" 
• The U.S. Access Board requires most restrooms to have at least one ""accessible"" toilet in buildings covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, which means, in part, a toilet seat at a height of 17 inches to 19 inches. Springs to return seats to a lifted position aren’t allowed. 
Those MSHA and OSHA rules? Cruz’s office says the federal government ""has no business regulating such minutia."" 
It could be — and has been — worse. 
Take the Great Horseshoe Seat Scandal of the 1970s. 
The brand-new Occupational Safety & Health Administration — which draws constitutional authority mainly from the Commerce Clause — had decided to implement a variety of voluntary industry standards as law. 
And it turned out that plumbers had for decades agreed that public toilets should have open-front, elongated seats rather than the closed rings of home bathroom seats. 
(Why? Oh, it’s a matter of speculation that’s made us the laughing-stock of Europe, where experts make jokes that the chief of one American lab was too polite to repeat. But it might have something to do with, um, hygiene.) 
So businesses suddenly faced a federal mandate on seat shape. The ""resultant outcries about picayune government regulations,"" as one newspaper columnist put it, helped land hundreds of OSHA regulations on a to-delete list. 
The shape of your public toilet seat was no longer federally regulated by the ‘80s. 
Plumbing fixtures now generally don’t face federal regulation. Instead, manufacturers follow voluntary industry standards, which often get the force of law from state and local governments. 
But they could. 
Commodes and the Commerce Clause 
Meanwhile, the regulations that yet exist — about workplace seat availability and public restroom seat height — strike Cruz as ""regulating down to the minutia"" on issues best left to states and local governments, said his press secretary, Catherine Frazier. 
He’s right that the federal government ""thinks"" it has that authority, according to constitutional scholars we consulted. 
Cruz’s former constitutional law professor at Harvard, Laurence Tribe, offered some examples where toilet seats are ""obviously subject to federal regulation"" under settled law: 
• The commercial sale of toilet seats, like other commodities, in transactions involving an interstate market are subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause. 
• The provision of adequate toilet facilities to workers in businesses affecting interstate commerce is subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. 
• Ensuring that toilet facilities, like others, are made available without regard to race or disability is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause and equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. 
The question of whether the Constitution should be interpreted to grant such power to the federal government exposes a deep rift among experts. 
Randy Barnett, who represented opponents of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, argues for a narrower Commerce Clause, as do libertarian scholars such as Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute. 
A few decisions since the 1990s have gone their way, including the recent ruling that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate wasn’t justified by the Commerce Clause. The framers ""gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" justices ruled. (The mandate was upheld under the government’s taxing power, instead.) 
But settled law still says toilet seats are fair game. 
""Basically, Cruz is taking an example that sounds silly — toilet seats! — but if you look at the legal basis for the regulatory authority, it's pretty well-established and not all that silly,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ""This is just political posturing, and Cruz, as a Harvard law grad, presumably knows it."" 
Our ruling 
Cruz, railing against modern interpretations of the Commerce Clause and the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, said, ""We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats."" While federal attention to toilet seats has dropped since its brief foray into seat shape in the ‘70s, and now mainly addresses toilet access for workers and height for wheelchair users, Cruz is firmly right that the courts, Congress, and executive agencies claim federal power to regulate them. His toilet trivia is True.

"['National', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Harry Reid']","
Harry Reid says deficit has been reduced by $2.5 trillion in past two years
","
During a recent floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touted his chamber’s role in cutting the deficit. 
""In the last two years,"" he said, ""we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion."" 
This claim struck us as odd, since the annual federal deficit has hovered around $1 trillion for the past three years -- and we knew from all the rhetoric about America’s deficit crisis that we hadn’t suddenly surged into a budget surplus. 
So we checked into it. 
First, some background on the deficit. A ""deficit"" refers to the amount by which spending exceeds revenues. It’s a measure calculated based on one year’s worth of spending and revenues. (The term ""debt"" refers to the cumulative total of all previous deficits, minus all previous surpluses.) 
In fiscal year 2011, the deficit was slightly below $1.3 trillion. By the following year, it had shrunk to less than $1.1 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. And by 2013, the CBO projects a deficit of $845 billion. 
By year’s end, the 2013 figure could end up being higher or lower. The deficit for 2013 could shrink due to across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, which are projected to reduce spending by an additional $85 billion in 2013. And the deficit could shrink further if tax revenues exceed their projected amount (or the deficit could expand if the economy sours and tax revenues don’t meet expectations.) 
But if we allow for some uncertainty, these figures show that the deficit has declined over the past two years by about $455 billion. That’s less than one-fifth of what Reid claimed. 
When we contacted Reid’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a memo written in January 2013 by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Budget Committee. In this memo, Murray uses CBO figures to calculate that the deficit fell by a combined $2.4 trillion due to the two major fiscal deals of the past two years -- the legislation that ended the 2011 debt ceiling standoff and the legislation that avoided the fiscal cliff around New Year’s Day 2013. Murray did not include the sequester cuts in this calculation. (According to Reid’s prepared remarks, he had intended to say $2.4 trillion but actually said $2.5 trillion on the floor.) 
But there are some asterisks included in Murray’s memo that Reid, in his floor speech, skipped over. 
The $2.4 trillion in deficit reductions include projected savings over a 10-year period -- 2013 to 2022. In Washington budget wonkery, this is par for the course -- when bills are being debated, their fiscal impact is usually calculated over the bill’s first 10 years of existence. 
But Reid transformed the memo’s headline number into a claim that ""in the last two years, we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion."" This is problematic for two reasons. 
First, by using the past tense ""reduced,"" Reid implies that these deficit reductions have already taken place. Instead, they would take place in the future -- and there’s no guarantee that they will materialize. 
Second, he said ""in the last two years,"" when in fact the $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction is projected to take place over the next 10 years. 
""I know this is oversimplifying and it doesn’t work this way, but a 10-year deficit reduction averages out to $240 billion per year, or $480 billion over two years,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""That’s a big difference. Because it’s so easy to spin the numbers, precision is critically important in budget items."" 
Our ruling 
Reid said, ""In the last two years, we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion."" 
There has been some deficit reduction in recent years, but Reid's makes it sound much larger than it actually is. The $2.4 trillion number represents a projection of what is expected (but not guaranteed) to happen in the future over a 10-year period. It is not deficit reduction that has already been banked over the past two years. We rate the statement  False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/21/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-deficit-has-been-reduced-25-trilli/

Rick Perry says Houston is home to the most doctors, nurses and researchers in the world
","
Protesters interrupted Gov. Rick Perry at a Washington, D.C. event by calling for the Republican to support Medicaid’s expansion in Texas as encouraged under Obamacare. 
According to video snippets of the Feb. 22, 2013, event posted on YouTube, Perry said at one point the protesters hailed from Alabama. After a protester replied that she was from Houston, another woman rose, saying: ""Excuse me, Mr. Perry, I’m from Houston, Texas, as well,"" before suggesting some Houston women lack health insurance. 
""You know one of the interesting things,"" Perry replied, ""Houston, Texas, is home to more doctors, more nurses, more researchers than any other place in the world--and I'm really proud of what we've done."" 
Is Houston first on the planet all those ways? 
To our inquiry, Perry spokesman Josh Havens said by email the governor was referring to the sprawling Texas Medical Center in Houston, and not to an across-the-board tally of doctors, nurses and researchers in the Bayou City. ""It is the largest medical complex in world,"" Havens wrote. 
Perry did not single out the center in his February remark, though in July 2010, he told a radio host: ""When you think about the medical center in Houston, there are more doctors, nurses, researchers go to work there than any other place in the world, every day."" His comment was recapped in a July 29, 2010, blog post by the liberal-leaning Think Progress. 
In contrast, the medical center has not aired such a precise global claim, though its ""Facts and Figures"" web page refers to the center as ""the largest medical complex in the world"" employing 92,500 people in 54 entities including government agencies and non-profit health-related institutions on an annual total budget of $14 billion. 
Center spokeswomen told us by phone and email that they had no precise counts, or planet-wide comparisons, of its physicians, nurses and researchers, though spokeswoman Lisa Mayes said incomplete results from a 2011 survey indicate that more than 21,773 physicians, nurses and researchers worked at the center that year. Center official Laura Jordan said final results, being compiled, will break out the number of physicians, nurses and researchers. 
Another spokeswoman, Bobbi Gruner, said she doesn’t believe any other medical complex ""remotely compares in the entire world."" In hosting delegations from more than 100 countries and 50 of the largest U.S. cities, Gruner emailed, ""we have found that none have medical assets as concentrated as is the case with the Texas Medical Center. If you look at size alone,"" she said, ""the Texas Medical Center is the 9th largest downtown area in the U.S.  If you look at patient visits, the Texas Medical Center had 7.1 million,"" according to the center’s 2010 survey. In contrast, Gruner noted, Johns Hopkins Medicine, headquartered in Baltimore, says it has more than 2.8 million ""outpatient encounters"" a year, while the Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic reports more than 1.1 million clinic patients a year. 
  
Granted, the Houston center is huge. Still, that alone doesn’t make Houston home to the world’s most doctors, nurses and researchers. 
We did not fare well scouring for independent confirmation of Perry’s statement. 
Spokespeople for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics pointed out that its counts of health care professionals are based on the nation’s metropolitan statistical areas, which can fold in more than one city or county. 
For that reason, we were ready to set them aside. 
But the Greater Houston Partnership, which promotes the Houston-area economy, answered our inquiry by citing the bureau’s analysis. Spokesman Erik Noriega sent a chart drawing on the bureau’s work suggesting the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metro area has the fourth-most individuals (129,930) employed as ""healthcare practitioners and technical occupations,"" a grouping that he said folds in surgeons, doctors, nurses, therapists, medical/clinical technologists and healthcare technicians. The New York (265,020), Los Angeles (206,300) and Chicago (188,340) areas have more workers in the fields, according to the estimates. 
Separately, U.S. Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein guided us to a table in its ""County and City Data Book: 2007"" stating the number of physicians by county for each state in 2004 as well as the ratio of physicians to every 100,000 county residents--a reasonable way of adjusting for population differences. In 2004, the table indicates, Harris County had 11,419 physicians, the fourth-highest total nationally behind California’s Los Angeles County (30,102 physicians); Illinois’s Cook County, home to Chicago (21,189); and New York County (19,849). Separately, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Medical Society, Jennifer Snyder, pointed out that according to the Texas Medical Board,, Harris County had 11,821 physicians as of September 2012. 
Harris County’s 2004 ratio of 314 physicians per 100,000 residents was lower than the ratios in 10 other populous counties, including Bexar County in Texas, home to San Antonio (375). Indeed, eight other Texas counties had more physicians per 100,000 residents than Harris County, according to the bureau’s table. 
Next, the Texas Department of State Health Services provided August 2011 counts of physicians and nurses for five big Texas cities. According to the information emailed by spokeswoman Christine Mann, Houston then had 6,946 physicians, topping Dallas (4,304), San Antonio (3,485), Austin (2,678) and Fort Worth (1,729). 
Mann said nearly 22,000 vocational and registered nurses practiced in Houston at that time, more than in San Antonio (13,491); Dallas (13,100); Fort Worth (7,385); and Austin (7,180). 
We adjusted these totals for each city’s population, as estimated by the census bureau for 2011. By this approach, Dallas had the lowest, or best, ratios of 284 and 93 residents per doctor and nurse, respectively. Austin narrowly bested Houston with 306 local residents per doctor, compared to Houston’s 308, while Houston had the second-lowest ratio of residents per nurse, 98. 
Our attempts to obtain comparative counts of physicians and nurses spanning the globe came up empty. We did not endeavor to compare the number of researchers in Houston against those in other cities. 
Our ruling 
Perry said Houston is ""home to more doctors, more nurses, more researchers than any other place in the world."" 
Perry did not provide nor did we find evidence proving this claim, and there are signs that it’s not supported, including the census table indicating that Harris County ranked fourth nationally in total physicians in 2004 and trailed even more counties, including more than half a dozen in Texas, in physicians per 100,000 residents. Also, while Houston had the most doctors and nurses among five populous Texas cities in 2011, Dallas had greater concentrations of physicians and nurses. 
Finally, there is not yet any confirmation that the Texas Medical Center employs more doctors, nurses and researchers than any other place. That could be. But mights aren’t facts and regardless, Perry specified Houston in his recent statement, not the center.

Chris Christie claims 119,000 private-sector jobs lost during last year of Corzine tenure as governor
","
Jon Corzine may be nearly four years removed from the governor’s office, but that hasn’t stopped Chris Christie from invoking the Democrat’s name when he wants to make a point about how far New Jersey has come since Corzine left government. 
Christie brought up his name in a keynote address on March 6 to the commercial real estate development association at the Sheraton Edison Hotel Raritan Center, where he talked about how many private-sector jobs the state lost during Corzine’s last year in office. 
Christie said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them ""Corzine jobs losses of 2009."" 
Christie’s number is in the ballpark. 
Let’s explain how job gains and losses are measured before we look at the Republican governor’s numbers and whether Corzine is truly to blame for those lost jobs. 
First, we review data that is seasonally adjusted, meaning the data takes into account those jobs that result from seasonal hiring patterns. 
When looking at annual data, we review December over December to get the most accurate picture of employment for that 12-month period. 
Now let’s look at numbers from both the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. 
Both agencies show New Jersey had 3,209,900 private-sector jobs in December 2009. A year prior, the state had 3,325,600 private-sector jobs. That’s a net loss of 115,700 jobs. 
Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed with that figure. 
It’s worth noting that in other fact-checks about private-sector job gains and losses in New Jersey, Christie had cited a figure of 117,000. 
By either measure, Christie’s numbers are off a bit. One reason is that the BLS has ""benchmarked"" its numbers, according to the state Labor Department. 
""Benchmarking at BLS has taken place, which is a backward look at the numbers and adjustments based on newer, fuller data,"" Labor Department spokesman Brian Murray explained in an e-mail. ""It is done annually, and the look back goes anywhere from two years to further back."" 
BLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish confirmed how benchmarking works. 
Next, we need to determine whether Corzine really is to blame for those lost jobs. 
Let’s point out that the first half of 2009 – Corzine’s last year in office – was marked by recession. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit research group, has said the ‘Great Recession’ began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Lingering effects from the economic slowdown, however, have continued. 
Also, as economic experts have told us for previous and similar rulings about private-sector job growth in New Jersey, the governor not only can’t take all the credit for job gains, he can’t pin blame for loss solely on another administration when there are other factors at work. 
Christie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not return a request for comment. 
Our ruling 
Christie said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them ""Corzine jobs losses of 2009."" 
Christie is off a bit, since data from the BLS and state Labor Department show that New Jersey lost 115,700 jobs from December 2008 to 2009 – a period marked by the height of the recession, and something that economic experts have told us cannot be blamed solely on one person. 
Since the governor’s number is off slightly and the claim implies that Corzine is to blame for those job losses, we give Christie a ruling that he’s had before on these types of fact-checks: Half True.

Drew Springer says bag litter increased after San Francisco’s ban
","
Austin’s ban on disposable shopping bags is ""all for show,"" according to freshman state Rep. Drew Springer. 
""In San Francisco, litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban,"" he said in a press release issued March 5, the day he introduced his ""Shopping Bag Freedom Act."" 
Springer, a Republican from the North Texas town of Muenster, said he filed House Bill 2416 to stop Texas cities from ruling that businesses can’t give customers single-use plastic or paper bags. Brownsville, South Padre Island and Fort Stockton also have bag bans, and a Dallas City Council member wants ""to follow in Austin’s footsteps."" 
After Austin’s ban went into effect March 1, 2013, retailers could no longer offer thin, so-called single-use plastic and paper bags at checkout counters. The City Council passed it in 2012, saying the plastic bags, in particular, often end up as litter and are costly to clean up. 
And did bag litter rise after the San Fran ban? 
San Francisco’s 2007 ordinance banning single-use plastic bags at certain stores was the first such U.S. law, according to a March 28, 2007, San Francisco Chronicle news story. In November 2007, large grocery stores had to stop giving out single-use plastic bags; six months later, large chain pharmacies had to comply, the story said. 
Springer’s chief of staff, Travis McCormick, said by email that the lawmaker’s statement was based on the City of San Francisco Street Litter Re-Audit conducted in April-May 2008, which showed that plastic retail bags constituted 0.64 percent of all large litter (items more than 4 square inches). That was a 6.7 percent increase over the 0.6 percent share shown in the city’s April-May 2007 audit, McCormick said, so there was a slight bump in such litter despite the ban. 
San Francisco environmental department spokesman Guillermo Rodriguez told us by phone that retail plastic bag litter dropped the following year. He emailed us the city’s 2009 study, which showed plastic retail bags accounted for 0.52 percent of large litter. 
We looked over the city’s three litter audits, for 2007 through 2009, and here’s the thing: We’re talking about differences of about two plastic bags in each year’s litter samples. 
For the audits, observers counted pieces of litter at more than 100 sites, classified the found items as large or small, then tallied them in dozens of subcategories. 
In 2007, they recorded 23 plastic retail bags and pieces of such bags across all the checked sites. They found 25.5 of the bags and pieces of bags in 2008 -- and 23.5 in 2009. Those counts match up with the percentages McCormick cited and the percentage in the 2009 report. 
About half of San Francisco’s large litter in each audit came from ""fiber materials"" such as paper, cardboard and napkins. 
The ""second-most significant material type"" was plastic, accounting for 20 percent to 24 percent of total large litter in the surveys. In each of the three years, the largest category of plastic was ""miscellaneous,"" accounting for 4.7 percent to 9 percent of all large litter and defined as ""litter that is broken up or weathered such that auditors cannot identify it with certainty but can identify the litter as plastic.""

Rodriguez called the 2009 audit ""a better snapshot"" of the ban’s effects primarily because the 2008 audit was conducted only a few months after the ban started to take effect in November 2007. The 2008 litter audit counted litter samples taken from April 7 to April 18, 2008. That would have been before large pharmacies had to stop giving out disposable plastic bags on May 20, 2008, according to a Chronicle news story published that day. 
Finally, because Springer’s claim referred to ""litter from bags,"" we looked at San Francisco’s total bag data even though the city’s ban did not address paper bags. In contrast, Austin’s City Council banned both plastic and paper bags except for bags considered reusable -- such as ones with handles. 
  
Overall bag litter in San Francisco followed the same pattern as plastic retail bag litter -- rising in 2008 before falling below the 2007 and 2008 levels in 2009 (measured as a percentage of total large litter). Specifically, all paper and plastic bags made up 4.45 percent of large litter in 2007, 5.91 percent in 2008 and 4.22 percent in 2009. That’s a 33 percent increase in 2008; then the 2008 percentage dropped 28.6 percent in 2009. 
  
As of October 2012, San Francisco barred all retailers, large and small, from providing single-use plastic bags, according to other Chronicle news stories and news blog entries. Also, the city began requiring retailers to charge a 10-cent fee for each other bag they give out. Both requirements will apply to restaurants starting in October 2013. 
  
Our ruling 
Springer said San Francisco’s ""litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban"" on plastic bags. 
  
A litter audit conducted before the ban took full effect found two more retail plastic bags than the previous year’s sampling. However, the next audit, launched after the ban had been fully in place for nearly a year, saw a two-bag drop. 
Maybe this means that such litter is decreasing, though we would want more research to reach definitive conclusions. 
We rate this claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/20/drew-springer/drew-springer-says-bag-litter-increased-after-san-/

Michele Bachmann says Alzheimer's disease could be cured if not for government regulation, taxes and lawyers
","
Are bureaucrats, high taxation and trial lawyers keeping America from tackling Alzheimer’s disease? Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said they are during a speech to CPAC, the annual conservative conference. 
After recalling the history of vaccinations against polio, Bachmann said, ""We have another disease ... that's hurting us today. It's called Alzheimer's. ... There is no known treatment for Alzheimer's on the horizon. … Scientists tell us that we could have a cure in 10 years for Alzheimer's, if we'd only put our mind to it. So why aren't we seeking to cure diseases like Alzheimer's, or diabetes, juvenile diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's disease? How did we possibly get to this point of political malpractice? Because our government, proclaiming to care so much, has created a cadre of overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators. That's not caring. It's time we care."" 
We wondered if it was accurate for Bachmann to say that ""scientists tell us that we could have a cure in 10 years for Alzheimer's"" were it not for ""overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators."" So we checked with a variety of Alzheimer’s researchers and policy experts. (Bachmann’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) 
We found a strong consensus among Alzheimer’s disease experts that Bachmann’s factors are either minor obstacles or not obstacles at all. Instead, they cited two primary concerns -- insufficient funding and the complexity of the disease itself. 
First, let’s look at funding. 
""The only thing keeping us from developing successful treatments for Alzheimer's disease is the lack of adequate funding for research from NIH and other federal agencies,"" said Robert A. Stern, a neurologist and neurosurgeon, as well as a director of the Alzheimer's Disease Center at the Boston University School of Medicine. ""That has nothing to do with her naive and scary statements. It only has to do with Congress deciding that it is worth spending money on."" 
We should note that the Obama administration did shift $50 million into Alzheimer’s research for fiscal year 2012 and requested an additional $80 million for fiscal year 2013. It also dedicated nearly $80 million in stimulus money to Alzheimer’s for each of two fiscal years, 2009 and 2010. 
Still, these temporary increases were not built into the ongoing baseline. The baseline level has remained fairly constant since Obama took office, at about $450 million a year. And that amount is due to be cut back this year due to the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. 
""After many years of expansion under the Clinton administration, the budget for the National Institutes of Health has remained relatively stagnant for more than a decade,"" said Deborah E. Barnes, an Alzheimer’s specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. ""This has put the squeeze on scientists. In the past, the top 25 percent to 30 percent of research proposals would receive funding. Now it is the top 5 percent to 10 percent. This means that a lot of really good research is not being funded, and our progress toward finding a cure for Alzheimer's and other important disorders has been slowed. The funding for NIH comes from taxpayer dollars, so excessive taxation is clearly not the problem."" 
  
The other key obstacle our experts cited is the nature of the disease itself. 
If Bachmann is looking for diseases that have been sidetracked by bureaucratic or regulatory hurdles, ""Alzheimer's is about the worst example she could give,"" said R. Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin. 
The disease, she said, ""develops over years from causes still unclear. The real dilemma for Alzheimer's drug trials -- or for trials of any disease that develops slowly with symptoms that may easily be due to other diseases and which may be of varying intensity -- is that there is no form of standard clinical trial that can test interventions and cures within a reasonable time frame."" 
As a result, she said, the FDA has allowed various kinds of abbreviated trials that don’t evaluate progress in slowing or reversing the disease itself. Instead, they track ""surrogate markers"" -- indicators that seem to suggest that a drug is helping. But not all markers translate over time into clinical benefit, she said. 
Such practical challenges have produced a trail of broken hopes. In a 2012 ""setbacks report"" on Alzheimer’s drug research, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the nation’s leading trade group for drugmakers, tallied 101 ""failed"" Alzheimer’s drugs since 1998, with a rate of 34 setbacks for every drug approved. And even the medicines that have won approval have provided symptomatic relief to some patients, rather than actually rolling back the disease itself. 
One might expect PhRMA, one of the most influential pro-business lobbying groups in Washington, to applaud the notion that overzealous regulation, high taxation and aggressive plaintiffs attorneys are curbing the industry’s efforts. But in the case of Alzheimer’s, at least, the ""setbacks report"" doesn’t even touch on those issues. 
So what does the report point to instead? It talks largely about the practical challenges of dealing with a complicated disease. 
""Scientists still do not fully understand the underlying causes and mechanisms of the disease, particularly when it comes to separating potential causes from effects of the disease. This makes selection of viable targets for new medicines very difficult,"" the report says. It adds that ""the limited utility of current models of the human disease is a huge barrier in preclinical testing of drug candidates."" 
The difficulty of finding testable indicators of the disease, the report continues, ""makes it particularly challenging to evaluate, enroll, follow up, and retain patients in clinical studies. Ultimately this leads to long and very expensive clinical trials."" 
Our ruling 
Bachmann said that ""scientists tell us that we could have a cure in 10 years for Alzheimer's"" were it not for ""overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators."" The 10-year goal may or may not be plausible, but if it’s not, there’s wide agreement that the three factors Bachmann mentioned are not the primary obstacles. 
Instead, researchers pointed to stagnant funding and the fact that Alzheimer’s is a particularly tricky disease to research, given its slow and stealthy advances. If Bachmann was looking to score points about bureaucracy and taxation, she has made a particularly poor choice of case study. Bachmann has taken a popular theme and assigned it to a complicated health condition, simply to score political points. The experts say her claim is unfounded. We rate her claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2013/mar/20/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-said-alzheimers-disease-could-be-/

Sarah Palin says D.C. is home to 7 of 10 of the highest-income counties
","Supersize soda in hand, Sarah Palin rallied the CPAC crowd with barbs at ""liberal media folk,"" jokes about President Barack Obama’s background and even a shout of ""You lie!"" Her speech at the annual meeting of conservative activists emphasized the need to rebuild the country -- not the Republican Party -- with an anti-Washington focus.   ""The permanent political class is in permanent campaign mode. So where do we go from here?"" Palin said. ""... At a time when Washington is so powerful that seven of the 10 highest-income counties in the country ring the city, allow yourself to imagine leadership that deigns to understand us little people, us clinging to our God, our guns, our Constitution and the grass roots!""   Palin isn’t the first to cite that statistic about the wealth concentration in the nation’s capital. (PolitiFact Ohio checked it out earlier this year.) Here’s a fresh look.   The statistic comes from the 2011 American Community Survey, a yearly estimate of population characteristics put out by the U.S. Census Bureau.   The data was released last fall, and the Washington Post compiled it into a ""Top 100"" list. Indeed, seven of the top 10 are in the greater Washington, D.C. area:   1 - Loudon County, Va., median income $119,134   2 - Fairfax County, Va., median income $105,797 3 - Arlington County, Va., median income $100,735 5 - Howard County, Md., median income $98,953 7 - Prince William County, Va., median income $95,146 8 - Fauquier County, Va., median income $93,762 10 - Montgomery County, Md., $92,909 So Palin’s claim is on the money. We wondered: What’s making the nation’s capital so well-off?   Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, told PolitiFact some of the factors: ""The D.C. area ranks third in the U.S. in the number of workers per household and second in labor-force participation rate, among the lowest in unemployment, and No. 1 in years completed in school ...  We also work predominantly in professional and business services, and this is what explains this high ranking.""   Salim Furth, senior policy analyst for macroeconomics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, mentioned two other rankings: Washington is third in the country in both millionaires per capita and median gross rent.   ""That seems to me like poor people are getting priced out, and that helps push up your income stats if you can only stay here if you get a great job -- and the federal government gives really great jobs,"" he said.   Those statistics: there are 320,000 federal jobs in the D.C. area, and 55 percent of them pay $100,000 per year or more, he said.   And even though that salary doesn’t go as far as it would in, say, rural Mississippi, ""it doesn’t eat up all of the wage gains,"" Furth said.   Beyond the federal jobs, there are also industries concentrated around Washington because of the government presence, such as lobbyists, the defense industry and federal contractors.   ""There really is a lot of wealth here,"" Furth said. ""There’s definitely a feel of everybody’s wealthy, everybody has nice things. You should dress up nice to go out. Drinks are expensive in a bar. Rent is expensive even if you’re in a crummy neighborhood.""   The ruling   Palin said seven of the 10 wealthiest counties are in greater Washington D.C. The claim is accurate.

"['Ohio', 'Financial Regulation', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sen. Sherrod Brown says taxpayers give big banks advantages that community banks don’t get
","Partisan division may be wide in Washington, but bipartisan work does go on. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown was joined by Senate colleague David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, in working on legislation to address the issue of banks ""too big to fail.""   Looking to prevent future economic collapse and taxpayer-funded bailouts, they have pushed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to detail the annual advantage that such banks continue to receive from the U.S. government.     (Brown, Democrat of Avon, chairs the Senate's Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and has worked for years on the ""too big to fail"" issue. Vitter is ranking member of the Economic Policy Subcommittee of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.)     ""Most Ohioans would be surprised to know that the same Wall Street megabanks which received bailouts from taxpayers in 2009 also receive taxpayer-funded advantages today simply because of their 'too big to fail' status,"" Brown wrote in a newsletter to constituents.     ""This,"" he said, ""gives them access to cheaper funding and more favorable borrowing terms than dependable Main Street institutions, like Huntington Bank or the Peoples Bank in Coldwater, Ohio.""     PolitiFact Ohio admits we were also surprised about the ""taxpayer-funded advantages."" We asked Brown's office for more information.     His press office cited the explicit and implicit guarantee that the megabanks are, in fact, ""too big to fail"" -- and that the government will step in with a taxpayer-funded safety net during a financial emergency.     The expectation of financial markets that megabanks have this government protection against failure is a subsidy that amounts to free insurance, Brown's office said.     Because of this insurance, they said, megabanks can borrow money at lower rates than smaller institutions.     The sources they cited include a study for the International Monetary Fund, which put the borrowing advantage at about 0.8 of a percentage point; the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which says ""too big to fail"" banks enjoy subsidies that may lower their average funding costs a full percentage point relative to smaller competitors; and an analysis by Bloomberg View. Drawing on the IMF research, Bloomberg said the ""taxpayer subsidy"" for the 10 largest U.S. banks amounts to $83 billion a year.     We looked further and found questions about Bloomberg's methodology figuring the size of what it referred to as a subsidy. Determining the size was one of the questions that Brown and Vitter put to the GAO.     While its size may be in question, however, the existence of the implicit ""too big to fail"" guarantee is widely accepted as established fact.     ""Unsecured depositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and regional banks that face the risk of failure,"" Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in Washington in January.     What remains unclear from Brown's citations is whether lower borrowing costs for big banks result in any present-day costs for taxpayers. But PolitiFact Ohio did find an economist who contends that by granting the too-big-to-fail guarantees, the government is ""giving something away of value"" that should be accounted for as lost revenue.     ""Private entities such as insurance companies and hedge funds would charge a fair value for such options,"" said James Thomson, a vice president and financial economist in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. ""But not doing so, the government is forgoing revenues that could be used for other purposes. So yes, the implicit subsidy (or any subsidy) is equivalent to a tax expenditure - like investment tax credits, fair housing credits, and so on.""   Economists don't agree on the size of the guarantee, Thomson said, though researchers including economists at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. claim to have measured it, in addition to the IMF, Dallas Fed and Bloomberg among others..     The most telling testimony about ""Too Big to Fail"" might be that of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to the Senate Banking Committee in February.     Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, pressed Bernanke about the ""free insurance policy"" for the biggest banks, using Bloomberg's figure of $83 billion. Video of the exchange is posted online.     Bernanke readily conceded existence of the implicit guarantee, though he maintained it is built on false expectation.     ""The subsidy is coming because of market expectations that the government would bail out these firms if they failed,"" he said. ""Those expectations are incorrect.... That's the expectation of markets, that doesn't mean that we have to do it.""     ""I understand that we’re all trying to get to the end of 'too big to fail,'"" Warren responded. But until it is ended, she said, ""it is working like an insurance policy. Ordinary folks pay for homeowners insurance. Ordinary folks pay for car insurance. And these big financial institutions are getting cheaper borrowing to the tune of $83 billion in a single year simply because people believe that the government would step in and bail them out. And I’m just saying, if they are getting it, why shouldn’t they pay for it?""     ""I think we should get rid of it,"" Bernanke said.     Finally, we note the final report of the Congressional Oversight Panel on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which said that the six biggest U.S. banks received a total of $1.27 trillion in government support during the financial crisis.     The report notes the moral hazard and ""distortion of the financial marketplace through [TARP's] implicit guarantee of 'too big to fail' banks.""     The report says: ""It is not surprising that markets have assumed that ‘too big to fail’ banks are safer than their ‘small enough to fail’ counterparts. Credit rating agencies continue to adjust the credit ratings of very large banks to reflect their implicit government guarantee. Smaller banks receive no such adjustment, and as a result, they pay more to borrow relative to very large banks.""     The exact value of the ""too big to fail"" guarantee, or risk premium, or free insurance, remains in question -- and it is a question Brown and Vitter put to the Government Accountability Office.     But the biggest banks that received bailouts in 2009 clearly do have a cost advantage in borrowing because of the implicit guarantee. And that advantage is not shared by smaller, community banks. That makes Brown’s statement partially accurate.     However, at PolitiFact, words matter. Even if there is an implicit guarantee, it’s a stretch to call it a taxpayer-funded advantage the banks receive ""today,"" because no money has actually been spent and no dollars change hands. And no money would be spent unless the banks fail. Even then, as Bernanke says, ""that doesn't mean that we have to"" bail them out.     It might seem like a fine line, but there is a difference between a taxpayer-backed advantage and a taxpayer-funded subsidy.     We rate Brown’s statement Half True.  ",/factchecks/2013/mar/20/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-taxpayers-give-big-banks-ad/

Congressman uses trafficking data to push gun control
","
The gun-debate rhetoric has been constant in the months since the Newtown shooting in Connecticut in December. 
Elected officials at every level have pitched gun control proposals, including President Barack Obama, whose $500 million package of gun legislation includes an assault weapons ban and universal background checks for gun buyers. 
Last month, U.S. Rep. Jim Moran talked about Newtown and gun proposals during floor debate about gun violence. In discussing background checks and gun trafficking, Moran urged his fellow lawmakers to ""act responsibly"" and approve some of the gun control measures. 
""In Virginia, we are one of the three states that are the principal source for trafficking of guns. Florida and Georgia are the other two,"" Moran said during a floor discussion of the issues. 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the Peach State, and the other two states, actually held this unfortunate distinction. And what about Texas? With its close proximity to Mexico and that country’s history of illegal gun activity, surely the Lone Star State was high on the gun trafficking list. 
Moran made his comments alongside fellow Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. Speier was shot five times in 1978, while serving as a staff member to then-U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan. The two officials were part of a rescue attempt of constituents from the People’s Temple compound in Jonestown, Guyana. Ryan was killed by gunfire on the mission. 
Moran’s office pointed us to a September 2010 ""Trace the Guns"" report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a self-described coalition of more than 900 U.S. mayors that works to help law enforcement target illegal guns. The study is based on ""crime gun trace data"" from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
According to the report, for the years 2007 through 2009, the states of Florida and Virginia  ranked second or third among all states as the source for recovered firearms used in crimes in other states. Georgia ranked first each of those years, as well as in 2006, when Texas held the third position, beating out Florida. During those four years, nine of the top 10 source states for the trafficked guns -- Georgia, Florida, Virginia, Texas, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and California -- remained the same. In 2009, the top 10 states supplied 49 percent of the crime guns that crossed state lines. 
The study authors note that states with larger populations, like those in the top 10, can be expected to be a source of more crime guns. Controlling for population produces a crime gun ""export rate,"" the number of recovered crime guns purchased in states other than the purchase state, per 100,000 people. 
Using the export rate calculations, state rankings on the trafficking list change. Virginia and Georgia dropped to Nos. 7 and 10, respectively, in 2009, the data year included in the report. Florida ranked 29th, just above the national average. Topping the per capita list were Mississippi, West Virginia and Kentucky, which occupied the top three positions. 
The three states of Virginia, Florida and Georgia, mentioned by Moran, have similarities that influence their gun trafficking rankings, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. 
""Not all gun sales in these states are regulated, the states don’t tend to have any type of regulatory oversight of gun dealers and they are all along the I-95 corridor,"" he said. That interstate corridor, running along the eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, is seen as a pipeline for illegal goods. 
Webster’s center recently completed a book, ""Reducing Gun Violence in America,"" examining the relationship of gun sales regulations and the rate at which guns cross borders into the hands of criminals. 
""There is a lot of profit to be made in the far Northeastern states where the laws are much stricter,"" Webster said. ""A gun that can be bought in these three states at a retail price of $100 can be sold for $400 in New York City,"" he said. 
PolitiFact Georgia also found a 2011 study conducted by Brown University economist Brian Knight that explored the state-to-state flow of illegal firearms in the country and examined the role of state gun regulations. That study, also based on ATF crime gun data, found that guns flow from states with less restrictive gun laws into states with restrictive laws. For example, the report found that the largest firearm suppliers to New York are Florida, Georgia and Virginia. 
Gun control organizations have given the three states that Moran mentions low ratings for their gun laws. On the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence’s 2011 scorecard, Virginia received a 12; Georgia received an 8; Florida got a 3 on a scale to 100 on the strength of the states’ gun laws. Similarly, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave all three states D’s in its 2012 ""Gun Laws Matter"" report grading state gun laws. 
Earlier this month, a U.S. Senate committee passed a bill that makes gun trafficking a federal crime with up to 25 years in prison for people who legally buy guns but give them to others who use them in crimes. And last month, members of both parties in the U.S. House introduced a gun proposal that would increase penalties on the illegal purchase and transportation of guns. 
So what’s the draw? 
U.S. Rep. Jim Moran said that the states of Virginia, Florida and Georgia are the principal source for gun trafficking, and urged his congressional colleagues to pass some of the proposed gun control measures. 
Based on crime gun data recorded by the ATF and cited in several studies and publications, those three states hold the top three spots from 2007 to 2009 for crime guns that are trafficked to other states. In 2006, Texas overtook Florida for the third spot, but Georgia held the top position throughout the four-year period. 
Adjusting for population, Virginia and Georgia still rank in the top 10 gun-exporting states, but Florida drops to No. 29. 
Moran’s statement is accurate but lacks that important detail. Ultimately, the data and experts tie the gun trafficking to states’ gun laws, and these three states have laws that are less restrictive than others surrounding them.

Does the OUS chancellor get lavish house, upscale car and fancy dining at taxpayer expense?
","
Grumbling about the salaries and benefits of public employees is a longtime favorite sport of political observers. 
That was certainly the case following the recent appointment of Melody Rose as interim chancellor of the state’s seven public universities. Rose, who previously served as vice chancellor, replaced George Pernsteiner, who announced his resignation in January. 
Rose faces many challenges as the state revamps its higher education system, and she will apparently be compensated well for her work — too well, according to Keizer resident Gene H. McIntyre. 
In a Feb. 22 guest opinion column for the Keizertimes, McIntyre wrote that ""We will pay (Rose) a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year, and that’s to start, an amount that does not include the costs of this public employee’s benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance, and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar."" 
That got our mouths watering and our minds wondering. Fine dining practically every day? A lavish house and upscale car? (Perhaps journalism was not our true calling?) 
We obtained a copy of Rose’s employment agreement, which shows that she earns an annual base salary of $260,004. 
Rose receives $14,424 in annual medical benefits, the same as other employees in the Chancellor’s Office, according to Di Saunders, spokeswoman for the Oregon University System. 
Rose is not enrolled in the Public Employees Retirement System. Instead, she chose the Optional Retirement Plan, a defined contribution plan created in 1996 for unclassified academic and administrative employees. The university system contributes the maximum $51,000 toward her retirement every year. 
Rose also receives a $12,000 annual car allowance for her to drive to various campuses and meetings. She does not receive mileage reimbursements. 
Then there’s the annual $20,694 she receives ""for professional development and expenses,"" according to her contract. The money is paid to Rose like salary and is considered taxable income, Saunders said. 
The money is intended to cover membership dues for civic clubs, conference fees, and ""appropriate and necessary expenses that might not be eligible for expense reimbursement under OUS policy,"" Saunders wrote in an e-mail. 
""Let’s say there’s somebody coming to speak at a conference, and they take them out to dinner,"" Saunders said. ""It’s things that you wouldn’t want to use your general fund budget for, but they’re expenses a chancellor should take care of."" 
Rose is not required to submit receipts for those expenses, so she could theoretically use all of that money at upscale restaurants. If she spent $100 on each fine-dining meal, she could treat herself to about 207 fancy meals. 
Now about that ""lavish house."" The chancellor is offered Treetops, a mansion adjacent to the University of Oregon in Eugene. The 8,000-square-foot mansion, built in 1911, was the official home of Pernsteiner, who split his time between Eugene and Portland. 
Rose declined to move to Treetops and lives in Portland with her family, Saunders said. 
All told, Rose receives $358,122 annually in salary, benefits and expenses. She’s also entitled to the usual reimbursements for work-related expenses and travel. 
Is Rose’s compensation out of line? Saunders directed us to a 2011 chart on the website of The Chronicle of Higher Education that shows median salaries— not including benefits — of senior college administrators. Administrators at Rose’s level have an overall median salary of $322,700. 
McIntyre based his column on information he had gathered through his years working in education and state government, he said in a phone interview from his Keizer home. McIntyre says he’s a retired language arts and social sciences teacher who served about a decade on the now-defunct Oregon Educational Coordinating Commission, which oversaw the distribution of federal education money. 
""I know people can live very, very well on a lot less money than we’re paying these people,"" he said. ""We have a lot of social problems — a lot of kids are going hungry, a lot of folks have lost their homes — and yet, we continue to pay some of these people just what I’d consider excessive amounts of money."" 
But is it true that Rose receives ""a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year"" and ""benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar"" as McIntyre wrote in his column? 
Rose earns $260,004 in base salary -- not quite the $300,000 McIntyre cites. It’s accurate to say her base salary does not include the $65,424 she gets in medical and retirement benefits. 
McIntyre’s description of Rose’s other perks is partially true: Rose receives a car allowance and an expense account, but she does not live in Treetops and likely isn’t treating herself to fine dining almost every day.

Does the Catholic church provide half of social services in the U.S.?
","
Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press just days after the selection of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina to be the new pope. 
In praising Pope Francis’ ""life of humility,"" Keating said that judging by his selection, the church was poised to focus on caring for the poor and vulnerable. In his remarks, Keating offered a statistic to demonstrate the depth of the church’s commitment to charity. 
""In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church,"" said Keating, who now serves as president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. 
Keating did not return an inquiry for this story, nor did Catholic Charities USA, the largest charitable organization run by the Catholic church. We asked a variety of experts on philanthropy whether they had heard this statistic or knew where it came from, but none did. 
We should start by noting that Catholic charity work is extensive and widely considered a crucial part of the nation’s social safety net. By itself, Catholic Charities USA, has more than 2,500 local agencies that serve 10 million people annually, said Mary L. Gautier, a senior research associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, an institute at Georgetown University that studies the church. 
And Catholic Charities is supplemented by a panoply of other Catholic-affiliated groups, Gautier said, including ""St. Vincent De Paul societies, social justice committees, soup kitchens, food pantries, and other similar programs organized independently by thousands of Catholic parishes each year."" 
For a variety of reasons, it’s difficult to quantify exactly how big Catholic-backed charity is, but we tried our best to sift the data with the help of the National Center for Charitable Statistics, a project of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. 
The first question we asked is whether the sum of all Catholic-sponsored charity amounts to half of all charitable activity by private groups in the United States. We started with the biggest, Catholic Charities USA, then worked outward. 
In 2010, Catholic Charities USA reported expenditures of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which publishes an annual list of the 400 biggest charities in the United States, ranked by the amount of donations they receive. This enabled it to rank near the top of the 400 list, behind two major social-services charities -- the United Way and the Salvation Army, neither of which is affiliated with the Catholic church. 
Meanwhile, Catholic News Service has noted a few other Catholic organizations that made the Chronicle’s annual 400 list, including Father Flanagan Boys Home and Covenant House. This excludes Catholic universities, which mainly provide higher education; hospitals, which are categorized separately from social services; and groups that focus on overseas work. 
Let’s assume that other Catholic groups that didn’t crack the top 400 list spent six times what Catholic Charities USA spent, a multiplier that experts we contacted thought was reasonable. That would make the figure about $26 billion. 
Then if you suppose that the 18,000 Catholic parishes spent an average of $200,000 on the needy every year beyond what they contribute to any of these charitable organizations, a number also considered plausible by our experts, that would add another $3.6 billion to the total. 
All told, this would equal about $30 billion. So how does that slice compare to the entire pie? 
National Center for Charitable Statistics researchers tallied up expenditures by nonprofits in the broad category of ""human services,"" which includes nutrition, employment assistance, legal aid, housing, disaster relief and youth development. In 2010, the most recent year available, they came up with total expenditures of $168 billion in that category. 
So by our estimate, Catholic-affiliated charity amounts to 17 percent of the funds spent by nonprofits on social services -- well short of the 50 percent Keating cited. Even doubling this share to create a generous margin of error brings it to 34 percent -- still well short of half. 
But even this may overestimate the footprint of Catholic-supported charities, since it doesn’t include social-service expenditures by the government. In his comment, Keating didn’t specify that he was only talking about social services funded by private groups. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending on means-tested programs and tax credits totaled $588 billion in 2012, more than triple what the private sector spent. If you factor in federal spending on these programs, the Catholic share shrinks further, to somewhere in the mid-single digits, depending on how generous your estimate is. 
Indeed, the government even foots a notable share of the bill for Catholic charitable work through social service contracts. According to NETWORK, a Catholic social-justice lobbying group, the federal government sent more than $1.5 billion to Catholic organizations over a recent two-year period. In 2012, the Economist reported that 62 percent of Catholic Charities’ support came from local, state and federal government agencies. 
And indirectly, the government maintains a tax exemption for churches and charities, which enables all religious groups to devote more of their funds to charitable work. Taxpayers who itemize can also deduct their donations to charities, including Catholic ones. 
Our ruling 
Keating said, ""In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church."" He’s right that Catholic groups are among the biggest providers of social-service charity in the nation, but it doesn’t appear that they account for half of all such charity. 
We’re admittedly using a bit of guesswork, but Catholic charity seems to account for 17 percent to 34 percent of all nonprofit social-service charity, depending on how generous an estimate you make. And that share drops to single digits once you factor in the money the federal government spends on means-tested programs.

Michele Bachmann says 70 percent of food stamp funding goes to 'bureaucrats'
","
Federal bureaucrats are a favorite target at CPAC, the annual conservative conference that was held March 14-17, 2013. And in her address to the conference, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., served up a doozy. 
How does it help the poor, she asked, when ""of every dollar that you hold in your hands, 70 cents of that dollar that's supposed to go to the poor doesn't. It actually goes to benefit the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Seventy cents on the dollar. That's how the president's caring works in practice. So three dollars in food stamps for the needy, seven dollars in salaries and pensions for the bureaucrats who are supposed to be taking care of the poor. So with all due respect, I ask you, how does this show that our president cares about the poor?"" 
Seventy percent of the food stamp budget goes to bureaucrats rather than beneficiaries? This sounded way off to us. So we looked into it. 
The real numbers 
We first turned to budget data for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the food stamp program. (We should point out that the food stamp program has officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008). 
In 2012, the Food and Nutrition Service spent a little over $112 billion, an amount that includes not only food stamps but also several smaller nutrition programs for low-income Americans. Of this, $136.5 million was spent on administration. That works out to one tenth of 1 percent -- nowhere near 70 percent. 
The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came up with a somewhat larger percentage on administration in a 2012 briefing paper. The center came up with administrative costs of about 5 percent by including several other categories of spending, including state administrative costs and educational programs for SNAP participants. 
Bachmann did mention ""pensions,"" and if you add the retirement costs of SNAP employees it would boost the numbers a bit higher. But even the most generous accounting of SNAP’s administrative costs end up well short of 70 percent. What gives? 
Where Bachmann went wrong 
Bachmann’s office did not answer our inquiry, but experts say she probably got it from The Poverty of Welfare: Helping Others in Civil Society, a 1996 book by Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute. Tanner told PolitiFact that Bachmann is ""misquoting me in a subtle but important way."" 
In his book, Tanner cited a claim by Robert L. Woodson -- president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise and author of Breaking the Poverty Cycle: Private Sector Alternatives to the Welfare State -- that in the 1980s, 70 percent of every dollar went ""not to poor people but to government bureaucrats and others who serve the poor. Few private charities have the bureaucratic overhead and inefficiency of government programs."" 
In a footnote, Tanner added, ""It is important to note that the 70 percent figure is not solely government administrative overhead. That figure also includes government payments to the non-poor on behalf of the poor. For example, Medicaid payments go to doctors. Housing subsidies are frequently paid directly to landlords."" 
So, we see three problems here. 
First, Bachmann’s claim appears to be based on a 17-year-old study that cites data that may be a decade older than that. In an interview, Tanner said he quoted Woodson’s findings and then referenced a number of regional studies that reached similar conclusions. 
Second, the footnote makes clear that not all the people receiving federal anti-poverty money are ""bureaucrats."" 
And third, even if you assume Woodson and Tanner are correct, the finding still doesn’t apply to SNAP, which is a pure cash benefit system without payments made to intermediaries such as doctors or landlords. 
Our ruling 
Bachmann said that of every ""three dollars in food stamps for the needy, seven dollars in salaries and pensions (go to) the bureaucrats who are supposed to be taking care of the poor."" 
That is ridiculously off-base. Even the broadest calculation of administrative costs for SNAP tops out at 5 percent of program costs, far below the 70 percent Bachmann claims. And the scholar behind the statistic she appears to have used as support said Bachmann has misquoted his work.

Rep. Doug Holder's texting-while-driving stat is too high
","
After years of dead ends, Florida lawmakers are again pushing for a law that would penalize motorists who text or email from behind the wheel. 
The measure, SB 52/HB 13, would make texting while driving a secondary offense, so motorists would be fined only on top of a primary offense, such as careless driving or speeding. 
The House sponsor of the bill, Rep. Doug Holder, R-Venice, rattled off several grim statistics about the problem in a March 13 committee hearing. One claim gave us fact-checkers pause. 
""Nearly 25 percent of all automobile accidents are caused by texting while driving,"" he said. 
Holder’s legislative aide directed us to the website TextingAndDrivingSafety.com. We checked that site, as well as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Distraction.org and the National Security Council. We checked in with AAA, which supports Holder’s bill. 
We found interesting research that resemble Holder’s claim on these sites. 
At least 23 percent of all crashes involved cell phones in 2011. 
Texting while driving makes a driver 23 times more likely to crash. 
About 26.2 percent of motorists admitted typing or sending an email while driving in the past month. 
But nowhere did we find an estimate as high as Holder’s for the percentage of crashes caused by texting while driving. 
Reached by phone, Holder acknowledged he messed up his numbers. He said he meant to say ""distracted driving"" instead of ""texting while driving,"" but he got, well, distracted in front of the committee considering his bill. 
""I was not looking at my notes because I was trying to show my passion about it,"" Holder said. 
What else constitutes distracted driving? (As if you don’t know.) There’s talking on the phone and to other passengers, putting on makeup, using a GPS and adjusting music, among other driving vices. 
Texting is by far the worst because it demands a driver’s visual, manual and cognitive attention, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
We were curious what Florida figures were available for crashes caused by texting while driving. Texting caused nearly .1 percent of more than 256,000 crashes in 2012, according to preliminary data collected by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Crashes that resulted from distractions by any electronic communication device comprised 1.79 percent of crashes, or 4,586, in 2012, according to the same state data. 
The real number is likely higher. A committee analysis of HB 13 makes an important point about gathering data in Florida: It’s incomplete. For a crash report to identify texting as the cause of an accident means a motorist has to admit that to an officer. And because it is not an enforceable offense, there is no consistent way for law enforcement officers to enter it into their reports. 
Our ruling 
Holder’s statistic that 25 percent of all crashes are the result of texting at the wheel missed the mark. It would have been more accurate had he said ""distracted driving"" or ""using cell phones."" There’s a grain of truth in that texting is one of the ways a driver can be distracted.

National Association for Gun Rights says Rep. Scott Rigell “wants gun owners in a federal registration system”
","
U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, R-2nd, is being targeted by a pro-gun group for supporting for ""Obama’s gun control.""

The National Association for Gun Rights aired an ad in Hampton Roads earlier this month criticizing Rigell for co-sponsoring legislation that would increase penalties for people who illegally purchase firearms or transport them across state lines.

""Rigell also wants gun owners in a federal registration system,"" the ad said.

We wondered whether Rigell, who boasts a pro-gun background, really has endorsed a federal gun registry. The congressman, in a news release, dismissed the charge as ""laughable.""

The group is headquartered in Fredericksburg and bills itself as the ""fastest growing guns right group in America."" We made three requests to the association for information that would back up its claim about Rigell. No one got back to us. So we poked around on our own.

Let’s start with a little background. The federal government since 1986 has been explicitly forbidden from keeping a registration system connecting most firearms to their owners. Even when Congress passed legislation in 1993 that instituted the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, it did not allow the government to keep information about firearm purchasers in order to build a data base.

In the wake of shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut last December that left 20 children and six teachers dead, President Barack Obama made a series of proposals to strengthen gun laws. One of them calls for expanding background checks, which now apply to people who buy guns from licensed dealers. Obama says people who buy arms from private individuals should also be checked out.

Rigell has said in at least two interviews that he would be willing to consider proposals for expanded or universal background checks.

The National Rifle Association, the most influential of guns rights organizations, claims the president’s support of universal background checks is tantamount to creating a federal registry. The NRA argues that expanding the checks will create a slippery slope that will lead to the registry.

FactCheck.org said in January that ""it’s simply not accurate to suggest that Obama’s plan for universal background checks would result in a massive federal registry."" They pointed out that Congress, since 2004, has inserted language in annual spending bills requiring the FBI to destroy firearm transfer records within 24 hours of approval of the sales.

Obama’s gun control agenda also includes a limit on the number of bullets a magazine can hold, an assault weapons ban and more support for mental health care. But none of the 23 proposals calls for a federal registry.

Some Democratic members of Congress, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, have introduced bills that would create gun registries. Rigell has vowed to oppose the measures. ""As a gun owner, hunter and lifetime member of the NRA, I have not and will not support legislation which establishes in any form a national registry of guns or gun owners,"" he said on Feb. 28.

That’s consistent with a statement Rigell posted on his campaign website in 2010, when he was first elected to Congress. ""Federal licensing of law-abiding gun owners and national gun registration would violate our Second Amendment rights,"" he wrote.

Rigell, as we’ve noted, did co-sponsor a gun bill earlier this year that would increase the federal penalties for straw purchasers -- people who buy weapons for those who cannot pass background checks -- and for runners who transport guns across state lines.

But the bill makes no mention of a federal registry.

Our ruling

The National Association for Gun Rights claims that Rigell wants a national gun registration system. The record shows he has consistently opposed that idea.

The association offers no proof for its claim, which is wrong and inflammatory. It’s only fitting that we set the association’s Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/mar/18/national-association-gun-rights/national-association-gun-rights-says-rep-scott-rig/

No evidence to support claim about threats against Obama
","
He’s the nation’s first African-American president. He’s infuriated many people with his policies on key issues, such as health care and taxes. He’s also a target of terrorists.

Because of some of these factors and others, some say the U.S. Secret Service has handled more death threats against President Barack Obama than anyone who’s sat in the Oval Office.

""The incidents of threats against (Obama) are greater than for any other president in modern times,"" civil rights legend Julian Bond recently said on ""The Colbert Report.""

PolitiFact Georgia  received a request from a reader on Twitter to examine the accuracy of such claims. We tried to reach Bond, but our efforts were unsuccessful. We tried him through the American Program Bureau, a company that has arranged interviews and speeches for Bond. We emailed Bond at American University, where he is an adjunct professor in the School of Public Affairs. We called the university’s communications department, which said it would try to contact Bond for us.

Bond, 73, is the former chairman of the NAACP and a founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He is a  former Atlanta resident and member of the Georgia House of Representatives. Bond has taught college courses and was the narrator of the award-winning ""Eyes on the Prize"" television series about the civil rights movement.

Others have made similar claims about threats to Obama. And they seem to come from a single source.

A U.S. Secret Service spokesman told us the agency does not discuss the number of threats against any president. But the most recent director left some bread crumbs that we followed.

In August 2009, an author who’s written about the Secret Service estimated that the number of threats against Obama had increased by 400 percent in comparison with his White House predecessor, George W. Bush.

But that December, then-Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan told a congressional committee that the number of threats against Obama had not -- again, had not -- increased by 400 percent.

""The threats right now ... is the same level as it has been for the previous two presidents at this point in their administrations,"" Sullivan said.

He told the committee he’d discuss specifics in private. The Secret Service doesn’t like to discuss threats against a president because it doesn’t want copycats to get any ideas.

Sullivan told U.S. News during an interview in March 2010 that the threat level had not increased since Obama became president. Sullivan retired last month.

In 2012, some news outlets reported that there had been a spike in threats against Obama. One report from WLS-TV, an ABC affiliate in Chicago, used the 400 percent increase figure that Sullivan had said was inaccurate. The station later added that it is believed that Obama is the most threatened president in U.S. history. But the report cited no sources.

PolitiFact has occasionally dealt with claims in which the federal government cannot discuss specifics. For example, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., claimed during the 2012 presidential campaign that GOP nominee Mitt Romney went 10 years without paying taxes. Reid said he got the information from a Romney business associate who wished to remain anonymous. Although the Internal Revenue Service can’t release Romney’s taxes without his permission, PolitiFact believed the burden of proof was on Reid since he made such a serious claim and rated it a Pants On Fire!

To recap, Bond said ""the incidents of threats against (Obama) are greater than for any other president in modern times.""

But a former Secret Service director has twice said there has not been an increase. The Secret Service is, well, secret, so they won’t discuss the number of specific threats against Obama.

There’s no concrete evidence that Bond and others have produced to back up their claim.

Southwest Airlines CEO says federal taxes on a flight are 20%, higher than sin and gun taxes
","
On a scale of politically controversial topics, airline tickets might rank near the bottom, perhaps somewhere just above Robert’s Rules of Order and a quorum call.

And yet plane tickets have been part of some curious claims taken on by PolitiFact: 
""Every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you"" -- PolitiFact Texas: Mostly False 
You can use food stamps for a plane ticket to ""go to Hawaii"" -- PolitiFact National: Pants on Fire 
Now coming down the runway is a claim by Gary Kelly, chief executive officer of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. Southwest carries the most domestic passengers in the U.S. and the most passengers at Milwaukee’s Mitchell International Airport.

Kelly made his statement in a column he wrote for the February 2013 issues of the in-flight magazines of Southwest and of AirTran Airways, which Southwest acquired in 2011.

""Taxes and fees amount to about 20 percent of a typical $300 round-trip domestic ticket,"" he stated. ""That’s higher than taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco and firearms.""

With spring break around the corner, and alcohol, tobacco and firearms always in season, let’s see if Kelly’s claim takes flight.

Cost of an airline ticket

Kelly’s opinion column focused on federal taxes on airline tickets and other products. His source for the taxes on an airline ticket is Airlines for America, the trade group that advocates for the airline industry. It spent $6.37 million in federal lobbying in 2012, according to the nonpartisan OpenSecrets.org.

In December 2012, Airlines for America announced details of a campaign it would undertake in 2013 to persuade lawmakers to reduce federal taxes on airlines and take other steps to help the industry.

Just how high are those taxes?

Southwest Airlines spokesman Brad Hawkins used figures provided by Airlines for America to give a breakdown of the four major federal taxes and fees on a ticket with a base price of $300. His example includes one connecting flight each way -- in other words, a ticket that includes two flights on the departure segment of the trip and two flights on the return.
  
Based on Hawkins’ calculations, the $66.10 equals 22 percent of the cost of the $300 ticket, exceeding the 20 percent that Kelly claimed.

As for the size of the taxes and fees, we found a Federal Aviation Administration document confirming the excise tax and segment fee amounts; they help fund the FAA, which coordinates air traffic control and other aspects of the aviation system. (An excise tax is somewhat like a sales tax, in that it is paid on a purchase, but it’s often included in the purchase price.)

Another FAA document confirms the passenger facility charge, which is collected by public agencies that run commercial airports and is used for FAA-approved projects at the airports. And a Transportation Security Administration document confirms the Sept. 11 fee, which helps fund the TSA.

We ran Kelly’s statement and his itinerary by Joakim Karlsson, a researcher with the Airline Ticket Tax Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the project studies ticket taxes and user fees added directly to airline tickets. He called Kelly’s statement ""mathematically correct, but fundamentally misleading.""

Karlsson noted that fares are usually quoted with taxes and fees included. So, a $300 ticket would include a base fare of about $239.

Karlsson calculated that would trigger $61 in taxes and fees, which would still amount to 20 percent of the ticket cost, the same amount Kelly claimed.

But more importantly, Karlsson said, the sample ticket that Kelly uses is not typical: 
So, a $418 non-stop ticket would include $54 in taxes and fees, or just under 15 percent of the total. (The taxes and fees in Kelly’s $300 ticket example, if the trip were non-stop, also would equal just under 15 percent.)

That means the first part of Kelly’s claim is accurate, but leaves out important details.

Taxes and fees on other products

As for the second part of Kelly’s statement, the Southwest Airlines spokesman cited a 2011 opinion column in The Wall Street Journal by the chief executive officer of Airlines for America, the airlines trade group. The column argued that the taxes paid by airlines are at the ""same excessive levels"" as ""sin"" taxes imposed on alcohol, tobacco and gambling.

But the column provided no figures to show how the various tax rates compare.

We found the following figures from the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, a division of the Department of Treasury. They represent only the federal taxes on these products.
  
Some brands of beer cost more than others, some wine costs more in one part of the country than another, buying in bulk costs less, etc.

But, to consider some examples, if a: 
None of this takes into account state and local taxes on the various products, but Kelly’s claim focuses on federal taxes.

So, the tax rate on an airline ticket -- whether it’s 20 percent, as in the example Kelly cited, or the more typical 15 percent as cited by the MIT program -- is generally higher than the federal tax rates on the other products Kelly cited.  

One might argue that taxes and fees on airline tickets, which help fund aviation operations, are fundamentally different from ""sin"" taxes on things like cigarettes, which are meant to hold down consumption. But that’s not an argument central to this claim.

Our rating

Kelly said: ""Taxes and fees amount to about 20 percent of a typical $300 round-trip domestic ticket. That’s higher than taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco and firearms.""

The first part of the claim is technically accurate, but misleading, given that the tax rate on a typical flight -- which costs more than $300 and doesn’t include connecting flights -- is 15 percent. The second part of the claim, although it doesn’t take into account price variations on various products, appears generally accurate.

On balance, since the thrust of the claim was which had more taxes and which had less, we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/17/gary-kelly/southwest-airlines-ceo-says-federal-taxes-flight-a/

Sierra Club's Jeff Tittel claims DEP staffing levels lowest since mid-1980s
","Doing more with less doesn’t always have good results, according to the director of New Jersey’s Sierra Club.

Jeff Tittel made that point in a March 2 opinion column on NJ.com, specifically referencing the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.

""DEP has 2,812 employees, the lowest level since the mid-’80s,"" Tittel wrote, questioning cuts in Gov. Chris Christie’s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget that impact various environmental funds and suggesting that low staffing means fewer people ensuring the state’s air is clean and people are protected from flooding.

Is Tittel right that the state’s environmental arm is reducing staffing at great risk to New Jerseyans?

Not quite.

First, let’s review the number of people on staff at the DEP and how those levels have fluctuated through the years. Then we’ll compare current staffing with levels from the mid-1980s.

Tittel claimed the DEP has 2,812 employees, but that figure is the staffing level proposed for the fiscal year 2014 budget, according to Larry Ragonese, DEP spokesman. Currently, the DEP has 2,734 employees, he said. So Tittel is off by 78 workers.

It’s worth noting that Christie has the final say on the budget and must approve it by June 30. The new fiscal year starts on July 1.

So how is DEP staffing now compared with the mid-1980s?

We asked Ragonese for annual DEP staffing levels from 1970 to present, but since Tittel wasn’t more specific than ""the mid-80s,"" we’ll look at years 1983 through 1987 and compare those with more recent years.",/factchecks/2013/mar/17/jeff-tittel/sierra-clubs-jeff-tittel-claims-dep-staffing-level/
