No, Leonardo DiCaprio didn’t give $10 million to Ukraine
","A picture of actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio is one of many being shared on social media with the claim that he gave $10 million to Ukraine.  ""THANK YOU LEO!!!!"" one post says with several Ukrainian flag emojis.  But the evidence to support this claim is shaky, and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact’s efforts to reach representatives of DiCaprio were not successful. But CNN reporter Daniel Dale tweeted on March 9 that a source close to the actor said DicCaprio didn’t donate $10 million and that he has no relatives from Ukraine. (Some posts online have said his grandmother is from there).  ""DiCaprio stands with Ukraine and did make donations to a variety of humanitarian organizations trying to help Ukraine, the source said, but it wasn't $10 million, wasn't to Ukraine's government or military as some stories said, and wasn't connected to his grandmother,"" Dale tweeted. Journalist Jane Lytvynenko, senior research fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, also pointed out some red flags with the claim. A story that has since been deleted on a blog called ""Polish News"" said that DiCaprio had ""allocated"" $10 million to support Ukraine, citing as a source the International Visegrad Fund, a donor organization based in Slovakia. But a spokesperson for the fund told publications that they weren’t aware of DiCaprio making such a donation.  Several news outlets, including the Independent, published the misinformation and have since corrected their reports. We found no original credible reporting that DiCaprio gave $10 million to Ukraine.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/mar/11/facebook-posts/no-leonardo-dicaprio-didnt-give-10-million-ukraine/

California 'bacon ban' applies to more than pork, aims to prevent animal cruelty
","Republican U.S. Senate and House members from Iowa have voiced opposition against a California proposition that went into effect earlier this year that they claim will ban bacon in the state. Rep. Ashley Hinson recently tweeted about her travels around Iowa speaking to farmers and cattlemen to push back against what she and other Iowa Republican political leaders called a ""bacon ban."" ""Great to catch up with everyone and talk about our efforts to ensure independent cattle producers have fair market access & to push back on California’s bacon ban,"" Hinson tweeted.  California Proposition 12, referred to as the ""bacon ban"" by Hinson and other politicians, requires housing breeding pigs, egg-laying chickens and veal calves in facilities of a certain square footage for animal health reasons. Facilities for breeding pigs would need to provide more than 24 square feet of usable floor space per pig.  The law would ban the sale of pork, egg and veal products from companies whose facilities don’t meet those standards. The law applies to the sale of uncooked pork from animals raised in California and out of state.  Proposition 12 was put on California’s ballot on Nov. 6, 2018, and passed with roughly 62% of the vote. The law amends requirements in parts of Chapter 13.8 of the state’s Health and Safety Code. It adds Proposition 2, a law that involved prevents animal cruelty that passed in 2008.  Parts of the law were phased in, with the part covering requirements for pigs taking effect on Jan. 1, 2022. However, a Sacramento County judge ruled on Jan. 24 to delay enforcing the law for six months for retailers and grocers until the state enacted final regulations for the law. The regulations still apply to pork producers.  The law’s overall goal is to prevent cruel treatment of animals in agriculture. Banning the sale of pork products from companies that don’t follow the regulations is a way to enforce the law.  Hinson is not the only Iowan voicing opposition to the law. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, tweeted on Feb. 25:  ""In Plymouth County, local pork producers & I discussed a number of issues they’re facing, including the need to pass my EATS Act to prohibit states like California from effectively banning #Iowa bacon."" Hinson introduced the Exposing Agricultural Trade Suppression (EATS) Act in August 2021 which would prevent state and local governments from imposing laws that regulate condition standards on the production and manufacturing of agricultural products sold or offered for sale across state lines.  ""California’s radical effort to ban agriculture products grown and raised in states like Iowa is not just an attack on our hardworking farmers and producers, it’s an attack on anyone who likes to eat bacon for breakfast,"" Hinson said when introducing the EATS Act.  Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Randy Feenstra, both Republicans from Iowa, have cosponsored the act.  A similar act was introduced in the Senate that Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ernst have cosponsored.  Hinson and other Republicans from Iowa in Congress are pushing back against California Proposition 12, which bans pork, egg and veal products from companies that don’t follow the law’s confinement area standards.  The product ban, which applies to companies in California but also out of state, is a way to enforce increased space requirements for housing livestock. More exists in the law but pigs raised under the conditions set out in California law may be sold for pork products.  Iowa pork would not be able to be sold in California if the housing conditions for Iowa pigs taken to market do not comply with the law’s rules. Calling what is happening in California a bacon ban is Half True. ",/factchecks/2022/mar/11/ashley-hinson/california-bacon-ban-applies-more-pork-aims-preven/

No evidence that COVID-19 vaccines linked to cancer recurrence
","A viral Facebook video says COVID-19 vaccines are causing cancer recurrence — a claim that is not backed by evidence. ""People who have had cancer in the past, they get the COVID jab and now, they're getting cancer two to three, four months later and it's the same cancer they had except much worse,"" says the speaker in the March 9 video. The video, which has more than 100,000 views, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no data to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines lead to cancer recurrence, said Dr. Steven Pergam, a co-leader of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network committee that developed recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients, in a Q&A with the National Cancer Institute. Because cancer is a common disease, and hundreds of millions of people have been vaccinated against COVID-19, some people will have cancer recurrence around the time of their vaccination, said Dr. Samuel Godfrey, research information team lead at Cancer Research UK, a nonprofit that funds cancer research. It does not mean the vaccine caused the cancer. In the Facebook video, the speaker claims that among people who are having cancer recurrences, ""the cancers we’re seeing are highly resistant to treatment."" But Godfrey said it’s important to understand why cancer recurs — and why, when it does, it is often harder to treat. ""Cancer cells evolve very quickly,"" Godfrey said. ""If someone has a cancer treatment, it only takes one cancer cell in a tumor to find a way to survive that therapy. That surviving cell is too small to detect, but will eventually seed a new tumor that is now resistant to the original treatment."" Fact-checkers have debunked many claims that attempt to link COVID-19 vaccines to cancer, including falsehoods that overall cancer cases have spiked; that soft-tissue cancers have increased; and that the U.S. military has seen exponential increases in cancer diagnoses among its members. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work by instructing cells to make versions of a harmless spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus, so the immune system can recognize the protein and mount an antibody response against the virus in the event of a future infection. Those instructions do not interact with your DNA or alter genes and therefore cannot cause cancer. A number of health officials have noted that one temporary side effect of vaccines is that they can cause lymph nodes to swell in the armpit or other areas near the injection site in a way that mimics an early sign of cancer. While this can be confusing, practitioners say that people receiving cancer screenings soon after vaccination should alert their health care provider about their recent vaccination. A Facebook video says, ""People who have had cancer in the past, they get the COVID jab and now, they're getting cancer two to three, four months later and it's the same cancer they had except much worse."" There is no data to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines lead to cancer recurrence. Cancer is a common disease and hundreds of millions of people have been vaccinated against COVID-19, so it is expected that some people would have cancer recurrence around the time of their vaccination. It is not proof that vaccinations are the cause of the recurrence. We rate this claim False.

New York a leader in vaccines for young people among large states
","Gov. Kathy Hochul cited rates of vaccination against Covid-19 to support her decision to drop the mask mandate in schools.  She announced at a news conference on Feb. 27 that the state would lift the statewide mask mandate for children in school. ""We are No. 1 among all large states in having fully vaccinated teenagers. We are No. 2 in all large states for having fully vaccinated 5- to 11-year olds. We're just a little bit behind Illinois, so I think we can surpass this. We'd like to be No. 1 in everything we do.""  We checked to see if her claims about the vaccination rates among children in New York State, relative to other large states, are accurate.   We reached out to Hochul’s office, and spokesperson Bryan Lesswing said the governor’s office considered the 10 most populated states in its analysis: California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan.  Hochul’s administration looked at the number of vaccines administered by the states for each age group, using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, and the total population in each age group to reach its conclusion. A slide deck from her presentation on the day she announced the end of the mask mandate provided a chart showing large states and rates of full vaccination among young people.    We consulted data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which issues Covid-19 reports for each state. A report from Feb. 25 showed that 33.5% of children ages 5 to 11 and 71.2% of children ages 12 to 17 were fully vaccinated in New York State. Among large states, Illinois had a greater share of children ages 5 to 11 who were fully vaccinated, at 34.8%. Among children ages 12 to 17 in large states, New York had the largest share.  An analysis of vaccination rates from the American Academy of Pediatrics, published on Feb. 23, showed the same results as Hochul presented. In the 10 largest states, New York has the second-highest rate of vaccination in children ages 5 to 11, after Illinois, when children who have had at least one dose of the vaccine are counted. Forty-one percent of children in this age group have had at least one dose in New York. The figure is 42% in Illinois.  Among large states, New York has the highest percentage of children ages 12 to 17 who have received at least one dose, according to the pediatricians’ group. Eighty-two percent of students in this group have received at least one dose, edging out California, which has 81%.  Hochul correctly characterized New York’s vaccination rates among large states in three Covid briefings during February. But she did not do so twice in local news interviews.   In two television interviews on Feb. 28, Hochul did not include ""among large states"" as a qualifier. Across the country, there are 10 states and the District of Columbia with higher rates of vaccination among children ages five to 11 who have had at least one dose, according to the analysis of CDC data from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The 10 states are: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, Virginia, Minnesota, Hawaii, and Illinois.  For children ages 12 to 17, a larger proportion  had at least one dose in six states and the District of Columbia. The states are: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, according to the same analysis.  Hochul said New York State ranked No. 1 one among large states in having fully vaccinated teenagers and No. 2 among large states for having fully vaccinated 5 to 11 year olds.  Data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services confirms Hochul’s statement.  Hochul qualified her claim by saying ""large states"" in a news conference she held to announce the lifting of mask mandates in schools. This qualification is important, as New York does not lead the country in vaccinations among children and teenagers when all 50 states are considered.  We rate this claim True. ",/factchecks/2022/mar/11/kathy-hochul/new-york-leader-vaccines-young-people-among-large-/

Pence falsely blames Biden’s nixing of Keystone pipeline for US reliance on Russian oil
","With its first advertising campaign, a group led by former Vice President Mike Pence said it is spending $10 million on a claim that President Joe Biden, by canceling the Keystone XL oil pipeline, ""dramatically increased Americans' dependence on Russian oil.""  The TV ad from Advancing American Freedom, which Pence founded in April 2021, targeted 16 House Democrats. The ad appeared March 7, the day before Biden announced the United States’ ban on imports of oil and other energy from Russia. The spot opens with violent images of the carnage in Ukraine. Then the narrator says that before Russia’s invasion, ""a horrific decision had already been made. Joe Biden caved to the radical environmentalists and stopped America’s Keystone pipeline, and dramatically increased Americans' dependence on Russian oil, endangering America's security and helping Russia fund their invasion.""    The version of the ad the group posted on YouTube targets Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa. But Advancing American Freedom said the same ad would also target Democrats running for re-election in Arizona, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia in the House, where Democrats have an 11-seat advantage. Pence’s name or image do not appear in the ad. The ad is wrong about Keystone and dependence on Russian oil. Biden on his first day in office canceled the permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported crude oil from Canada to Nebraska, where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.  The pipeline would have been able to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil every day, more than the U.S. imports from Russia, but it would not have been a simple offset. The pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, so it couldn’t have solved today’s demand needs. There would have been no certainty that the pipeline could have produced a net increase of that number of barrels a day, rather than just transporting oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way, and producers would not have been obligated to sell that entire amount to the U.S. In saying the cancellation dramatically increased dependence on Russian oil, the ad quotes ""S&P Global Report"" as saying ""US reliance on Russian oil hits record high."" Advancing American Freedom did not reply to our requests for more information to support the ad’s claim.  We found an April 16, 2021 article from S&P Global, a financial information firm, with this headline: ""Analysis: US reliance on Russian oil hits record high despite souring ties."" The first subheadline read: ""Russia has filled the gap left by US oil sanctions on Venezuela."" The article did not mention the Keystone pipeline. Indeed, we found that Venezuela is the key reason the U.S. increased its Russian oil imports. Russia became a more significant source of oil for the U.S. after the U.S. placed economic sanctions on Venezuela in 2019. In the absence of oil from Venezuela, U.S. oil companies turned to Russia for supplies. That being said, Russia is a relatively small source of oil for the U.S. In 2021, the U.S. imported about 672,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia. That accounted for about 8% of imports overall, and between about 3% and 4% of U.S. oil consumption.  In 2022, preliminary reports indicate that the U.S. has decreased its Russian imports. Experts told PolitiFact that the U.S. could replace Russian imports with American oil, but that it would take time and cost more.  Advancing American Freedom said Biden's cancellation of the Keystone pipeline ""dramatically increased Americans' dependence on Russian oil."" The Keystone pipeline was never built, so Biden’s canceling it didn’t make the U.S. more reliant on Russian oil. The United States’ decision to buy less oil from Venezuela is the key reason the U.S. bought more Russian oil. In 2021, about 3% to 4% of U.S. oil consumption was from Russian imports, but in 2022, preliminary reports indicate that the U.S. has decreased its Russian imports. We rate the statement False.

Despite ‘Made in America’ goals, U.S. tax dollars would go overseas to high carbon emitters
","The ""America First"" doctrine was a central part of Republican President Donald Trump’s administration, with some lawmakers rallying around Trump’s approach to international relations, including skepticism of international organizations and trade deals.  Now, with Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, argues the opposite is happening when it comes to efforts to address climate change..  In a Feb. 3, 2022 tweet, Grothman said: ""The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not. Meanwhile, @POTUS is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same standards we do at home."" We previously checked the first part of the claim, on the U.S. making progress even as some other countries have not, and rated it True. For this fact check, we are focused on the second part of the claim: Biden trying to send taxpayer dollars overseas to high-pollution countries. Is Grothman right? In this case, China – the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases – plays a key role, particularly as it relates to some of the products being boosted by Bidens plan. When asked for backup, Grothman’s staff cited an Oct. 22, 2021 Solar Reviews article that stated two-thirds of all solar panels are made in China, and an April 17, 2021 CNBC report that said China also dominates the rare mineral market. (According to the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2019, China was responsible for 80% of rare earths imports.)  This is what the CNBC report had to say about their importance and use: ""Once extracted from mines, rare earths are shipped to separation facilities, where they are separated from other minerals. Then rare earths are individually separated into oxides, metals and finally magnets that are used in everything from missiles to wind turbines, medical devices, power tools, cellphones and motors for hybrid and electric vehicles."" Grothman’s team connected that dominance by China with Biden’s stalled Build Back Better plan, which includes increases in energy tax credits for solar, wind, geothermal, waste, fuel cell, and energy storage technologies.  The implication is that subsidies for the purchase of solar panels, and other items that include rare earth minerals, means that tax dollars would be on the way to Chinese manufacturers. This is where Grothman’s claim runs into problems.  First, in its phrasing – ""trying to send"" – the claim suggests a primary objective of the Biden plan is to send the money overseas.  That ignores the fact the Build Back Better plan includes a ""Made in America"" provision to make products manufactured here a priority, as well as a plan to help make the U.S. a player in the rare earths supply chain. Indeed, ""Made in America"" has been a hallmark of Biden’s presidency. For instance, in his March 1, 2022, State of the Union address, Biden declared: ""There’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America.""  That’s all great in theory. But how does it work in practice? Abdur Chowdhury, professor emeritus in economics at Marquette University, noted that ""in global geopolitics, you cannot always achieve what you want.""  ""As China controls the global supply of rare earth minerals, it is true that some U.S. taxpayer dollars would go to high polluting nations like China, India,"" Chowdhury said. ""So the U.S. has to participate in various global climate change negotiations in order to force these countries to reduce environmental pollution."" He added: ""Withdrawing from the international discussion and negotiation on a number of environmental issues is not the answer. The U.S. can and should use its leverage to force countries to reduce environmental pollution.""  For our purposes, we’re left with a claim that overstates the intent and effect of Biden’s proposal, particularly in the way a reader would likely understand it.  The taxpayer money would not go directly to China. But based on the use of rare earths, China would derive a secondary benefit from increased spending on wind turbines and other products bolstered by Biden’s plan. Grothman claimed Biden ""is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same (carbon emission) standards we do at home."" That is certainly not the intent of the Build Back Better plan, which includes ""Made in America"" provisions and efforts to guard against this happening. But economists note that China’s dominance in rare earths, for instance, means they would benefit from the spending as well. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.

U.S. is making progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions when compared to the rest of the world
","In 2018, 15-year-old Greta Thunberg sparked a worldwide movement to meet carbon emissions targets when she protested outside the Swedish parliament holding a sign saying ""School Strike for Climate."" That protest inspired students across the globe to hold similar demonstrations demanding action from their governments on climate change. The issue remains at the forefront, though measures to address climate change are stalled in Congress. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, took to the floor of Congress to stake out a view that he says is rarely heard – that the United States is already doing a better job than the rest of the world at addressing the issue.  In a Feb. 3, 2022 tweet that included a snippet of the floor speech, Grothman made this claim: ""The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not. Meanwhile, @POTUS is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same standards we do at home."" In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Grothman expanded on the comment. ""I feel that many young people are being misled into thinking our country is polluting more than it ever has,"" Grothman said. ""In reality, air and water pollution have decreased significantly in the last 40 years. I also feel that given the growth of the Chinese and Indian economies, people in the U.S. have to be conscious that changes in our laws can inadvertently push jobs to these other countries who do not have the same environmental standards we do."" Both parts of Grothman’s claim caught our attention. We took a look at the overseas manufacturers claim and rated it Half True.   But what about the claim on carbon emissions and progress.  The claim is that the U.S. is ahead of ""other parts of the world"" in terms of the strides it has made. Admittedly, the ""other parts of the world"" is a bit vague, but we interpret it to mean the US is doing better than many other countries that – like it – are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. When asked for backup, Grothman staffers pointed to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report titled ""Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2020.""  The report said that CO2 – carbon monoxide – emissions from fossil fuel combustion fell by 8.4% in that 30-year period. Looking at just the 15-year period of 2005 to 2020, they fell 24.7%. (In the final year covered, from 2019 to 2020, the figure was 10.7%) So, U.S. emissions have fallen, but Grothman stated that as a comparison to other parts of the world, so we need to look broader. Researchers with the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm focused on global trends, have tracked that data back decades. Their data puts China as the world’s top emitter, followed by the United States. The data groups the European Union as one, in addition to listing its individual nations such as Germany. According to the data provided, here are the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters for the years 2010 and 2019, with total net emissions in million metric tons of CO2e (bundles of greenhouse gases):                                               2010           2019           Percent change China                         11,235        14,093          +25.4% U.S.                              6,241         5,724           -8.2% India                             2,504          3,422           +36.6% European Union           3,868         3,334           -13.8% Brazil                            2,124         1,458          -31.3% Indonesia                      1,113          1,765         +58.5% Russia                           1,335           1,619          +21.2% Japan                             1,232           1,142          -7.3% Germany                           923               771         -16.4% Canada                             665               707         +6.3%  So when compared to the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters, the United States has made progress, decreasing emissions 8.2% from 2010 to 2019. China and India saw the biggest increases among those countries, 25.4% and 36.6%.  Of note: Brazil made the most progress for that time period among the top 5 emitters, with a decrease of 31.3%. However, by 2020-2021, as The New York Times reported Nov. 2, 2021, Brazil’s progress has stalled and the country is now seeing increasing emission levels, largely driven by a surge in deforestation.  Grothman said ""The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not.""  When compared to the world’s other top greenhouse gas emitters, the United States has made progress – its emissions falling 8.2% from 2010 to 2019. While the US is not tops in terms of decreases, Grothman’s claim was a relative one. And China and India are among countries that have seen increases, not decreases.

Yes, oil companies are reporting record breaking profits. But it follows pandemic-fueled losses
","Gas prices in the United States have been on the rise since Russia invaded Ukraine, but a Facebook post says these high prices come as major oil companies experience record profits.    The Facebook post was shared on March 7 and is an image of a tweet made by Dan Price, the CEO of a Seattle-based credit card processing company that made headlines in 2015 when it raised minimum salaries for employees to $70,000. ""Gas prices are rising at their fastest pace ever, and have topped $4 for the first time since 2008,"" Price’s March 6 tweet said. ""America gets 1% of its oil from Russia, while Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell profits are at their highest level in over 7 years."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is right that the U.S. is not heavily dependent on Russia for its oil, but its numbers are slightly understated. And while it was correct in its assertion that oil companies have recorded record profits, it ignored that those gains followed pandemic-era losses.  Gas prices had steadily been on the rise since before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Much of that has been due to slow economic recovery following profoundly disruptive pandemic-era supply and demand changes. But gas prices quickly shot up when war broke out between the countries on Feb. 24. Global crude oil prices jumped to more than $100 a barrel, hitting their highest levels since 2008. The American Automobile Association announced March 7, a day after Price’s tweet, that the higher oil prices caused the average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. to reach $4.06 — a price jump of 45 cents compared to the previous week and 62 cents from the previous month. The next day, it went to $4.17 per gallon. Not accounting for inflation, it’s the highest the national average gas price since July 2008, AAA reported. Economic sanctions against Russia by the U.S., European Union and Japan have disrupted Russia’s financial system including its oil industry, as several international oil companies announced their intention to divest their stakes in Russian energy. And President Joe Biden on March 8 announced a ban on Russian oil imports, which he said is expected to push gas prices up further. The U.S. receives imported oil from more than 80 countries and saw 5.88 million barrels of crude oil per day flow into the country for 2020, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Though Russia is among the top five sources of imported oil for the U.S., data from the EIA shows the bulk of imported oil comes from Canada, and only a small fraction is from Russia. The U.S. imported around 672,000 barrels of petroleum products, including crude oil, a day from Russia in 2021, the EIA reported. That accounted for around 8% of overall oil imports received by the U.S., with about 3% being crude oil — not the 1% as stated in the social media post. Oil companies did announce record breaking profits earlier this year. Exxon Mobil made $23 billion in profit for 2021. But that came after suffering $22.4 billion in losses the previous year because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn. The New York Times reported the company's profit was the highest it had been since 2014. Chevron also experienced its most profitable year since 2014, with the company reporting in January that it made $15.6 billion in revenue for 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal. That followed a loss of $5.5 billion in 2020. BP reported it made $12.85 billion in 2021, with $4.1 billion being made in the fourth financial quarter. Reuters reported the quarterly profit was the largest the company has had since 2013. That followed a $5.7 billion loss in 2020, its first in a decade. Reuters also reported that Shell made significant profits in 2021, earning $19.29 billion for the year, up from $4.85 billion in 2020. In the final financial quarter of 2021, the company earned $6.4 billion, Shell’s highest quarterly profit since 2014.

It’s true that U.S. dependence on Russian oil imports has been small. About 8% of all petroleum products imported into the U.S. have come from Russia — and 3%, not 1%, are crude oil.

China repeats false claim that U.S has biolabs in Ukraine
","China’s government is amplifying debunked claims about non-existent U.S. biological weapons labs in Ukraine, bringing the falsehoods back into the spotlight on social media. A March 9 post on Instagram describes remarks from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who said on March 9 that the U.S. has such biolabs in Ukraine.   The post is a screenshot of Zhao at a podium with text that says, ""China urges Pentagon to disclose alleged ‘biolabs’ in Ukraine ‘as soon as possible.’"" The text also says, ""Beijing believes the laboratories in Ukraine are just the ‘tip of an iceberg,’"" and the U.S. controls 336 biological laboratories in 30 countries around the world.  A caption on the post reads, ""Russia found over 30 biological labs (with evidence of bioweapons) in Ukraine formed by the Pentagon in areas bordering Russia. If true, this is more than a bit concerning.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Following Zhao’s remarks, U.S. government officials said unequivocally that the U.S. does not have biolabs in Ukraine. The claims distort U.S. government support of Ukraine’s public health laboratories that research infectious diseases. Zhao’s remarks were posted March 9 in a video on Twitter. According to the English translation, he said, ""Presently the U.S. biological labs in Ukraine have indeed attracted much attention. According to reports, in these facilities a large quantity of dangerous viruses are stored. Russia has found during its military operations that the U.S. uses these facilities to conduct military plans. According to data released by the U.S., it has 26 labs in Ukraine.""  But the U.S. is ""not developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine. It's not happening,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said during a March 9 press briefing.  And White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter on March 9 that Chinese officials were echoing conspiracy theories from Russia. ""The United States is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere,"" Psaki wrote.  Andy Weber, former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical, and biological defense programs, is now a board member of the Arms Control Association Board, a nonprofit that advocates for effective arms control policies on a global scale. Weber said the U.S. Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has provided technical support to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health since 2005 to improve its public health laboratories, whose mission is analogous to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Work by these labs has been instrumental in stemming the spread of COVID-19. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program began after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 to reduce the threat of existing weapons of mass destruction. It is also known as the Nunn-Lugar Program (named after the senators who passed the Soviet Threat Reduction Act) and is housed within the Defense Department’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-proliferation. In the wake of disinformation about these labs, the Department of Defense released a video attempting to explain their work. All the labs in the program are ""owned, operated and manned by host governments to meet local needs,"" it said.  Psaki warned March 9 that the claims by Russia and China appear to be falsely laying the groundwork to justify further violence: ""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern.""  A spokesperson for the Chinese government said the U.S. has biolabs in Ukraine.   The claim originated with the Russian government and has been previously debunked by U.S. government officials and weapons control advocates. Following Zhao’s March 9 remarks, U.S. government officials strongly refuted the claims again, saying the false narrative was being used to lay the groundwork for further violence in Ukraine. ",/factchecks/2022/mar/10/instagram-posts/china-repeats-false-claim-us-has-biolabs-ukraine/

Social media post on drilling and cost of Russian oil misses the mark on why prices are so high
","As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to upend the energy market and drive up oil prices, some have used the crisis as an opportunity to point fingers at the Biden administration, alleging that policy decisions on domestic drilling are solely to blame for the higher price tags. Take this March 6 Facebook post, for example: ""2 years ago we were drilling our own oil for $27 a barrel…We’re now paying $105 a barrel to Russia."" There are multiple problems with this claim. It represents a misunderstanding of how the global market operates, and the pressure it’s under today. The current price of a barrel of oil has a lot less to do with the U.S. drilling than the post suggests and a lot more to do with the impact of a global pandemic and a war between Russia and Ukraine. The numbers presented in the post are misleading, energy experts told us.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While it’s true that prices have gone up, the U.S. was selling its oil around $27, and losing money in the process — not drilling at that price.  ""Saying that we could drill at $27 a barrel is preposterous, it’s not even close,"" Clark Williams-Derry, an energy analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told PolitiFact. ""And the reason that oil prices were low — there's the thing called COVID-19. The global pandemic cratered global demand for oil and it was a financial bloodbath for the energy industry.""  The Facebook post gives the impression that buying oil from Russia is a new thing. But it’s not. The U.S. has purchased oil from Russia for decades. Energy analysts said that the $105 per barrel from Russia cited in the post probably isn’t too far off, though it’s hard to pinpoint. Prices in general were going up throughout January and February, though, so the U.S. was paying more for all oil imports, not just those from Russia. Russian crude oil accounted for about 3% of overall U.S. crude oil imports in 2021. Oil prices are set on a global market. Any supply disruption, anywhere, affects prices in the U.S. When the pandemic hit, global demand for gasoline dropped and cratered the price of oil. Since that initial economic wallop, demand has risen steadily as business activity has increased. Yet supply hasn’t been able to recover as quickly, due to delays in restoring drilling capacity, higher transportation costs, a tight labor market and sluggish production increases. As a result, prices of crude oil have risen consistently in recent months.  The war in Ukraine, meanwhile, has added more global volatility and impacted the supply of oil from Russia, the second largest producer of crude. American oil companies also watch the market closely to determine whether it's worthwhile to extract more oil, what they call ""putting money in the ground."" And right now, they aren’t doing that. For one, companies have to build new rigs, drill new wells, install new gear and may not see any oil or profit for several months. Add in a volatile market, and they tend to resist making big investments. While moves to expand renewable energy sources by the Biden administration have also made some companies less eager to invest, energy experts say many firms are currently focused more on their investors than on boosting supplies.  ""There is no evidence that Biden has increased oil prices. Instead, what is clear is that the oil industry is making a lot of money and choosing not to invest that money in new production. They don't want to,"" Williams-Derry said. ""And the Biden administration doesn't have many easy legal tools at its disposal to nationalize the oil industry and force companies to produce more."" While the Facebook post accurately shows how expensive oil is right now, it ignores several factors that are impacting the energy industry, analysts said, and can’t be attributed to President Joe Biden, or any one domestic policy. Global turmoil and uncertainty impact prices, Williams-Derry said, ""and that has everything to do with COVID-19 and war and nothing to do with the actions of any one politician, other than, right now, Vladimir Putin.""  ""Even if we produced two times what we consumed, if there is a war that raises oil prices in the E.U., the price in the U.S. will rise,"" Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management, wrote on Twitter.  Increasing domestic production can lower prices to an extent, experts say, but it’s incredibly hard to be ""oil independent."" Why? Because when the price of oil increases somewhere in the world, it increases here. Ramping up domestic production can lower the global price, but minimally, because that production increase gets spread around the world. Some Republicans and conservative commentators have claimed that Biden halted leasing for oil and gas and is holding back production.  While Biden ordered a temporary pause on new federal leases in the first few months of his administration pending a review of federal permitting and leasing practices, a Louisiana federal judge ruled against it in June. Oil production remained unphased in the U.S., even when the order was in effect. The U.S. Energy Information Administration also reported earlier this year that domestic crude oil production is expected to top 12.4 million barrels per day by 2023, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Biden hasn’t stopped any production that occurs on private lands, nor has he shut down existing leases on federal lands. The Biden administration issued more drilling permits on public lands and water in its first year than did the Trump administration in its first year, according to federal data analyzed by the Center for Biological Diversity. A Facebook post claims that, two years ago, the U.S. was drilling its own oil for $27 a barrel and thanks to Biden is now paying Russia $105 a barrel. The U.S. was not drilling it’s own oil for $27 — it was selling at these types of low prices at a loss due to effects from the pandemic. The U.S. has purchased oil from Russia for decades and the $105 per barrel from Russia cited in the post is probable, but prices in general were going up and the U.S. was paying more for all oil imports, not just those from Russia. Biden and his policies are not playing a meaningful role in the rising prices, experts said. The surge is due to multiple things, including rising demand amid sluggish production increases from pandemic lows, as well as the war in Ukraine.  We rate this post False.  RELATED: Ask PolitiFact: Why are gas prices going up?  RELATED: Fact-checking Biden’s claim that there are 9,000 unused oil drilling permits",/factchecks/2022/mar/10/facebook-posts/social-media-post-drilling-and-cost-russian-oil-mi/

No, this video on Facebook doesn't show someone 'counting Biden’s votes at 2 a.m.'
","A Facebook post that features a video viewed millions of times appears to suggest that someone is rapid fire counting ballots cast for President Joe Biden. The seven-second video shows a person’s hand gripping a machine as it zips its way down a massive stack of paper.  The caption under the video states: ""Counting Biden's votes at 2am 😂 I’m not much of a conspiracy theorist but I have to admit this was funny."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video was posted by Steve West, founder of Steve’s Outdoor Adventures in Oregon. West told us that someone sent the video to him and that he posted it as a joke. West told us that he thought the equipment in the video was a belt sander. ""It’s just satire — don’t take it seriously,"" West said. ""I took it for what it was: a funny joke, a cool video. It’s for entertainment’s sake. I didn’t realize it inflamed some people and made them angry."" Some commenters did see it as a joke, but plenty of others saw it as a sign of election wrongdoing. The phrase ""counting Biden’s votes at 2 a.m."" feeds into the falsehoods that election workers in 2020 ""found"" votes for Biden or in Democratic strongholds such as Detroit in the middle of the night.  The fact that election workers process and count ballots late at night is not a sign of fraud. It is routine ballot tabulation. The process took longer in some jurisdictions in 2020 due to the surge in voting by mail. It also takes time for election workers to verify and process mail ballots before they are tabulated. So what is happening in the video? The video appears to show a machine removing stubs off of sheets of paper. Based on the color and size, they are not ballots; election officials and experts told us they knew of no election office that used such a machine for ballots. ""I've never seen any power tool like that used in any stage of ballot processing,"" said Douglas W. Jones, an expert on voting systems and a retired computer science professor at the University of Iowa. ""If I were in the ballot processing business, I wouldn't let anyone go near ballots with a machine like that!"" Election officials in Alabama and Michigan, two states that use ballots with perforated stubs, said they don’t use such a machine for stub removal.  In Michigan, Lansing City Clerk Chris Swope said that election workers remove the perforated stub on the ballot by hand before the ballot is fed into a tabulator.  The paper in the video appears yellow, but in Michigan the ballots are white, Swope said. And absentee ballots, which are folded, are not as flat as the paper in the video. Another election expert noted the red stripe on parts of the paper, which isn’t a typical part of ballots. Jones said the strips being torn off appear to be about 8 inches long, ""consistent with the bottom edge of a ballot but equally consistent with the bottom edge of just about any billing form."" An election equipment vendor, Election Systems and Software, told us that the machine in the video is not something they use, and to their knowledge it has nothing to do with ballots. But it appears to be a paper stripper used to get rid of excess paper in a stack. Here is an example of a waste paper/carton stripper on YouTube.  We found the same video as the one West posted in a few YouTube videos shared in February. Based on the titles that called it the ""amazing magic machine"" and ""#satisfying,"" it appears users just found the machine mesmerizing.  We don’t know the details about the type of paper in this video, but we know that it doesn’t show counting ballots for Biden at 2 a.m. We rate this statement False.

Medicare and football? Democratic congressional candidate Shelley Adler falls short with mock broadcast targeting Rep. Jon Runyan
","
A former offensive tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles, U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan has apparently found new opponents to tackle on a front lawn or block from a pharmacy counter: senior citizens on Medicare.

That’s at least the message in a new TV ad from his Democratic challenger, Shelley Adler, who is looking to unseat the Republican congressman in the Nov. 6 general election.

The ad, released Sept. 12 on YouTube, features a mock sports broadcast about Runyan’s support for a Medicare reform proposal from Wisconsin congressman and Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan.

Two broadcasters deliver a play-by-play account as a man wearing a suit and a football helmet tackles an elderly man mowing his lawn, and then holds back two senior citizens struggling to grab medicine from a pharmacist.

One broadcaster says, ""No one likes his plan to raise Medicare costs $6,400 a year,"" and the other broadcaster adds, ""But Runyan won’t budge.""

But Adler deserves a penalty flag of her own. That $6,400 estimate applies to Ryan’s old Medicare plan -- not the current one -- and the TV ad wrongly suggests those higher costs would impact current Medicare beneficiaries.

Adler spokesman Michael Muller argued the ""ad speaks to the long term future of the program,"" and defended using the $6,400 figure.

""This is what he voted for. Voters have a right to know that,"" Muller told us. ""His record is what it is.""

The outdated figure cited in the TV ad is based on an April 2011 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. The think tank used data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to analyze the Medicare plan put forward by Ryan in early 2011.

Under that plan, future beneficiaries, starting in 2022, would not be allowed to enroll in the current Medicare program. Instead, they would receive ""premium support"" payments to put toward private insurance premiums.

The think tank report estimated that a beneficiary in 2022 would pay $6,350 more in out-of-pocket costs for private coverage than under traditional Medicare.

But here’s the problem: Ryan has since revised his plan, making changes to how those payments would be calculated and how they could be spent.

Under Ryan’s latest plan, future beneficiaries, starting in 2023, could use the payments for private plans as well as a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Also, the payments would be based on the second least-expensive plan available, and slightly more generous in how fast they would increase.

So, the payments should be enough to cover the two cheapest plans offered.

As for Runyan, he has voted in favor of both versions of Ryan’s Medicare plan.

But the budget office has not analyzed how this latest proposal would specifically affect beneficiary costs. In a March 2012 report, the budget office said ""beneficiaries might face higher costs,"" but added the ""CBO does not have the capability at this time to estimate such effects for the specified path of Medicare spending.""

Still, it’s misleading for Adler to cite a figure based on an old version of Ryan’s proposal.

Another problem with Adler’s TV ad is it fails to mention how that $6,400 estimate only applies to future beneficiaries. 
Current beneficiaries would be able to remain in the current Medicare program and face no premium support payments. But viewers are left to infer the payments and the $6,400 figure would affect people already on Medicare. 
Calling the ad ""dishonest,"" Runyan spokesman Chris Russell said in an e-mail that the congressman ""voted to protect Medicare for current seniors and preserve it for future generations.""

Our ruling

Adler’s TV ad claimed Runyan has a ""plan to raise Medicare costs $6,400 a year,"" suggesting the higher costs would impact current beneficiaries.

But that figure is based on an old version of the Medicare reform plan, and does not account for changes made in the latest proposal. Also, that estimate does not apply to current beneficiaries, who could remain in the existing program.

Since Runyan voted for the old plan, we give Adler’s statement a Mostly False.

Did 29 states dump the estate tax to be more competitive?
","
The estate tax is the tax the government levies on your right to transfer assets upon death. Fans of the tax have called it the ""Paris Hilton tax,"" after the hotel heiress who would benefit from a permanent repeal. Critics, who prefer to call it the ""death tax,"" collected enough signatures to put a ballot measure on the Nov. 6, 2012, ballot to phase out the tax by 2016.

The ""Yes on 84"" campaign website has a page dedicated to ""7 Reasons to Eliminate"" the tax. Reason No. 6 is that the estate tax ""weakens us — Oregon is one of only three states west of the Mississippi with a death tax."" Estate tax haters say the tax discourages investment in Oregon because there are 29 other states where they can go to accumulate wealth and die, free from worry that the state will hit their heirs with a bill.

Here’s how the argument ends: ""In 2001, all 50 states had some form of a death tax. The reason 29 states no longer have such a tax is that the tax damaged their economic competitiveness.""

We knew from a previous PolitiFact Oregon check that Oregon is in the minority with its estate or inheritance tax, but we were a little fuzzy on how that all happened. Did 29 states dump their tax because of fear that another state would woo away rich residents? Like Paris Hilton’s dad?

We have to back up for a minute and explain how this works, because most of us will not die with enough money to have to pay this tax. In Oregon, the first $1 million of a person’s estate is exempt and the amounts above that are taxed at graduated rates. The federal government is more generous. The IRS exempts the first $5 million and has a maximum tax rate of 35 percent. That could change. Read on.

The feds didn’t always have a $5 million threshold. It used to be $675,000 but in 2001, President Bush signed the first of what’s come to be known as the Bush-era tax cuts. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 -- better known to wonks as EGTRRA -- gradually increased the allowed exemption and lowered the maximum tax rate until 2010, when the estate tax would be repealed. In 2010, Congress set the current exemption and tax rate through 2012, at which point members need to review the issue again.

How did the 2001 law affect states? Or, more importantly, what was the competition like for those very wealthy, dying individuals?

The short version is that all 50 states were connected to the federal estate tax in some way, so they were pretty much on even footing. Most states used the ""pickup"" or ""sponge"" tax to get a share of the tax paid without imposing a separate tax on the deceased resident. This is why it’s accurate to say that all 50 states had an estate tax in 2001. The 2001 law gradually eliminated the credit that states could claim until it zeroed out in 2005.

Elizabeth McNichol of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, says that following the 2001 law, a dozen states decoupled from the federal estate tax law, allowing those states to continue collecting those taxes. Three states, including Oregon and Washington, approved estate taxes not tied to the federal tax. Seven states had to do nothing to maintain their estate or inheritance tax. The other states let their ""death tax"" provisions die.

""So with the Bush tax cuts in 2001, states were put to a choice of whether they would implement their own estate tax or whether they would let it phase out,"" said J.L. Wilson, a lobbyist with Associated Oregon Industries whose group supports the state ballot measure. ""Most of the states in the west allowed their estate taxes to phase out.""

We contacted Kevin Mannix, the Salem attorney and former legislator who is president of Common Sense for Oregon, the main organization leading the campaign in support of the measure.

First, he pointed out that the Measure 84 website has several tabs, including the ""reasons to eliminate"" page, which he considers to be arguments. The ""death tax facts"" page, Mannix says, is where the campaign puts out ""facts,"" as opposed to ""arguments."" (A very interesting argument, we say.)

On we go to the facts page, where point No. 2 reads: ""In 2001, all 50 states had estate/inheritance taxes. Since then 31 states have repealed them."" That’s not true, since not all of the states actually repealed estate tax legislation, but Mannix says the campaign was ""trying to shorthand the statement.""  

So let’s return to the ""reasons"" page, which Mannix has by now changed, in light of PolitiFact Oregon’s query: ""In 2001, all 50 states had some form of a death tax. Since then, 31 states have done away with such a tax."" Mannix acknowledged that the campaign lacked the evidence to make the assertion that concerns over economic competitiveness had prompted the mass departure after 2001.

""Our main point is that in terms of competitiveness,"" he says, ""every time another state eliminates the tax, those in the diminishing number that still have the tax are in a more difficult position.""

Sure, that makes intuitive sense. If PolitiFact Oregon had $5 million and we could choose where we die, we might opt for the state without an estate tax so we could leave more money to the baby PolitiFact-lets. But we suspect there are many reasons that factor into where a person dies, even many financial reasons.

As of now, 28 states do not have an estate tax. That will grow to 29 in January when Ohio’s repeal goes into effectand to 30 in July when Delaware’s estate tax is set to expire. Earlier this year, Tennessee lawmakers agreed to phase out the state’s inheritance tax by 2016. The rest of the states have an estate tax, inheritance tax, or both in the case of New Jersey and Maryland.

On the West Coast, Hawaii let its tax lapse but approved a new one. Washington lawmakers approved an estate tax right away in 2005, which voters declined to repeal in 2006. Oregon lawmakers voted in 2003 to reconnect to the 1997 federal tax code, and not the 2001 one.

""We did make a conscious decision to connect,"" says Mazen Malik, senior economist with the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office.

(By the way, he also said his office found that repealing the death tax could result in a tiny bump of wealthier people moving to Oregon or deciding to stay in Oregon, but that any added tax benefit was negligible compared with an estimated $100 million a year Oregon collects in estate taxes.)

A key argument of the Yes on 84 campaign is to claim that Oregon is at an economic disadvantage because of our estate tax. Saying that more than half of states got rid of their estate tax laws because they feared being at an economic disadvantage drives home the point that Oregon could be dumb for not doing the same.

But that wasn’t the stated reason for most of those states. They didn’t take a vote to repeal. The feds made the change. The states just let the provisions lapse.

Mannix admitted he lacked the documentation to say that states no longer have an estate tax because of competitive fears. We’ll reiterate here what we’ve said elsewhere: Campaigns have a special responsibility to make sure they put out accurate statements. One would think that Mannix, a former legislator with decades of experience in Oregon public policy, would understand that.

Mannix corrected the statement in the ""arguments"" section online, although he still has an inaccurate statement on the ""facts"" page. We’re not going to elaborate on what we think about differentiating between arguments and facts, except to say that no matter what the label is, statements of fact should be accurate. This one isn’t.

We rule the statement False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/14/yes-84/did-29-states-dump-estate-tax-be-more-competitive/

Bill Hammond says that if trends hold, one in three Texas workers will lack high school diploma by 2040
","
In an opinion piece published in Texas newspapers in August 2012, the chairman of the Texas Association of Business opened his call for funding successful preschool programs by suggesting potential among the state’s toddlers.

""Our homes and preschools are filled with aspiring astronauts, firefighters, teachers and computer scientists,"" Bill Hammond wrote. ""Unfortunately, if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma. That's not dreaming big, that's a Texas-sized nightmare. It's a formula for broken dreams, dead-end jobs and a strain on the state's economy.""

Are we on track for one of three adult Texans to lack even a high school diploma? 
That would be more than double the nearly 15 percent of the state’s 10.2 million workers aged 25 through 64 who had not graduated from high school as of 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. 
Asked for his backup, Hammond pointed us toward Steven Murdock, the former state demographer who directs the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University.

In a telephone interview, Murdock said Hammond was echoing a projection included in a 2003 book, ""The New Texas Challenge,"" written by several authors led by Murdock.

Murdock told us the projection, to be updated within the next year, was based on changes in the state’s racial and ethnic populations and assuming that people would continue to have the same levels of education in 2040 as 2000.

Broadly, he said, generally highly-educated baby boomers have started retiring from the workforce and will continue to do so for the next 15 years. He said the baby boomers are being replaced with less-educated workers.

""It’s a simple simulation,"" he said. ""What we’re simply saying is that"" the share of workers lacking a high school diploma ""will absolutely be the case if we have the population growth we project and we do not have a change in the educational attainment of our different racial and ethnic groups.""

The relevant section of the book says that ""in the absence of change in the educational characteristics of Blacks and Hispanics -- populations that are projected to grow more rapidly than the Anglo population -- the state’s labor force will be less well educated in the future than in 2000.""

A chart in the book shows that in 2000, nearly 19 percent of the state’s labor force lacked a high school diploma while 30.1 percent of the workforce will fit that category as of 2040. The projection, Murdock writes, is predicated on assuming that migration rates by age, sex and race-ethnicity remain what they were from 1990 to 2000.

According to the chart, some 29 percent of the workforce will consist of high school graduates, about the same as in 2000, and about 24 percent of the workforce will have completed some college, compared to 29 percent in 2000. Finally, about 13 percent of the workforce will have a bachelor’s degree compared to 18 percent in 2000 while about 4 percent will have a graduate or professional degree compared to 5 percent in 2000.

We asked Murdock if anything could knock his 30 percent projection askew.

""A lot of things could,"" he replied, including whether some slowing  in Hispanic immigration and/or a drop in Hispanic birth rates in the state prove permanent. Another factor, he said, would be state decisions to step up, or ratchet down, educational spending.

Next, we asked an outside demographer, Elwood Carlson, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, if the methodology behind the projection seems solid. Carlson said the approach -- a cohort component survival projection model --  is a standard way of reaching such a forecast.

Our ruling

Hammond said ""if current trends continue, by 2040, one out of three Texas workers will not have a high school diploma."" Murdock’s projection is that all factors staying the same, about 30 percent of workers will lack a high school diploma.

Obama campaign says 89 million Americans 'could' be denied health coverage under Mitt Romney
","
The ""Obama Truth Team"" wants you to tell your Facebook friends: Bad things will happen if Mitt Romney repeals the Affordable Care Act.

A recent image posted to the team’s Facebook page pairs photos of President Barack Obama and Romney under the label ""The Choice."" Then it contrasts two numbers. ""Number of Americans who could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition"" under Obama? Zero. Under Romney? 89 million.

Obama’s health care law forbids insurers from using someone’s health or lack of it to ""determine eligibility, benefits or premiums."" Romney, the Republican candidate for president, has promised an effort to repeal the law. But he says that people with pre-existing conditions, as long as they’ve been insured in the past, shouldn’t be denied coverage. 
(He introduced confusion for a day Sept. 9, 2012, when he told NBC’s Meet the Press that, ""I'm not getting rid of all of health care reform. Of course, there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I'm going to put in place. One is to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage."" But his aides quickly clarified he still meant protection just for those who had maintained ""continuous coverage."") 
We wanted to know: Could 89 million people be vulnerable to insurers using pre-existing conditions to deny them health coverage under Romney?

There’s some support for this statistic — alongside significant caveats.

The Romney plan

Romney’s health care plan doesn’t pack a lot of details, and his campaign didn’t answer our requests for clarification.

But he has consistently said that the Affordable Care Act should go away, and that people with health conditions who have ""maintained  continuous health insurance coverage should be guaranteed the ability to retain coverage.""

Democrats argue that means people who suffer gaps in coverage — after, say, a lost job — wouldn’t be protected under Romney. And that’s where the ""89 million"" figure comes from: a recent study of the number of people who lost insurance coverage for at least a month between 2003 and 2007.

The idea is that if some of those 89 million happened to have a pre-existing condition, a gap in their health insurance could mean ""denied coverage"" later. But it’s not that simple.

We checked out a summary of the August 2012 study from the Commonwealth Fund, and chatted with one of its authors and several other health care experts about the accuracy of the campaign claim.

""If you take it very literally, it's accurate,"" said Pamela Short, one of the Commonwealth Fund study authors, who was a health care expert on President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. ""... It doesn't mean it would, but it could.""  

Other experts were less generous.

Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and founding editor of conservative magazine National Review, called the statistic ""absurd and false.""

Here’s how both of them are right.

• The 89 million encompasses those with coverage gaps — not necessarily those with pre-existing conditions. Estimates of how many Americans actually have pre-existing conditions vary widely.

• Even if Obamacare disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. Health experts we talked to assumed Romney would basically firm up the requirements of that law — which applies primarily to people with employer-based coverage, not less common individual policies — and perhaps strengthen it so it also applied to the individual market. But the group in the study is bigger than that, including those with coverage gaps of ""at least one month.""

• That same law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, only allows insurers to look back 18 months for coverage gaps of 63 days or more. But the study tallied those who had gaps over a four-year period.

• The study looked at people ages 4 to 64 with public and private health care coverage. But people who qualify for Medicaid, for example, couldn’t be at risk for being ""denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition.""

• Some people rejected for coverage for pre-existing conditions before the Affordable Care Act qualified for insurance through state-run ""high-risk pools,"" an idea Romney includes in his health care proposals.

So the Obama campaign claim is true only under the most literal reading of Romney’s approach — that ""continuous coverage"" could mean exactly that, with no allowances even for short gaps protected under the law for many people since the 1990s. (And even then, you’d have to subtract people who could take advantage of public insurance and high-risk pools.)

Meanwhile, conservative health experts say that the group of reforms recommended by Romney, which focus on separating health insurance from employment, would cut down on gaps in health coverage.

""The idea is that you create a new system in which it's much easier to get insurance yourself, give people a window (a kind of open season) to get insured in that system if they're not already insured, and then after that protect those who are from then on continuously insured,"" Levin said.

 The ruling

The Obama campaign says that under Romney, 89 million Americans could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition. Democrats point to Romney’s promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act as evidence, along with Romney’s statements that people should be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured.

The ""89 million"" comes from a study that looked at coverage gaps, without a focus on pre-existing conditions. Some of those 89 million — those on public insurance, or whose gaps were less than 63 days or more than 18 months old, or who qualified for high-risk pools — could be protected in a non-Affordable Care Act world. That reduces the number of people who could suffer coverage denials.

So while Romney would work to repeal blanket protection for people with pre-existing conditions, the claim that he could expose ""89 million"" to the possibility of denied coverage is only partially accurate, and leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/14/barack-obama/obama-campaign-says-89-million-americans-could-be/

Romney claims five studies back up his tax plan
","
In the relentless back and forth over which candidate would raise taxes on middle-income Americans, President Barack Obama used a study from the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, as fuel for an ad claiming Mitt Romney would cut taxes on the rich and raise them for middle-income taxpayers.

We examined that ad and ruled it Mostly True. The Tax Policy Center study has become a thorn in the side for the Romney campaign and the former Massachusetts governor is now refuting its findings.

""The good news,"" Romney said on NBC’s Meet the Press, on Sept. 9, 2012, "" is that five different economic studies -- including one at Harvard, and Princeton, AEI and a couple at the Wall Street Journal -- all show that if we bring down our top rates and actually go across the board -- bring down rates for everyone in America -- but also limit deductions and exemptions for people at the high end, you can keep the progressivity in the code, you can remain revenue neutral and you create an enormous incentive for growth in the economy.""

For this fact-check, we will look at these five studies. Our focus is on whether Romney is correct that they show Romney’s tax plan can cut rates and still bring in the same amount of money as today without raising taxes on the middle class.

The Romney campaign sent us links to five items. One was a Wall Street Journal article from Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and an adviser to the Romney campaign; one was from Harvey Rosen, an economist at the Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies at Princeton University; one was by Matt Jensen, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank; and two were Wall Street Journal editorials.

All five criticize the Tax Policy Center for making certain assumptions or ignoring particular data. The point of all five is that the numbers do in fact add up for Romney’s plan.

Briefly, that plan would cut individual and corporate rates, eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, give savings and investment income preferential treatment, and still keep total tax revenues the same. The Tax Policy Center concludes that in order to do all of that, taxes on middle income taxpayers would have to rise.

In this item, we will take each of the five studies on Romney’s list in turn, with responses from the Tax Policy Center where available.

Martin Feldstein, Harvard University ""Romney’s tax plan can raise revenue""

Feldstein, the Romney adviser, uses 2009 data from the IRS to demonstrate that Romney can meet all his goals and not increase taxes on the middle class. First he estimates the lost revenue due to Romney’s 20 percent across the board rate cut and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Feldstein figures that would be $186 billion.

Romney says he would offset those losses by eliminating or reducing deductions for higher income taxpayers. Some of the big ones are the home mortgage deduction, charitable giving, and state and local taxes. So Feldstein’s next step is to look at how much money could be tapped from that pot.

At this point, he makes an important decision. He defines high-income as households making $100,000 or more. The Tax Policy Center sets the bar at $200,000 and anyone making less is part of the middle class. There is a significant amount of money tied up in that $100,000 to $200,000 range.

In 2009, Feldstein says, the total value of itemized deductions for households making $100,000 and up was about $636 billion. Feldstein picks a mid-point for the tax rate of these households, 30 percent, and assumes all of that could potentially end up in the government’s coffers.

""What do we get when we apply a 30 percent marginal tax rate to the $636 billion in itemized deductions,"" Feldstein asks. ""Extra revenue of $191 billion—more than enough to offset the revenue losses from the individual income tax cuts proposed by Gov. Romney.""

Feldstein underscores that he isn’t advocating such a move. He only notes that eliminating deductions, or broadening the tax base as it is called, can net huge returns.

The response

The Tax Policy Center countered that Feldstein needs to go after the deductions used by less affluent people -- those making between $100,000 and $200,000 -- in order to make the books balance.

The center analysts also note that this assumes these people would not be allowed to take even the basic standard deduction. They further challenge Feldstein’s use of the 30 percent tax rate, saying a more accurate estimate is 24 percent. The combined impact of retaining the standard deduction and the lower rate, they say, leaves Feldstein $70 billion short of the revenues lost through the rest of Romney’s tax cuts.

Harvey Rosen, Princeton University ""Growth, distribution and tax reform: Thoughts on the Romney proposal""

Rosen’s main point is that any assessment of the Romney tax plan that ignores its impact on economic growth is incomplete. ""This is curious,"" Rosen said, ""because increasing growth is the motivation for the proposal in the first place."" Growth creates more income for the government to tax which would help offset the revenues lost through rate cuts.

Rosen said he’s not alone in thinking this oversight is odd. He said economists he spoke to were ""incredulous when I told them that the numbers being discussed in the press are based on calculations that explicitly rule out any changes in labor supply or saving behavior.""  

Rosen readily admits that no one can accurately predict the future so he runs the numbers using three growth rates for GDP - 3 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent. By comparison, the White House budget planners assume an average rate of close to 3 percent.

Like Feldstein, he used 2009 data. Unlike Feldstein, he analyzed what happens for taxpayers making $100,000 and up, and then repeated it for those making $200,000 and up.

Rosen found that when all possible deductions are eliminated, from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits, it means that increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax cuts.

There is only one scenario where Rosen saw a wrinkle -- when households making less than $200,000 are shielded from the loss of deductions under certain tax and growth assumptions. Rosen saw a $28 billion gap and said ""maintaining an approximately constant tax burden on high-income individuals would be more challenging."" But not ""mathematically impossible.""

The response

Some news organizations noted the Tax Policy Center did factor in higher growth in its original study. It used a model developed by a Romney adviser, Gregory Mankiw, and found that while growth softened the burden on people making less money, the shift is still there.

""Our results are not qualitatively different, even if we include additional taxes generated from the growth effects,"" the authors wrote.

The center said groups including the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation take a cautious approach on assuming that tax changes alone will lead to new growth. This is particularly true when tax cuts are combined with base-broadening, which lies at the heart of the Romney plan. The center pointed to a study from two American Enterprise Institute economists that found the two changes largely cancel each other out, leaving effective tax rates about the same and thus have little impact on growth.

Matt Jensen, American Enterprise Institute, ""How the Tax Policy Center could improve its Romney tax study""

Jensen challenges the Tax Policy Center findings on two fronts. First, he said it should have considered the elimination of two tax breaks that the center’s analysts said ""were off the table."" One is the interest on state and local bonds; the other is interest on life insurance policies.

""Both of these exclusions largely benefit the wealthy,"" Jensen said. ""Added together their repeal would net upwards of $90 billion that could be redistributed to lower-income individuals."" Jensen called his analysis ""nothing if not rough.""

Jensen also said the center’s definition of who is high-income is arbitrary. Rather than declare everyone over $200,000 as high income, he suggested the center show the lowest income level at which the Romney plan  would work out mathematically.

The response

The Tax Policy Center challenged Jensen’s ""rough"" $90 billion figure. It said a more accurate figure would be $25 billion.

Wall Street Journal Editorial No. 1, ""The Romney Hood Fairy Tale""

This editorial largely draws on other work. It echoed Jensen’s criticism that the Tax Policy Center failed to consider certain tax breaks. It labeled the center authors as ""class warriors""  and charged that  the center ""ignores the history of tax cutting.""

""Every major marginal rate income tax cut of the last 50 years,"" said the editorial writer, ""1964, 1981, 1986 and 2003 — was followed by an unexpectedly large increase in tax revenues, a surge in taxes paid by the rich, and a more progressive tax code—i.e., the share of taxes paid by the richest 1 percent rose.""

It cited the work of Feldstein and scoffed at the center’s treatment of the impact of Romney’s plan on people making less than $30,000. Currently, many who work for little pay get money back at the end of the year through tax credits.

""The claim is that reducing various refundable tax credits that are cash payments from the government are a 'tax increase,'"" said the editorial writer. ""By this logic, reducing unemployment benefits or food stamps would also be a tax increase.""

The editorial also said the center’s findings are ""refuted by President Obama's own Simpson-Bowles deficit commission report. The Romney plan of cutting the top tax rate to 28 percent and closing loopholes to pay for it is conceptually very close to what Simpson-Bowles recommended.""

 The response

The Tax Policy Center said there are great differences between Romney’s tax plan and both the 1986 tax law and the Simpson-Bowles commission. Mainly, Romney would continue to tax capital gains and dividends at low rates and he would eliminate the estate tax.

The 1986 law treated capital gains as ordinary income and retained the estate tax. The Simpson-Bowles proposal did too.

Wall Street Journal Editorial No. 2, ""Mathematically possible"" 
This editorial largely focused on the matter of the overlooked loopholes and relies on the work of Jensen at the American Enterprise Institute. So although Romney treated it as a fifth ""study,"" it is essentially redundant of Jensen's analysis.

Comparing the methods behind the studies

Not all studies are created equal. The Tax Policy Center used a complex computer model that took over 150,000 individual tax records from 2004 and simulated the impact of Romney’s tax plan in 2015. The researchers cited by Romney relied on 2009 information and worked with large summary numbers, not individual returns.

Did it make a difference? Maybe not.

""You like to use a micro-simulation when you can,"" said  Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley, ""but you often get approximately the right answer with those larger aggregated numbers.""

Auerbach also said there is no clear dividing line that separates high-income households from all others. The Tax Policy Center chose $200,000 -- but different breakpoints could also be valid.

However, the use of 2009 versus 2004 data was pivotal. The researchers cited by Romney said they used 2009 tax information because it was the most current. But that doesn’t necessarily make it better. Indeed, 2009 was the bottom of the recession  

In pure dollar amounts, upper income households saw more of a drop because a lot of their income comes from investments and investments suffered. In 2009, they had less income that would benefit from the lower rates Romney proposes.

Accordingly, the cost of a tax cut would be smaller and so would the amount you would need to pick up by getting rid of tax deductions and other tax breaks as Romney has said he wants.

""It would be easier to do in 2009,"" Auerbach said.

Auerbach said, ""If you think the future will look more like a non-recession year, then you would want to use data from a pre-recession year.""

We asked him whether editorials count as studies. ""I don’t pay much attention to editorials,"" Auerbach said. ""They refer back to other research and they’re just opinion.""

Our ruling

Romney said that five studies show that his tax plan can cut rates and still bring in the same amount of money as today without raising taxes on the middle class.

Romney is using the word ""studies"" generously. Two items on his list are newspaper editorials that can be analytical but are rarely treated as independent research. One article comes from a campaign adviser, a connection that generally suggests a less than independent assessment.  That leaves just two reports out Romney’s five.

There is a fair argument to be made that the Tax Policy Center used an arbitrary dividing line of $200,000 to separate high-income households from all others. The same problem lies in setting the breakpoint at $100,000, a choice preferred by at least one of the defenders of Romney’s proposal.

The studies from Feldstein and Rosen use 2009 data.  That was an abnormal year and one that made it easier to make the math work for the Romney plan. The analysts could have chosen other years but decided not to.

We see no more than two independent studies out of the five claimed. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/14/mitt-romney/romney-claims-5-studies-back-his-tax-plan/

Mitt Romney ad blames Barack Obama for Florida housing woes
","
A new Romney campaign ad poses the ""Are you better off?"" question to a particularly hard-hit population: Florida homeowners.

Against a black and white image of Obama, a narrator says, ""Here in Florida, we’re not better off under President Obama. Home values collapsed, home construction jobs lost, high rate of foreclosure.""

Mitt Romney, the ad promises, will provide an antidote to all these ills: alternatives to foreclosure, an end to the mortgage lending freeze and 700,000 new jobs for Florida. (We contacted both campaigns for comment on the ad, but didn't hear back.)

In a state where homes lost more than half their value in the recession, it’s a handy line of attack. But we found that the claim -- faulting Obama for depressed house values, lost jobs and high foreclosures -- oversimplifies a problem with many layers and puts too much blame on the president for a crisis that began before he took office.

'Home values collapsed'

We’ll start by examining home values. The ad cited Zillow, a real estate website, as backup for the claim. We talked to their head economist, Stan Humphries, who shared some interesting statistics.

Home values in Florida began rising in earnest in 2003 and 2004. That accelerated through 2005, hitting a peak in May 2006. The median home value in Florida that month: $257,800.

Since that time, the median value has plummeted by 51.2 percent through July 2012, to $125,700.

So yes, home values have declined during Obama’s term. But there’s more to the story.

Humphries pointed out that the decline under Obama so far amounts to 22.3 percent. Under his predecessor, George W. Bush, Florida home values fell 35.5 percent.

""More of those declines happened on Bush’s watch than on Obama’s watch,"" Humphries said.

Here’s another thing to note about the Obama years: Home values in Florida bottomed out in October 2011. (Median price: $122,400). They’ve been climbing since, and in the past year they inched up 1.3 percent. Zillow forecasts an appreciation rate of 6 percent in Miami, 2.3 percent in Tampa and 2.8 percent in Orlando. That’s better than the expectation for the nation as a whole, Humphries said.

'Home construction jobs lost'

For data on construction jobs, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In the past decade, construction jobs in Florida enjoyed steady growth, hitting a peak in June 2006 of 691,900. They began to steadily decline at that point, shedding 100,000 jobs by October of 2007 and another 100,000 by September 2008.

The most recent jobs figure is for July 2012: 308,800.

But a closer look at those numbers reveals this:

• Jobs lost from the peak until Obama took office: 231,000

• Jobs lost since he took office: 138,200

Notice too that the timeline for construction layoffs parallels the decline of home values -- a peak in mid 2006, followed by a steady drop-off.

""When housing prices started to fall, (there was) no need to build new homes,"" said Ken Thomas, an independent bank consultant and economist in Miami. ""It was the housing crisis, the collapse of the housing bubble, that basically did in the construction workers.""

'High rate of foreclosure'

According to RealtyTrac, a website that collects and tracks foreclosure data, the Florida foreclosure wave crashed ashore about a year after home values collapsed.

In May 2006 (the month home values peaked), Florida had 7,455 new foreclosure filings. In May 2007, that figure leapt to 17,000, a 128 percent increase. Filings didn’t slow down for a long time. Several months in 2009 saw more than 30,000 new cases.

Only in mid 2010, when the robo-signing scandal among banks came to light, was there a noticeable drop-off. Banks ceased new filings as they re-assessed their practices. And since then? Foreclosures are on the way up again. RealtyTrac found that Florida’s foreclosure rate in August 2012 jumped to second highest in the country, with 14,726 new filings. That means one in every 328 housing units under a foreclosure notice. 
Here's how the foreclosures appear relative to Obama: 
• From May 2007 (beginning of the increase) to January 2009 (when he took office): 519,977 new filings 
• From February 2009 (his first full month in office) to August 2012: 866,938 new filings 
""Unlike other foreclosure cycles in the past, this wasn’t the result of a bad economy. It was the excesses in the housing market in terms of prices and overbuilding,"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac.

 Added Humphries: ""The foreclosure rates are a natural consequence of home value loss of 50 percent. That leaves a huge amount of negative equity. That is what fuels a lot of foreclosures.""

Blame game

So who’s a weary homeowner to blame?

Here’s Ken Harney, a syndicated real estate columnist:

""Blaming Obama for property value declines that were underway during the Bush administration, and caused in part by financial regulators who were asleep in the cockpit during the Bush years, is ridiculous,"" Harney told PolitiFact. ""The Obama administration is open to criticism for the poorly designed, timid and poorly executed foreclosure-prevention and loan modification efforts it created following the housing bust, but had nothing to do with the underlying problems that took down Florida's hyperinflated property values.""

So while it’s clear Obama didn’t cause these troubles, what did he do to fix them? As we’ve previously reported, he pursued a number of remedies, with only modest success.

The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, which Obama signed in 2009, makes it a federal crime to make a materially false statement on a mortgage application or to willfully overvalue a property to influence any action by a mortgage lending business. PolitiFact's Obameter gave that a Promise Kept on our Obameter. And new standards for helping people understand their mortgage were included in the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul passed in 2010, another Promise Kept.
   
But he's had limited success with efforts that would have provided the most help to homeowners. A temporary foreclosure moratorium in early 2009 halted filings while banks waited for the new administration to get its plan in place to address the crisis. It’s not clear, though, that it ultimately kept many people out of foreclosure. Analysts say a change in bankruptcy law that Obama sought to allow judges to modify individual loans could have made a significant difference, but it died in Congress.
   
A foreclosure prevention fund was the heart of Obama’s promise. He originally pledged $10 billion but ended up setting aside $75 billion, using TARP funds. He predicted the money would assist 9 million homeowners. But after three years, far fewer have won permanent mortgage help. We rated that Promise Broken.
   
Our ruling

Romney’s ad claims that under Obama, home values in Florida collapsed, construction jobs were lost and the state’s foreclosure rate soared.

This much is true: The median home value in Florida has dropped by more than half; 300,000-plus construction jobs have disappeared and the Sunshine State continues to rack up a large number of foreclosure filings.

But each one of those trends began well before Obama was elected. Analysts say they have been driven by a natural and inevitable market correction much more than by any government policies. But since the ad draws a cause/effect relationship -- the cause being Obama’s presidency, the effect being a sour housing market -- it’s worth noting that more of the decline in home values happened on Bush’s watch, and in the last year Florida housing has again begun to appreciate.

At PolitiFact, claims that cite a true statistic but apply misplaced blame on a politician or office holder are commonly rated Half True. We think this three-part claim stretches the truth even further. Homeowners in Florida who have watched their property value sink and their neighbors’ houses abandoned in foreclosure know this didn’t start when Obama walked into the White House. They’re in at least year seven of this grim reality.

Romney’s ad leaves out many critical facts to create a misleading impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/14/mitt-romney/romney-ad-blames-obama-florida-housing-woes/

Rick Scott touts phase-out of FCAT in TV ad
","
Before Gov. Rick Scott hit the road on his education listening tour, he went to the airwaves to toss in his own two cents about Florida’s high-stakes testing system.

Scott appeared in a TV commercial paid for by the Republican Party of Florida as the school year started, touting the GOP Legislature’s roughly $1 billion increase in education funding (a year after cutting more than that amount) and his own willingness to hear criticism.

His message: He’s heard the concerns about the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, and change is on the way.

""I've listened to the frustrations parents and teachers have with the FCAT,"" Scott said. ""Next year we begin improving our testing system. No more teaching to the test. It's time we get a better measure of our children's progress.""

So is Scott taking action to improve testing and end teaching to the test?

Actually, we found new education standards and assessments were in the works before he took office.

Just about every state has agreed to adopt new education standards in language arts and math known as Common Core, a bipartisan product from the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers.

Florida’s Board of Education adopted Common Core standards in summer 2010, as Scott fought through his Republican gubernatorial primary.

These standards are not an effort to nationalize curriculum, though federal leaders like Education Secretary Arne Duncan like them because they are more rigorous and lend themselves to apples-to-apples comparisons for students across the states. Many states, including Florida, have received Race to the Top money for adopting these standards.

To measure student comprehension of these standards, a consortium of 23 states and the Virgin Islands developed a new testing system for students from third grade through high school paid for by a $186 million Race to the Top grant. The new system is known as the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC for short.

PARCC will gradually replace the FCAT, but that’s not Scott’s doing.

Scott’s back-to-school message ""was a little like the drum major who jumps in front of a parade that's already marching down Main Street,"" wrote Orlando Sentinel columnist Scott Maxwell in August.

""It’s certainly not a reaction to parents that we’re doing this,"" said Mark Pudlow, a spokesman for the Florida Education Association.

In the ad, Scott is vague about what changes are coming to Florida’s testing system next year. 

These new PARCC tests don’t fully kick in until spring 2015. What happens between then and now -- such as field-testing and piloting the new exams -- is purely transitional.

Fifth and eighth graders will take a tougher version of the FCAT for science. Students will also be taking new end-of-course assessments in various subjects, including civics, U.S. history, algebra I, biology I and geometry.

PARCC offers optional assessments to participating states, including a mid-year exam. While it’s possible more tests will be added over time, ""it’s not likely that everything that is developed will be implemented in Florida,"" said Mary Jane Tappen, Florida Department of Education deputy chancellor for curriculum, instruction, and student services.

Scott elaborates on the testing switch in a statement, saying he remains a ""staunch advocate of student testing"" and supports PARCC because the material ""emphasizes analytical problem solving over memorization and simple recitation of facts.""

Indeed, the new tests will require students to show their work on math problems and defend their analyses of literary passages.

So what has Scott done relating to the retooled assessments? Upon taking office, he recommitted Florida to these standards and ""re-signed the PARCC Memorandum of Understanding,"" said Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman Kristen McDonald.

She pointed to other examples of the state’s progression toward the new testing system under Scott, including the department training 8,000 education professionals over the summer and the state college system being the first in the country to work Common Core into its teacher-training curriculum.

The new standards are already being worked in schools, Tappen said.

As an aside, we wanted to address Scott’s ""no more teaching to the test"" rhetoric. It won’t be the last time you hear him say it, even though it’s actually been illegal for a while.

Florida lawmakers made it against the law for teachers to stop regular class for FCAT prep in 2008. Still, given the stakes, some do. And starting teachers will have a portion of their pay tied to student performance in a couple of years, so the stakes are higher for them, too. A fear of teachers ""teaching to the test"" has not dissipated for some school advocates.

Our ruling 
Scott’s commercial leaves viewers with the impression that changes are coming to Florida’s standardized testing system because of him. Really, Florida’s shift from FCAT toward PARCC and end-of-course exams was in the works long before he came on the political scene. Scott is affirming a movement started by Florida’s former Education Commissioner Eric Smith.

Summers says appeals court judges used to be picked by ""a handful of party officials""
","
Paul Summers, who served as Tennessee's attorney general from 1999 through 2006, re-entered debate over how the state should select its top judges recently with an opinion article provided to newspapers that advocates continuation of the present system.

While we don't argue with opinions, in the course of stating his case for the present ""merit selection"" of appellate court judges Summers made an assertion of fact that may be of interest as debate escalates toward decision-making time in the Legislature next year.

Summers' piece, as published in the News Sentinel, begins with the adage that, ""If you do not know history, you are bound to repeat it."" A bit further down, he states:

""Back when we had partisan elections for the judges of the appellate courts, they were in theory elected by hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans. In truth, they were selected by a handful of party officials in Nashville in January every eight years.""

Along the same lines: ""Proponents of popular elections say that a handful of politicians should not be selecting our highest 29 judges. They say the people ought to decide. Apparently they aren't aware, or just ignore, the fact that a handful of politicians selected the appellate judges before merit selection became law in 1971.""

Does Summers have his history right?

Asked to elaborate, Summers, the son of an appeals court judge, said in an interview that he had in mind relatively recent history and especially the process for selecting state Supreme Court judges.

A bit of longer-term history may be in order, largely based on ""A History of the Tennessee Supreme Court"",published by the University of Tennessee Press in 2002. The book covers the period 1776-1998
From statehood until 1854, the state Legislature appointed Tennessee's top judges. In the latter year, voters approved a constitutional amendment – initiated in the Legislature a year earlier – providing instead for popular election.

That remained the case until 1971, when the General Assembly approved a statute – not a constitutional amendment – setting up what was called the ""Modified Missouri Plan."" The system calls for prospective judges to be screened by a commission, which then submits a list of names of the persons deemed best qualified to the governor. The governor then appoints the judge of his choice.

But two years later, with Republican Gov. Winfield Dunn in office and positioned to make appointments, the Democrat-controlled General Assembly repealed the new law insofar as applying to Supreme Court justices. It was left in effect for judges of the Court of Appeals and Court of Criminal Appeals.

In 1994, the General Assembly voted – again by enacting a statute – to put the Supreme Court back under the commission nominating/gubernatorial appointment process, making a few other relatively minor changes and calling the procedure ""the Tennessee plan.""

Under the plan, when a judge's term ends after an appointment, he or she goes up for reelection on a yes-no basis. If a majority of voters statewide say yes in the ""retention election,"" the judge gets a new term.

Today, the Tennessee Plan is still in effect – but possibly not for long. The Judicial Nominating Commission, which submits names to the governor, will cease to exist on June 30, 2013, unless the Legislature votes to extend its life before then. This comes with all appellate judge positions coming up in the eight-year cycle for a retention election cycle in August 2014. There are conflicting proposals – ranging from a constitutional amendment for a revised system to a return to contested elections – about what the Legislature should do next year.

While the future of Tennessee judge selection is muddled, hindsight can be fairly clear.

Summers says that, in writing his article, the standout case of judge selection by a ""handful of politicians"" came in 1990, when the state Democratic Party's 66-member Executive Committee chose a slate of five Supreme Court candidates for the party nomination.

Early in that year, two of the five incumbent Supreme Court justices stepped aside, reportedly after failing to gather enough political support among party activists on the Democratic Executive Committee. The Democratic nominees wound up being the only candidates on the ballot and were elected to full eight-year terms.

That was clearly a case where, as Summers states, a majority of the committee – 34 of the 66 members, or a ""handful of party officials"" if you will – was able to choose Supreme Court justices.

But that was not always the case when partisan, contested elections were part of the picture.

Eight years before the 1990 scenario, the Republican party in 1982 put up a slate of three party nominees chosen by the Republican Executive Committee. The Democrats won in all the races.

In 1980, following the death of a sitting justice, then-Gov. Lamar Alexander appointed appointed George H. Brown of Memphis as Tennessee's first black member of the court. That set up a special election later in the year between Brown, as the Republican nominee, and the Democratic Executive Committee's nominee, Frank Drowota, and independent candidate Larry Parrish of Memphis, known as an anti-pornography crusader.

Drowota won with 50 percent of the vote versus 38 percent for Brown and 12 percent for Parrish. Brown was one of the GOP nominees in the 1982 race, too.

There had also been a contested Supreme Court election in 1974, when Republicans nominated candidates for all five positions. They all lost.

With Democrats dominating the state, Republicans had apparently stopped trying in 1990. In today's political environment, Summers suggests that the Republican Executive Committee will pick the Supreme Court if there is a return to partisan elections.

Summers also pointed out to us a speech by C.S. Carneyto the 1977 Tennessee Constitutional Convention, which drafted a constitutional amendment on judicial selection subsequently rejected by the voters. Carney had served as a Court of Appeals judge under the old system and won back his seat under the retention election system instituted in 1971.

In the speech, Carney criticized the partisan election system, saying it was dependent on political favor and not ability. Relative to this discussion, he also said there had been no exceptions to the rule of the Democratic Executive Committee picking Supreme Court justices since 1910.

In that year, though, there was an extraordinarily contested election. The Supreme Court had upheld a controversial murder conviction, only to have Gov. Malcolm Patterson pardon the killer. The ensuing uproar led to a split in Democratic ranks and qualifying a slate of ""independent"" Supreme Court candidates – and some for other appellate courts as well - backed by the splinter Democrats and Republicans. The independents won every seat and the related turmoil is widely credited as well for the election of a Republican, Ben Hooper, as governor. He was the last Republican to hold the office until Dunn, whose election led to enactment of the ""Modified Missouri plan"" in 1971.

It appears then, that appellate court were mostly selected by a relatively small number of politicians when the partisan election system was in place. But not always.

In 1910, in the 1970s and in the 1980s, top judicial elections were decided by voters who had a choice to override the decisions of that handful of politicians. So the voters ultimately decided in those cases, not the nominating committee.

Still, that leaves party powers giving voters no choice from the years after Reconstruction – during which the judges were appointed by governors under federal oversight – up until 1910. And then again until the 1970s, as best we can tell.

That leaves us viewing Summers statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/14/paul-summers/summers-says-appeals-court-judges-used-be-picked-h/

Obama auto rescue saved 28,000 ""middle-class"" jobs in Wisconsin, 1 million in U.S., ex-Michigan governor says
","
In a high-volume, arm-pumping speech at the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6, 2012, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm proclaimed that President Barack Obama saved the American automobile industry.

It’s a claim, made repeatedly at the convention, that PolitiFact National has said is on pretty solid ground.

But Granholm got more specific.

""With the auto rescue,"" Obama ""saved more than 1 million middle-class jobs all across America,"" said Granholm.

She continued by claiming jobs saved in a number of states, such as the election battlegrounds of Florida (35,000), Michigan (211,000) and Ohio (150,000). She said more than 28,000 jobs were saved in Wisconsin alone.

For us, Granholm’s claim really has three parts: the U.S. and Wisconsin jobs-saved figures; whether those jobs were ""middle-class""; and whether Obama deserves full credit for saving the jobs.

Let’s turn the ignition.

Auto industry crisis

Granholm, now a law professor and host of a talk show on Current TV, is a Democrat who served eight years as Michigan’s governor after being elected in 2002. She alluded in her speech to late 2008, when the auto industry was near collapse. As PolitiFact National has reported, layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track that year to reach 250,000 workers. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind.

(Granholm stated in her speech that Republican Mitt Romney’s response at the time was to ""Let Detroit go bankrupt."" But as our colleagues noted in rating that claim Half True, it was a New York Times staff writer who put that headline on an opinion piece penned by Romney in which he advocated a ""managed bankruptcy"" with new management, new labor agreements and federal guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing.)

The auto rescue began under President George W. Bush, who just before leaving office gave Chrysler and GM more than $17 billion in loans. (Ford never asked for assistance.) Then in 2009, Obama provided $80 billion in relief. Some was offered as loans to the automakers, but much more was given in exchange for stock.

The Italian car company Fiat became the majority stockholder of Chrysler; the second-largest owner is the autoworker union’s retiree health care trust fund. For GM, the U.S. government now owns about one-third of the company, private shareholders about one-third and the retiree trust fund 10 percent.

Number of jobs saved

Obama’s campaign said the evidence for Granholm’s claim comes from a May 2009 study produced by the Center for Automotive Research. The center is an independent research group based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that gets some funding from automakers.

The study, released as the auto bailout was still playing out, made projections based on whether Chrysler and GM went through quick bankruptcies (""best-case"" scenario) or lengthy bankruptcies (""worst-case"" scenario).

Under the best-case scenario -- bankruptcy filings and settlement with debtors completed within 90 days -- an estimated 63,200 U.S. jobs would have been lost by the end of 2009, the study said. That included 9,700 direct jobs, with the rest coming from automaker suppliers and ""spin-off"" jobs -- jobs lost as a result of reduced spending by auto and auto-supplier employees.

Under the ""worst-case"" scenario -- bankruptcy proceedings that were ""disruptive and disorderly"" and would ""drag on"" -- the U.S. would have lost 1.34 million jobs by the end of 2009, including nearly 204,000 direct auto jobs, the study estimated.

For Wisconsin, the 2009 jobs loss was pegged at 1,766 under the best-case scenario and 30,513 under the worst-case scenario.

Granholm then did some math, subtracting the best-case jobs number from the worst-case number. For example, for Wisconsin, she claimed the bailout saved more than 28,000 middle-class jobs (30,513 minus 1,765 equals 28,748).

The math Granholm did isn’t done in the study. And it’s not clear if she was trying to be conservative by citing figures slightly smaller than the maximums. But Obama’s  campaign did respond to our question on this point by noting that the Center for Automotive Research did a later study, in November 2010, estimating that the auto rescue -- by avoiding the worst-case scenario with drawn-out bankruptcy proceedings -- saved an estimated 1.14 million U.S. jobs, slightly fewer than the earlier estimate of 1.3 million jobs. 
Kim Hill, associate research director of the Center for Automotive Research, noted that other studies also produced estimates of more than 1 million U.S. jobs being at stake. They included one study from the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank, and another from the University of Maryland. 
But the Center for Automotive Research study Granholm relies on provided a range of job loss predictions, and Granholm chooses numbers that best serve her rhetorical purpose. Moreover, the study's figures were estimates, not actual counts of jobs saved.

There’s no way to know whether close to the worst-case scenario would have emerged had Obama not provided the auto rescue. And the alternate scenario outlined in the same report showed a much smaller potential job loss.

Types of jobs saved

The study Granholm cited did not use middle-class or any similar term in describing the jobs saved -- and it’s a term that many people interpret differently.

Hill, of the Center for Automotive Research, told us that more than half of the projected jobs saved could easily be classified as middle-class, given that average annual salary and fringe benefits exceed $60,000 for auto workers and $40,000 for auto supplier workers.

But to claim that all of the more 1 million jobs saved were middle class ""gets to be a stretch,"" he said.

Obama’s role

As for credit for saving jobs, Granholm gave it all to Obama.

But Obama doesn’t get full credit because Bush’s aid to Chrysler and GM kept them afloat and bought time for Obama to decide how to respond to the crisis, PolitiFact National concluded in its article about whether Obama saved the auto industry. Moreover, our colleagues observed, no one can say what would have happened without massive government intervention.

Our rating

Granholm said that ""with the auto rescue,"" Obama ""saved more than 1 million middle-class jobs all across America,"" including more than 28,000 in Wisconsin.

The two figures are drawn from estimates from an independent study -- but: it’s not certain that job losses would have reached those levels without the rescue; not all of the jobs projected as saved were middle-class jobs; and Obama deserves a major share of the credit for saving jobs, not all of it.

Granholm’s claim was partially accurate but left out important details. On balance, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/14/jennifer-granholm/obama-auto-rescue-saved-28000-middle-class-jobs-wi/

Unemployment rate comparable to Great Depression, congressman says
","
Many Republicans quickly pounced on the federal government’s latest unemployment data as proof that President Barack Obama should be removed from his current job by voters on Election Day.

The August report showed about 96,000 jobs were added across the country that month and the nation’s unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.1 percent. Many economists, though, said the numbers were below projections. Obama said he was dissatisfied with the numbers, but he pointed out that the nation has seen 30 consecutive months of job growth.

U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Republican from Marietta, had a different observation about the unemployment data and claimed in a Twitter post it was part of a longer sort of streak.

""Today's #jobs report marks the 43rd consecutive month unemployment has remained above 8%, longest since the Great Depression,"" the post read.

Gingrey ended the tweet with his conclusion about how the nation has fared since Obama, a Democrat, took office in January 2009.

""[N]ot better off,"" he wrote.

There’s been plenty of ink spilled in newspapers and magazines that the nation’s unemployment rate has been above 8 percent for a long time. But we wondered if the congressman was correct to say this is the longest stretch the unemployment rate has been above 8 percent since the Great Depression.

First, let’s look at the current unemployment situation. We examined the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate data, which Gingrey, Obama and everyone else use for such comparisons. The numbers are trusted by most economists, although some contend the data doesn’t tell the entire story because, for example, the unemployment rate doesn’t include people who’ve quit looking for a job.

In February 2009, Obama’s first full month in office, the unemployment rate rose to 8.3 percent. It had been 7.8 percent the month before. The unemployment rate rose sharply to a high of 10 percent by that October.

The unemployment rate was greater than 9 percent the next 16 months. In March 2011, it dropped to 8.9 percent, but rose back above 9 percent the following six months. In October 2011, the rate fell back below 9 percent. Each month since, it has been in the 8 percent range.

The last time the U.S. unemployment rate topped the 8 percent mark was during the first term of Republican Ronald Reagan’s presidency. In November 1981, it rose to 8.3 percent and remained over that mark for 27 consecutive months, reaching a high of 10.8 percent in late 1982. The unemployment rate dropped to 7.8 percent in February 1984 and was 5.4 percent when Reagan left the White House in January 1989.

Federal government data shows prior to the Reagan administration, you must indeed go back to the Great Depression to find unemployment at such high rates. In 1930, the annual unemployment rate for the United States was 8.7 percent. The annual rate ballooned to nearly 25 percent by 1933. The unemployment rate gradually declined until 1937, when it rose from 14.3 to 19 percent. Some economic historians blame the increase on President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s spending cuts in June 1937.

University of Maryland associate history professor David Sicilia noted Roosevelt increased spending soon thereafter. The unemployment rate did not fall back under 8 percent until 1942, when it was 4.7 percent. Pearl Harbor was attacked in December 1941, drawing America completely into World War II and much of the nation’s young men into combat and putting many of its women to work.

Sicilia sees some similarities between how the unemployment numbers have trended during the Great Depression and since 2009. He said the nation is more conservative now than it was during the Depression, so there is greater resistance to government spending increases to spur the economy and lower the unemployment rate.

As for the accuracy of Gingrey’s claim, Sicilia said, ""That’s correct.""

The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan source of analysis, wrote in February that this was the longest period of unemployment above 8 percent since the Great Depression.

The last time the unemployment rate was this high was during Reagan’s first term. However, the 27 months during the 1980s the rate was greater than 8 percent is far less than the 11 years the unemployment rate was that high during the Great Depression.

Marcia Fudge says black voters cast 56 percent of Greater Cleveland's early weekend ballots in 2008
","
After some Ohio voters - including many in Cuyahoga County - faced hours-long voting lines during the 2004 presidential election, the state adopted reforms intended to prevent future backups, such as allowing extended time before elections for voters to cast in-person ballots at county elections boards.

President Barack Obama’s 2008 voter mobilization effort made particular use of voting the Sunday before elections, as African-American churches organized ""Souls to the Polls"" events which brought worshippers to vote after religious services.

Since then, Ohio’s Republican-controlled state legislature and GOP Secretary of State Jon Husted have cited budgetary concerns in making several efforts to reduce in-person early voting hours, engendering an uproar that included a federal lawsuit.

On August 31, a federal judge ordered restoration of in-person early voting for the three days before election day, but Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine filed an appeal. Rep. Marcia Fudge and other Democrats have maintained Republicans want to eliminate that weekend’s early voting to cut turnout among African-Americans -- a claim Republicans deny.

But in a recent news release from Fudge and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Fudge spoke to how much minority voters relied on early voting.

""It’s troubling that by eliminating weekend voting hours, the state of Ohio specifically banned a popular voting time of choice for minorities,"" Fudge said. ""In Cuyahoga County, which I represent, 56 percent of weekend voters in 2008 were African American while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population.""

PolitiFact Ohio thought Fudge’s data on African American use of in-person early voting warranted a closer look. Cuyahoga County, home to Cleveland and Fudge’s hometown of Warrensville Heights, is the most populous and had the largest voting population among Ohio counties in 2008.

We asked Fudge’s office where she got her statistics. Her staff referred us to a research study on early voting by Case Western Reserve University emeritus professor Norman Robbins, and Cleveland State University urban affairs professor Mark Salling.

Their study estimates that 56.4 percent of Cuyahoga county’s 2008 early-in-person voters were black. Of those who voted on election day or by mail, 25.7 percent of them were black. And specifically, the study found that on the four weekends prior to election day, 56 percent of the ballots were cast by black voters.

White voters showed the reverse pattern, it said. They comprised 40 percent of early-in-person votes and 69.4 percent of those who voted on election day or by mail.

The study said that 15.6 percent of all votes cast by African Americans in Cuyahoga County were through early-in-person voting, compared with 4.5 percent of votes by whites.

The study also said that 28 percent of Cuyahoga county adults 18 and over are African American, as are 24 percent of voting age adults in Hamilton County (Cincinnati), and 20 percent each in Franklin (Columbus) and Montgomery (Dayton) counties.

""We conclude that in Cuyahoga County, and quite probably in other counties with substantial black populations, elimination of ANY EIP (early-in-person) voting period clearly disproportionately affects African Americans in an election similar to 2008,"" the study said.

In an email to PolitiFact Ohio, study co-author Robbins observed that African-American turnout was ""disproportionately high and approximately the same, ranging from about 54 to 59 percent"" during every early voting time period - business hours, extended weekday hours, weekends, or the last three days before the election.

On the final weekend before election day, Robbins said, 58.9 percent of early in-person voters in Cuyahoga county were African-American. During the four weekends before that, he said 56.3 percent of voters were African-American.

PolitiFact Ohio queried Cuyahoga County Election Board Director Jane Platten about the study’s statistics. She said she couldn’t evaluate its racial voting numbers because the county doesn’t collect data on the voters’ ethnicity. She said ""a lot"" of African Americans made use of the county’s early-in-person voting program, although she said she had ""no idea"" of the percentage.

So how did the authors come up with their racial data? Although the county doesn’t track voters’ race, voter addresses are on file. The study’s authors used those addresses to determine the census block where voters reside, and extrapolated their race by using  2010 census data on each block’s racial makeup. For example, if a voter’s address was in a census block in which 75 percent of the population was black and 25 percent was white, that voter was considered to have a 75 percent probability of being black.

Several independent demographics experts told PolitiFact Ohio this method would provide valid racial voting data.

""I can’t think of a better way to do it, and I don’t think there would be any big errors in that method,"" said Carl Schmertmann, a Florida State University demography professor who formerly served on the U.S. Census Bureau’s scientific advisory committee.

""The logic by which the authors attempt to estimate the race of early voters makes sense,"" agreed Scott Keeter, the Pew Research Center’s survey research director.

Keeter noted that 2008 exit polling data in Ohio found that 16 percent of those who voted early - either by mail or in-person - were black voters, while 9 percent of in-person voters were black.

""African-Americans statewide do appear to have made heavier use of early voting, but the exit poll did not ask how a vote was cast, so we can’t be sure that this pattern is mostly a result of EIP voting,"" said an email from Keeter.

Robbins research, though, was able to break out the EIP population.

Fudge drew her statistics, which she cited accurately, from a research study that stated that 56 percent of the 2008 Cuyahoga county voters voted who cast ballots on weekends before the election were African American and that 28 percent of the county’s voting age population is African American.

Brendan Doherty says incumbent U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, as Providence mayor, intentionally missed deadlines for providing information to the city's external auditors
","Republican Brendan Doherty wasted no time coming out of the starting gate for the general election race with Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline for the 1st District seat.

Less than 12 hours after Cicilline won the Sept. 11 Democratic primary, Doherty held a news conference listing Cicilline's top 10 ""most serious deceptions.""

We decided to look at number four, which focused on the outside audit of Providence finances covering the final fiscal year when Cicilline was mayor. (We’ll be examining another item in Doherty's ""top 10"" separately.)

We quote from Doherty's news release attacking Cicilline: ""INTENTIONALLY MISSED DEADLINES: You were also required to provide key information about city finances to an independent outside auditor. The deadlines were clear -- yet you missed them by months.  You delayed providing that information until after you were elected to Congress.""

Our mind-reading skills are limited, so we can't judge whether any delay was prompted by an intent to withhold information until after the Nov. 2, 2010, general election. So we e-mailed the Doherty campaign late Wednesday to see if it had any evidence to back up that part of the allegation.

Meanwhile, knowing that Cicilline has repeatedly said he is responsible for the decisions made during his tenure, we were interested in whether his administration had clear deadlines that it missed by months.

Doherty's press release cited an April 20, 2011, report, ""Corrective Action Plan to Restore Sound Financial Management,"" written by Matthew M. Clarkin Jr., the city's internal auditor after Cicilline's departure, and Gary Sasse, who worked for 30 years as executive director of the nonprofit Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council and, more recently, a fiscal adviser to the Providence City Council.

(The independent auditor does the city's official audit. The internal auditor works as a financial watchdog on behalf of the City Council.)

The report says that according to the independent auditor, Braver PC, when it was time to do the audit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, ""For the first time in more than a decade the City requested a one-month extension from the Auditor General for the 2010 audit."" State law gives cities and towns six months to complete annual audits.

According to the report, ""In August 2010, Braver submitted a list of documents and information to the Director of Finance, [documents] that were required to complete the annual audit, as well as a deadline for the submission of each item.""

On page 14, the report has a chart listing 15 types of financial information due by Oct. 12, 2010, or earlier, none of which was submitted to the auditor until after the Nov. 2 election, according to Braver. The delays ranged from about two months to about four months.

The report says the auditing firm ""was forced on several occasions to extend those deadlines. According to Braver, some of the information requested was not delivered until the day the report was released on January 31, 2011.""

The report verified that the city was in serious financial trouble.

James Wilkinson, who oversaw the audit for Braver, confirmed the information in the Clarkin / Sasse report. The city had agreed to the original deadlines, he said.

Clarkin also sent us an e-mail from Wilkinson suggesting changes in the report. Wilkinson, in fact, suggests only minor alterations to the chart showing how the deadlines were missed, and he recommends adding the note that some requested information didn't come in until the day the audit was released.

But Wilkinson also ended his e-mail with an explanation for the delays.

""This year's closing process was marked by delays and problems caused by miscommunication among the accounting personnel. We believe that the year-end closing could proceed more quickly and smoothly by developing a logical order for closing procedures and assigning responsibility for completing the procedures to specific personnel,"" he wrote. That speaks to a finance department in disarray under Cicilline, not one withholding data for political purposes, as Doherty implies.

Wilkinson said the delay in 2010 was unusual for Providence. ""They did have turnover in the finance department so there were a lot of things going on,"" he said. ""There was cooperation but it was taking a while.""

But more important, according to Wilkinson, if the city had met all of its deadlines for supplying financial information, the audit still would not have been completed before the election. It typically comes out in late December.

Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers said Doherty falsely assumed that Cicilline knew about the auditor's deadlines and that the mayor instructed his staff to miss the deadlines. ""Neither of those things happened.""

Doherty campaign spokesman Robert Coupe acknowledged that there was no smoking gun showing that Cicilline or his staff ordered a delay in the release of financial data. But the delay, he said, was part of a pattern that kept the public in the dark about the city's finances.

There ""was a consistent pattern of withholding key financial information, not only from the external auditor, but also from the internal auditor, the City Council and the Rhode Island Division of Municipal Finance,"" he said.

That shows intent, Coupe argued. This ""was not an accident but was a component of the overall pattern and therefore intentional.""

Our ruling 

Brendan Doherty said David Cicilline, when he was mayor of Providence, was ""required to provide key information about city finances to an independent outside auditor. The deadlines were clear -- yet [he intentionally] missed them by months"" until after the November 2010 election.

A subsequent report by the city on what led to its financial problems, along with a supporting e-mail from the firm that did the outside audit, support the claim that many deadlines for the outside audit were not met by the Cicilline administration.

However, Doherty declared that Cicilline intentionally withheld the information until after the election, suggesting that the delay was designed to help him get elected to Congress.

We previously gave Cicilline a Mostly False on his statement that the internal auditor for the city of Providence ""was not locked out"" of access to the city's finances. We found evidence of serious delays but ultimately, in that case, that auditor (Clarkin's predecessor) received the long-sought information before the November election.

But in this instance, involving the outside audit, we've seen no real evidence -- and Doherty provided none -- that the delays were part of an attempt by Cicilline to hide bad news from voters.

The facts argue otherwise.

The external auditor himself judged the delays to be caused by a finance department in disarray.

And even if every deadline had been met, the results of the audit would not have been released before the November election. Such audits are due at the end of the year, nearly two months after the votes are counted, a timetable noted in the very document the Doherty campaign cites.

In the end, we have the former head of the Rhode Island State Police making allegations without key evidence, and ignoring evidence that points in another direction.

Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

"['Alcohol', 'Oregon', 'Bill Kennemer']","
Are there daiquiri drive-thrus in Louisiana?
","
Oregon is a control state. Not only does the state regulate the consumption of all alcohol, but the state buys, stores and sells distilled spirits to retailers and consumers. 

That may change, with rumblings Thursday of a citizens’ initiative to loosen our uptight liquor laws if lawmakers don’t in 2013. Some legislators appeared reluctant to follow Washington state in privatizing liquor sales, as reported in a three-part series published in The Oregonian this week. State Rep. Bill Kennemer told a reporter: ""We just don't want to get to be like Louisiana, where you have drive-up daiquiri shops.""

PolitiFact Oregon wondered if perhaps Kennemer had first-hand knowledge to back up his bold statement. Because anyone who’s grown up on the West Coast and has not traveled to the South knows there’s no such thing as ordering a cocktail to go, especially from behind the wheel. (PolitiFact Oregon knows someone who knows someone who tried to order a takeaway gin-and-tonic from a San Francisco bar but was rejected, even though the person was on foot!)

It turns out, Kennemer did have direct knowledge.

In an interview, he explained he was driving around the New Orleans area with his wife, Cherie, one recent summer and they kept spotting these signs for daiquiris. The signs were attached to buildings with drive-thru windows. Blended frozen daiquiris are made with rum, lime juice and sweetener and have the consistency of iced smoothies. They come in many fruity flavors, plus chocolate.

""So after seeing this and being tempted multiple times,"" he said, ""and thinking what in the world could this possibly be, we drove into one and ended up ordering daiquiris.""

PolitiFact Oregon: Did you order the drinks and then drive off?

Kennemer (small voice): ""I’m afraid we did.""

So there’s your evidence. Still, we understand that readers may want legal proof of proofed drinks to-go by vehicle, other than the word of a visiting legislator. For that, we contacted Jacques Berry, a spokesman for the Louisiana lieutenant governor’s office.

Berry couldn’t tell us how many such drive-thrus dot the South Louisiana landscape, but he verified that a person doesn’t usually have to go far to find one. For locals, it’s a popular frozen treat on a Friday afternoon. ""It’s not as much of a late-night thing,"" he said.

And why the daiquiri, in particular? Well, Berry thinks it has to do with New Orleans bartenders mixing the ingredients that were plentiful and on hand, in this case, fresh fruit, rum and ice. The drinks caught on.

Donnie Silva, owner of Big Easy Bachelor Parties in New Orleans, says he thinks the blended drinks are popular because of the climate. He was in Las Vegas recently when he says, ""I really wanted a daiquiri. I guess it’s just the heat, we really don’t have a winter. Fifteen of the last 25 Christmases I’ve been in shorts and a T-shirt.""

Which is an utterly foreign concept to Oregonians. As foreign as the daiquiri drive-thru.

(Technically, Louisiana does not allow open containers in vehicles. The way it works is that an attendant hands you a drink and a straw and what you do with those two objects is up to you. Also, in some states, you can buy packaged liquor and beer through a drive-thru window. )

We realize Kennemer is citing an extreme example, and that’s fine, but we should also remind readers that loosening our liquor laws won’t necessarily turn us into Louisiana. California has liquor stores that any kid can enter to buy a pack of gum. And still you can’t get a decent frozen daiquiri to go, by car, or a gin and tonic, by foot.

We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2012/sep/13/bill-kennemer/are-there-daiquiri-drive-thrus-louisiana/
"['Israel', 'Florida', 'John Kerry']","
John Kerry says Netanyahu praised U.S.-Israel relationship
","
Responding to Republican complaints that President Barack Obama has not been fully supportive of Israel, Democrats are launching a strident defense.

U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and his party’s 2004 presidential nominee, defended Obama’s policies at the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6.

""Barack Obama promised always to stand with Israel to tighten sanctions on Iran—and take nothing off the table. Again and again, the other side has lied about where this president stands and what this president has done,"" Kerry said. ""But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straight—he said, our two countries have ‘exactly the same policy…’—’our security cooperation is unprecedented...’ When it comes to Israel, I'll take the word of Israel's prime minister over Mitt Romney any day.""

Kerry’s remarks seemed to answer criticism from Romney’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. There, Romney said that Obama ""has thrown allies like Israel under the bus."" 
Both parties are clamoring for the Jewish vote in this election. Although Jewish Americans overwhelmingly voted for Obama in 2008, even a slight decrease in November could make a difference in crucial swing states such as Florida. 
We wanted to see if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually said what Kerry claimed and if it supported his overall point in rebutting Romney’s criticism.

 Romney’s criticism of Obama on Israel

Romney has criticized Obama and his administration with respect to Israel on multiple fronts. Most often, he’s said that Obama hasn’t done enough to stop Iran’s alleged quest to obtain nuclear weapons.

But he’s also criticized Obama for not visiting Israel as president (we rated that True) and not recognizing the country’s capital as Jerusalem (we rated that Half True.) Obama later got the Democrats to reinsert language in their party platform that says Jerusalem is the capital.

It’s not clear from Romney’s criticism that his policies would be different from Obama’s, a point we’ll look at more closely in just a bit. But Romney regularly criticizes the administration for not being supportive enough of Israel.

Our research shows that the relationship between the United States and Israel is generally strong, although there have been some tensions between Obama and Netanyahu that have grown more prominent as election day nears.

In fact, one of the quotes Kerry invoked came from just such a time, going back to 2011 when Netanyahu and Obama exchanged public remarks on how the Middle East peace process should proceed. 
""Our security cooperation is unprecedented""

In a speech at the State Department on May 19, 2011, Obama expressed support for two states, adding, ""The borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps.""

Obama’s idea wasn’t new -- the New York Times reported that President George W. Bush and Bill Clinton directed their staff to pursue the same idea -- but his comments angered Israeli officials.

The New York Times noted that the 1967 border issue ""has always been privately understood, not spoken publicly, and certainly not publicly endorsed by a sitting American president.""

A day after Obama’s comments, the two leaders met at the White House. Here’s how the Washington Post reported the meeting:

""After the president's brief welcome, the prime minister leaned into him with cameras catching every moment. He suggested bluntly that Obama had little, if any, understanding of how peace efforts and the broader Middle East worked.

""’I think for there to be peace, the Palestinians are going to have to accept some basic realities,’ Netanyahu told him. Publicly calm, Obama was privately irate at the treatment.""

Then Netanyahu made his own speech on May 23, 2011.

""Yesterday, President Obama spoke about his iron-clad commitment to Israel's security,"" Netanyahu said. ""He rightly said that our security cooperation is unprecedented."" That’s the line Kerry quoted.

Netanyahu also thanked both American political parties and said the two countries ""stand shoulder to shoulder fighting common enemies, protecting common interests"" and were cooperating in science, technology and other areas.

But near the end of his speech, Netanyahu said this: ""Tomorrow in Congress, I'll describe what a peace between a Palestinian state and the Jewish State could look like. But I want to assure you of one thing. It must leave Israel with security. And therefore, Israel cannot return to the indefensible 1967 lines.""

The news from Netanyahu’s speech wasn’t that he said something nice about America’s president and the U.S. The news was about the 1967 border spat.

Our two countries have ""exactly the same policy""

The other line Kerry quotes came from Netanyahu’s remarks of March 2012 when he said that the U.S. and Israel have ""exactly the same policy"" with respect to Iran:

""I want to explain why Iran must never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons,"" Netanyahu said.  ""U.S. President Barack Obama has reiterated his commitment to prevent that from happening. He stated clearly that all options are on the table, and that American policy is not containment. Well, Israel has exactly the same policy. We are determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons; we leave all options on the table; and containment is definitely not an option....""

But in the same speech Netanyahu also said diplomacy and sanctions haven’t worked:

""I appreciate President Obama’s recent efforts to impose even tougher sanctions against Iran.  These sanctions are hurting Iran’s economy, but unfortunately, Iran’s nuclear program continues to march forward. Israel has waited patiently for the international community to resolve this issue.  We’ve waited for diplomacy to work.  We’ve waited for sanctions to work.  None of us can afford to wait much longer.""

As we were preparing this report, Netanyahu was again complaining about U.S. actions on Iran.

""Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don’t have a moral right to place a red light before Israel,"" he said.

Policy differences between Obama and Romney

We asked Aaron David Miller, a former State Department advisor on Arab-Israeli affairs for Democrat and Republican Secretaries of State, about the differences between Romney and Obama on Israel. Miller wrote an article debunking myths about Israel and U.S. foreign policy published in the Jewish Journal the day after the conventions.

He had criticisms for both political parties. He said it's a myth that Obama is hostile to Israel, and that  Romney’s comment that Obama has ""thrown  Israel under the bus"" is ""ridiculous.""

But he also noted that Obama supporters are wrong to claim Obama is just as pro-Israel as Clinton or Bush.

""Combined with a tendency to see the conflict through the more detached unemotional filter of American national interests, Obama doesn’t have the instinctive emotional attachment to Israel of Bill Clinton or George W. Bush,"" Miller wrote.

If Romney won, ""he’d probably give more slack on the issues of settlements and the peace process,"" Miller wrote, and would be ""personally sympathetic to the notion of bombing before accepting an Iranian bomb.""

""The fact is, with the exception of the peace process that isn’t right now, Romney’s policies toward Israel would be much more rhetorically supportive but not that much different than Obama’s. The tone of the relationship would change — more warmth and good cheer — but I would bet that within a year Netanyahu would find some way to begin to annoy even his best friend Mitt Romney.""

Netanyahu and Romney have known each other since they worked together in Boston in the 1970s.

Our ruling

During his speech at the DNC, Kerry answered Romney’s criticism of Obama’s Israel policy with these words: ""But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straight—he said, our two countries have ‘exactly the same policy…’—’our security cooperation is unprecedented...’""

Kerry did accurately quote Netanyahu’s remarks in 2011 and 2012. But Kerry omitted any discussion of the real tensions that exist between Obama and Netanyahu, particularly about Obama’s 2011 comments on Israel’s 1967 borders. And Kerry ignored Netanyahu’s statements in 2012 that showed he wasn’t keen on waiting for diplomacy to work in Iran for much longer.

"['Bipartisanship', 'Texas', 'Mark Strama']","
Mark Strama says Rush Limbaugh made it clear he’d rather see the country fail than President Barack Obama succeed
","
Texas state Rep. Mark Strama brought up conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh while speaking over breakfast to Texas delegates at the Democratic National Convention, the Austin American-Statesman noted in a Sept. 5, 2012, news blog post.

Strama, D-Austin, said Barack Obama’s success in turning out new voters in 2008 led to Republican operatives dedicating themselves to making sure that never recurs.

""That’s why you have Rush Limbaugh making it clear he would rather see the country fail than this president succeed,"" Strama said.

A reader suggested that Strama mangled Limbaugh’s statement. We decided to check.

Given that Limbaugh is a conservative radio personality, it’s not surprising he would dart Obama. And he has repeatedly said he hopes Obama fails as president, though he also has indicated there were ways for Obama to succeed.

Limbaugh’s original comment along these lines aired shortly before the Democrat’s January 2009 inauguration. During the Jan. 16, 2009, episode of his program, Limbaugh noted that other ""people on our side of the aisle"" had expressed hopes that Obama succeed. In contrast, Limbaugh said, ""I've been listening to Barack Obama for a year and a half. I know what his politics are. I know what his plans are, as he has stated them. I don't want them to succeed. If I wanted Obama to succeed, I'd be happy the Republicans have laid down. And I would be encouraging Republicans to lay down and support him.

""Look, what he's talking about is the absorption of as much of the private sector by the U.S. government as possible, from the banking business, to the mortgage industry, the automobile business, to health care. I do not want the government in charge of all of these things. I don't want this to work.""

Limbaugh then said that in response to a request that he write about his hopes for Obama, he was thinking of replying: ""I hope he fails,"" words he repeated later in the segment after talking about how liberals treated Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush. ""Were the liberals out there hoping Bush succeeded or were they out there trying to destroy him before he was even inaugurated? Why do we have to play the game by their rules? Why do we have to accept the premise here that because of the historical nature of his presidency, that we want him to succeed?"" Limbaugh said.

Web searches led us to additional instances of Limbaugh saying he hoped Obama -- and his policies -- would fail.

For a Fox News program aired Jan. 21, 2009, Limbaugh was asked by commentator Sean Hannity if he wanted Obama to succeed. Limbaugh replied that while he was hearing many Republicans say so, he had suspicions about Obama’s plans.

Limbaugh: ""Now if he turns out to be a Reagan, if he adds Reagan to his recipe of FDR and Lincoln, and if he does cut some taxes,"" references to Ronald Reagan, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.

Hannity: ""Yes.""

Limbaugh: ""If he does not eliminate the Bush tax cuts, I would call that success. So yes, I would hope he would succeed if he acts like Reagan, but if he's going to do FDR, if he's going to do the new New Deal all over, which we will call here the Raw Deal, why would I want him to succeed?""

Limbaugh then said that if Obama was going to implement a ""far-left"" agenda -- including ""nationalized"" health care -- that would be the ""end of America as we have known it because that's then going to set the stage for everything being government owned, operated or provided. Why would I want that to succeed? I don't believe in that. I know that's not how this country is going to be great in the future, it's not what made this country great.

""So I shamelessly say, no, I want him to fail, if his agenda is a far-left collectivism, some people say socialism, as a conservative heartfelt, deeply, why would I want socialism to succeed?""

Limbaugh revisited his hope that Obama fail in a Feb. 13, 2009, segment of his program about the Democratic-steered economic stimulus plan; a February 2009 appearance before the Conservative Political Action Conference; a May 10, 2011, segment focused on Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels; and a June 4, 2012, segment in which he suggested a critical listener was distorting his original point.

Limbaugh said at the CPAC meeting: ""What is so strange about being honest about saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation? Why would I want that to succeed?""

Nowhere did we find an instance of Limbaugh saying he’d rather see the country fail than the president succeed.

By email and in a telephone interview, Strama told us he deliberately has not said that Limbaugh used those precise words. 
But the conclusion that Limbaugh wanted the country to fail is self-evident, Strama said, especially because Limbaugh initially piped up before Obama had even been sworn in at a time the economy was in freefall. Saying that this analysis is his inference, Strama said: ""If you get 100 people who share my view of politics, they would all agree with me.""

By email, Strama said: ""Limbaugh's remarks must be judged in this context. It is one thing to disagree with the president's policies. It is another thing altogether to root for the failure of those policies -- with all the associated misery that such failure would cause -- so that your party can win an election that is four years away. If a Democrat had hoped Bush's Iraq policy failed, with the consequences such failure would hold for our troops, it would be reprehensible, almost treasonous. Given the economic conditions in January 2009, hoping for the failure of the American government's policies at that time was also reprehensible and almost treasonous.""

More broadly, Strama wrote, unless ""you believe that policy has no consequence to the well-being of our people and our country, it is logically impossible to hope a president's policies fail while hoping the best for our country."" In a follow-up email, Strama said it is possible to oppose a policy and still wish the country to succeed, but Limbaugh’s focus on Obama failing so Republicans could recapture power -- at the expense of national difficulties -- crosses a line.

We emailed Limbaugh and did not hear back.

Our ruling

Strama said Limbaugh made it clear he’d rather see the country fail than Obama succeed.

Limbaugh has been clear about hoping Obama and his policies fail. Far as we can tell, though, he has not said he would prefer that the country fails, though Strama openly infers as much.

Our sense is this statement contains an element of truth, but it's otherwise speculative. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/13/mark-strama/mark-strama-says-rush-limbaugh-made-it-clear-hed-r/

Jon Bramnick claims Barack Obama promised stimulus would push jobless rate below 6 percent
","
While critiquing the president on his leadership of the economy, a state assemblyman reprised a popular -- and misleading -- Republican talking point.

Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick said President Barack Obama has failed to deliver on a vow to push down the nation’s jobless rate, fueling discontent among the unemployed.

""I think the American public, those who are unemployed, are somewhat angry. The president promised that if he spent money on a stimulus program that unemployment would go to 5.7 percent or 6 percent. Those were his words,"" Bramnick said in a Sept. 7 interview on NJToday. ""We've been stuck at 8 percent unemployment.""

PolitiFact and its partner sites have checked various iterations of this claim, each time rating it Mostly False.

Most recently, PolitiFact Ohio gave Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Latta a Mostly False for saying that Obama promised that with the stimulus plan, ""unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now.""

While such claims have an element of truth -- top economic advisers in the incoming Obama administration released a report projecting that if the stimulus plan passed the unemployment rate would peak around 8 percent before dropping to less than 6 percent by now -- we found no evidence the president or his administration ever made a promise.

Bramnick owned up to that part, saying, ""I'm guilty of using a word that may not have been his word.""

But, he said, ""I’m very comfortable with my statement. Though you’re right it wasn’t a promise, it was material he used for Congress and others to rely on passing the stimulus program.""

Bramnick, like other Republicans, cited as support for his statement a Jan. 9, 2009 report from Christina Romer, the incoming chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who would serve as the vice president's top economic adviser.

The report -- released more than a month before the stimulus bill, officially called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, was signed into law -- estimated the impact of Obama’s plan on job creation.

Without the stimulus plan, the unemployment rate was estimated to top off around 9 percent in 2010 before dropping off to roughly 6 percent by now.

But with the stimulus plan, the report projected the nation’s jobless rate would peak near 8 percent in 2009 before falling to about 5.5 percent by now.

What we know now is that even with the stimulus plan the unemployment rate topped off at 10 percent in October 2009. It has since dropped, hitting 8.1 percent last month.

So the estimates in the report were wrong.

But they were projections, not a guarantee as Republicans suggest. And the projections were made with plenty of disclaimers.

In the beginning of the report, the authors write, ""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" noting that there is ""fundamental uncertainty"" with estimating the effects of any program and ""the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

Our ruling

Bramnick said ""the president promised that if he spent money on a stimulus program that unemployment would go to 5.7 percent or 6 percent. Those were his words.""

We found no evidence the president or his advisers ever made a public pledge that the stimulus would drive the unemployment rate down to the figures Bramnick cites.

Two economic advisers estimated in a 2009 report that with the stimulus plan, the unemployment rate would peak near 8 percent before dropping to less than 6 percent by now.

But those projections came with heavy disclaimers, with the authors emphasizing the considerable uncertainty of their estimates.

Those are critical details Bramnick’s statement ignores.

We rate this statement Mostly False.

Charlie Bass attacks Anne Kuster and Obamacare in TV ad
","
U.S. Rep. Charlie Bass survived a challenge from four opponents in this week’s Republican primary. But, even as the election approached, Bass was already focusing his attacks more on his Democratic challenger, Concord attorney Ann McLane Kuster.

In an ad released August 27, 2012, Bass, a Peterborough Republican, attacks Kuster, his opponent in the 2010 campaign, for being a hyper-liberal partisan, citing her support for the national health care reform law as evidence.

""She supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion,"" a narrator says in the ad, titled ""Not Working.""

""Annie, that’s not working together,"" the narrator scolds. ""That’s not working for any of us.""

Kuster, who lostto Bass by 1.6 percent of the vote in the 2010 campaign, has been outspoken in her support of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. In August of 2010, as referenced in Bass’ ad, she told WMUR-TV ""I think health care reform was a historic first step.""

""Thirty million Americans will now have health insurance … and we've prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage right when you need it most,"" she said at the time.

But, does her support for the Affordable Care Act really translate to support for a government takeover of health care? And does the health care law really ""rob"" $700 billion from Medicare?

According to past PolitiFact rulings, the answer is no.

In past rulings, PolitiFact has disagreed strongly with the classification of the Affordable Care Act as a government takeover of healthcare. In recent months, these rulings have ranged from False to Pants on Fire, and in 2010, PolitiFact editors named the claim its Lie of the Year.

In that ruling, PolitiFact reported that the term ""government takeover"" refers to a European approach where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are public employees. By contrast, under the Affordable Care Act, the government will not take control of hospitals or doctors. Employers will continue to provide health insurance to most patients through private insurance companies, and the law does not include a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers, the article noted.

""The label 'government takeover’ has no basis in reality, but instead reflects a political dynamic where conservatives label any increase in government authority in health care as a ‘takeover.,"" Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said at the time.

Looking to the second part of Bass’ statement, PolitiFact has also taken issue with similar claims about the Affordable Care Act robbing Medicare.

Last month, for instance, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney earned a Mostly False rating for his claim that Obama ""robbed Medicare (of) $716 billion to pay for for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare."" In this fact-check,PolitiFact noted that neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut any money from the Medicare budget.

Instead, the law included a number of changes seeking to lower future Medicare costs. Initially, the Congressional Budget Office estimated those reductions to total about $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. But, more recently, the CBO updated its projected reductions to about $716 billion between 2013 and 2022.

Bass references this updated figure in his attack on Kuster, but neither in his ad, nor in Romney’s claim, can these spending reductions be reasonably considered ""robbing.""

As noted in the Romney piece, Democrats included the Medicare cuts in the law to avoid adding to the deficit, and the proposal was debated in the open for many weeks as it made its way through Congress.

Several days after his initial claim, Romney made another reference to the Medicare cuts, this time says that the president’s plan ""cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare.""

PolitiFact rated that statement Half True, saying that, although Romney’s got his numbers right, his claim suggests that the law re-routes funding already allocated to Medicare to finance the health care law. As noted before, the law works to reduce future Medicare spending and frees up savings that are then used to offset the costs of the health care law.

As a sidenote, PolitiFact has also ruled that Romney’s vice presidential nominee, U.S. Rep Paul Ryan, relies on the same $700 billion in Medicare savings in his own budget plan.

Our Ruling:

Had Bass been careful in his wording, there might have been some truth to his claims. Kuster has expressed support for the Affordable Care Act, and the law has been shown to reduce Medicare spending by $700 billion. But, instead, the Congressman repeated past claims that the Care Act constitutes a ""government takeover"" of health care, and that it ""robs"" $700 billion from Medicare.

The government takeover part is so wrong it's been rated Pants on Fire; the Medicare part is Mostly False. On balance, we rate the full claim False.",/factchecks/2012/sep/12/charles-bass/charlie-bass-attacks-anne-kuster-and-obamacare-tv-/
